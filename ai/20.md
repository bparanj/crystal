Chapter 3 - Common Algorithms

What’s an IIFE in Javascript, why would I need one, and how would I create one?

What would be the equivalent of that code if we were to use classes in TypeScript instead?

Given an array that looks like the following array, find all puzzles of size 4 or 8. (I then pasted the puzzles array).

I have an array in TypeScript with the following shape. (I pasted the above JSON here). I want to convert it from an array to a hash array so that can address each object by its "id".

Create a function in JavaScript that will output the puzzles array as an HTML table

Chapter 4 - Learning RxJS

What does the following code block do?

const firstSolution$ = puzzles$.pipe(
  filter(puzzle => puzzle.size === 4),
  map(puzzle => puzzle.solution[0])
);

Chapter 5 - Angular’s HttpClient

Build me a complete angular service that fetches some sample data (perhaps blog posts) from a remote web service. Be sure to log any errors encountered. Then create a web page implemented as an angular component, which displays the blog post titles from the service in an unordered list. Prefer to use the angular async pipe in the template rather than subscribing to the observable.

Chapter 6 - Regular Expressions

Give me a regular expression to validate an email address

Give me a regex that can validate any phone number, us or international, liberally accepting common punctuation.

Give me a regex to find all URLs from img and a tags in the text of an HTML page.

Give me a regex matching URLs found in an arbitrary document of text, which may or may not be HTML.

Give me a regex to validate password complexity with the following rules: Passwords much contain at least one number, one lowercase and one uppercase letter, one symbol, and be 8 characters or longer.

Give me a regex that will validate that the input is a US currency

Given a potential list of different ways to write US currency, write a regular expression that will match all of these: $1 .22 $.25 0.79 1.49 $0.00 $0.43 $1,230,847,369.99

Write a regex that will validate the the input is a valid SSN.

Implement a function to validate a credit card number using the Lunh Algorithm

Write a regex to recognize all HTMl tags in the input text.

Go back to giving me raw regexes, not wrapped in python

Chapter 7 - Data Generation

```
// Create an array of all possible card values

// Function to shuffle the deck

// Shuffle the deck using built-in Javascript array functionality

// Create an array of all possible card values

// Create an array of possible grocery items

// Create an array of possible stock symbols
```

Chapter 8 - Agile Project Management

The application will store and manage the attendance for a single classroom. It will store the names and contact information for the class roster and the students’ parents. It will provide a way to add, edit, and remove students, as well as the ability to mark the students absent or present for a given day. The app will run on both desktop web, iOS, and Android. It will also connect to the device's camera to add a photograph of each student.

Given that description, create a few agile epics that will help direct the development of the application. I envision three different visual screens for the application. A home page, a roster page, and a student details page. Add those to the epics and stories.

Generate some user acceptance criteria for the stories in epic 1 using the "given, when, then" syntax

Given the relative difficulties of those tasks and their UAC, generate a rough relative estimate for each using T-shirt sizing.

Chapter 9 - Let’s Build an App!

What is the newest version of Angular and Ionic Framework you know of?

Using Angular and the Ionic Framework, create a complete web application that uses a split-pane layout with a side menu and a default Home page. It should have an Angular service to load blog posts from a remote sample API. Those blog posts should be displayed on a page called Posts. The Posts page should be responsive, displaying the blog post titles and body in an <ion-card>. When working with Observables, prefer the async pipe over subscribing and unsubscribing. Make sure you provide the Ionic CLI commands to create the application and any additional items needed to create the application.

Chapter 10 - Unit Testing

Given the following Angular service, write a complete suite of unit tests using Jasmine. <I pasted the entire class code here>

Chapter 11 - Other Considerations

What do you believe the significance of the masked name might be?

Add photo (#23)

    * Added capacitor and capacitor storage

    * Converted student service to promises?

    * Fixed DeleteStudent, but not perfectly

    * Removed RxJS from storage service

    * Student CRUD working

    * Added some more functionality

    * Refactored some of the storage code

    * Added New Student functionality

    * Added camera feature

    * Standardize state management within the student service (#22)
