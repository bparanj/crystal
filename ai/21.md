| List           | Discuss         | Execute        | Decompose      | Debate         | Devise         |
| Locate         | Exemplify       | Illustrate     | Deconstruct    | Defend         | Formulate      |
| Memorize       | Explain         | Implement      | Deduce         | Estimate       | Hypothesize    |

### Achievable by AI:

- **Remembering**: AI can Define, Duplicate, Find, Identify, Label, List, Locate, and Memorize information, especially through data retrieval and pattern recognition techniques.

- **Understanding**: AI can Classify, Convert, Differentiate, and Explain data through machine learning models. Describing and Discussing can be partially achieved by advanced natural language processing (NLP) tools.

- **Applying**: AI can Apply, Calculate, Carry out (specific tasks within a defined scope), Edit (based on learned rules or patterns), Execute (predefined tasks), and Implement algorithms or processes.

- **Analyzing**: AI tools are capable of Analyzing, Attributing, Categorizing, Comparing, Contrasting, Decomposing, and Deconstructing data, particularly through data analysis and machine learning models.

- **Evaluating**: Some aspects like Appraise, Assess, Choose, and Estimate can be approached with AI, especially in areas like data analysis where predictive modeling and decision-making algorithms are used. Argue, Critique, Debate, and Defend are more challenging due to the requirement for deep understanding and reasoning, but advances in NLP and AI models aimed at argumentation are making progress.

- **Creating**: AI can Assemble, Construct, Create, Design, Develop, and Devise new content, designs, or solutions, particularly with the advent of generative AI technologies. Formulating complex new theories (Hypothesize) remains a more human-driven task, though AI can assist in data-driven hypothesis generation.

### Limitations:
While AI can perform tasks across all these categories, the depth, quality, and context of understanding and creativity are areas where human intervention is often still necessary, particularly for complex, nuanced tasks requiring deep understanding, ethical considerations, or creative intuition. AI's capabilities in Evaluating and Creating are growing but are typically guided or augmented by human input to ensure relevance, accuracy, and ethical alignment.

## Current Limitations

Current AI tools, despite their advances, still face challenges in fully achieving tasks that require deep contextual understanding, abstract reasoning, and genuine creativity, especially those that involve complex human emotions or ethical considerations. Here are some items from the table that represent areas where AI tools might currently fall short or cannot perform without significant human oversight:

### Understanding:
- **Discuss**: While AI can simulate discussions based on pattern recognition in data, genuine engagement in nuanced discussions, especially those requiring understanding of complex human emotions or subtle context, remains challenging.
- **Exemplify**: AI can provide examples from existing data but might struggle to select contextually appropriate examples in nuanced or abstract scenarios without human guidance.

### Evaluating:
- **Argue**: AI can simulate arguments based on data and recognized patterns but lacks the ability to genuinely understand or engage in complex argumentation involving nuanced logic, ethics, or emotional persuasion.
- **Critique**: AI's ability to critique is limited to parameters it has been trained on. Genuine critique that requires deep understanding of context, intent, and subtleties of human creativity is beyond current AI capabilities.
- **Debate**: Similar to arguing, while AI can simulate debate on a technical level, it lacks the depth of understanding, empathy, and ethical reasoning required for genuine human debate on complex subjects.
- **Defend**: AI can provide data-driven defenses of positions but lacks the capacity for emotional empathy and ethical judgment needed to defend positions in a deeply human or morally nuanced context.

### Creating:
- **Devise**: While AI can generate solutions within known parameters, devising innovative solutions that require out-of-the-box thinking or deep theoretical insights remains a largely human domain.
- **Formulate**: AI can help in formulating hypotheses based on data patterns, but the creative insight and theoretical leap required for groundbreaking hypotheses are beyond AI's current reach.
- **Hypothesize**: AI can generate data-driven hypotheses but understanding the broader context, integrating disparate domains of knowledge, and the creative leap required for significant scientific hypotheses are areas where human researchers excel.

### Limitations and Human-AI Collaboration:
These limitations highlight the distinction between tasks that AI can perform based on patterns, data, and predefined rules, and tasks that require human-like understanding, creativity, and ethical judgment. While AI tools excel at processing and analyzing large volumes of data, generating content within learned parameters, and automating well-defined tasks, they do not possess genuine consciousness, empathy, or moral reasoning.

As AI technology continues to evolve, the collaboration between human intelligence and artificial intelligence becomes increasingly crucial. Human oversight ensures that AI's capabilities are directed and utilized ethically, creatively, and effectively, especially in complex, nuanced tasks requiring deep understanding and judgment.
