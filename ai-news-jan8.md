### **Adopt**

1. **Phi-4 Model by Microsoft**  
   Microsoft’s Phi-4 model, released under the MIT license, offers strong reasoning capabilities and fine-tuning flexibility while maintaining a small size (14B parameters).  
   - *Why Adopt?* Open-source licensing and competitive performance make it a practical choice for reasoning tasks and smaller-scale deployments.

2. **Speculative Decoding for Faster LLM Inference**  
   Speculative Decoding implementation in llama.cpp yields a 25-60% increase in processing speed without significant loss in accuracy.  
   - *Why Adopt?* Increases efficiency in real-time applications and large-scale model deployments.

3. **Unsloth API and Training Web UI**  
   New local APIs and web UIs enable fine-tuning and merging of LoRA adapters seamlessly.  
   - *Why Adopt?* Streamlines the model training process and supports diverse LoRA use cases.

---

### **Trial**

1. **NVIDIA Cosmos**  
   A world foundation model trained on 20 million hours of video, Cosmos is designed to build virtual worlds and generate synthetic data for testing.  
   - *Why Trial?* Promising for simulation-heavy industries like robotics and autonomous systems, but broader applications need validation.

2. **NVIDIA Digits (Grace Blackwell Superchip)**  
   A compact AI system supporting up to 200B-parameter models locally, offering high performance for edge AI and research purposes.  
   - *Why Trial?* Viable for local model development and prototyping, though hardware and cost constraints may limit adoption.

3. **DeepSeek V3 Quantization**  
   DeepSeek V3 with 2-8 bit quantization enables running massive models locally on high-resource setups (e.g., 48GB RAM).  
   - *Why Trial?* Optimizes resource usage for large models but requires careful evaluation of trade-offs in performance and compatibility.

---

### **Assess**

1. **LangChain Integrations**  
   New LangChain packages enhance integration with tools like Ollama-OCR and simplify application development for LLM-powered solutions.  
   - *Why Assess?* Offers flexibility for complex workflows but may require significant setup and maintenance.

2. **AI in Software Development (CodeLLM)**  
   CodeLLM enables frontend code generation from mocks, with plans for backend context integration.  
   - *Why Assess?* Shows potential in improving development productivity, though real-world usability needs further exploration.

3. **Multi-GPU Support for Unsloth**  
   Unsloth currently lacks multi-GPU training capabilities, with plans to make this a commercial feature.  
   - *Why Assess?* Evaluate cost-benefit trade-offs for scaling training tasks with multiple GPUs.

### **Hold**

1. **FP4 Precision for GPUs (NVIDIA)**  
   NVIDIA’s promotion of FP4 as a metric for GPU performance has sparked skepticism due to unclear benefits over FP8.  
   - *Why Hold?* Until real-world benchmarks validate its effectiveness, adoption is premature.

2. **AI21 Labs’ Model Security Concerns**  
   Reports of malicious tokens claiming association with AI21 Labs emphasize the need for stricter vigilance.  
   - *Why Hold?* Limit deployment of models until platform security and official affiliations are clarified.
