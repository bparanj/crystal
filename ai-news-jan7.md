### **Adopt**
1. **NVIDIA Cosmos**  
   NVIDIA's Cosmos, an open-source video world model trained on 20 million hours of video, is revolutionizing robotics and autonomous driving. It sets a benchmark for using video data to train AI models with broad applications across industries.  
   - *Why Adopt?* Accelerates understanding of basic physics through vast datasets, with strong potential in manufacturing and autonomous systems.  

2. **Fine-Tuning Llama Models**  
   The success of continual pretraining (e.g., Llama 3.2 3B) with high-quality domain-specific data demonstrates significant improvements in specific tasks like mathematics.  
   - *Why Adopt?* Enables model specialization and targeted performance gains without degrading general capabilities.

---

### **Trial**
1. **NVIDIA Digits**  
   NVIDIA’s $3,000 AI supercomputer (Project DIGITS) provides accessible local AI computing for models up to 200 billion parameters.  
   - *Why Trial?* Ideal for prototyping large models locally, though questions remain about performance limitations and cost scalability.

2. **Speculative Decoding**  
   Emerging techniques in LLM inference, such as speculative decoding, promise significant speed improvements with minimal accuracy trade-offs.  
   - *Why Trial?* Optimizes LLM throughput across platforms and could redefine efficiency standards for production-scale deployments.

---

### **Assess**
1. **FP4 vs. FP8 Precision for GPUs**  
   NVIDIA's shift to FP4 for RTX 5090 raises concerns about marketing transparency and real-world implications for AI workloads.  
   - *Why Assess?* Critical to benchmark and validate the practical trade-offs of FP4 performance metrics for industry adoption.  

2. **Ontological Embeddings**  
   Moving from token-based to concept-based embeddings offers potential for deeper semantic understanding in AI applications.  
   - *Why Assess?* Promising for improving contextual relevance in models but requires further validation on scalability and accuracy.

---

### **Hold**
1. **Deepspeed Zero-3**  
   Reports of no significant memory gains during multi-GPU training highlight issues with gradient checkpointing overhead.  
   - *Why Hold?* Until resolved, existing approaches like efficient fine-tuning or other optimizers remain more reliable.

2. **OpenAI Agents Deployment Delays**  
   Prompt injection vulnerabilities delay broader deployment of OpenAI agents, and pricing strategies suggest enterprise-only focus.  
   - *Why Hold?* Consider alternate solutions until security and accessibility are clarified.
