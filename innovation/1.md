"Subsequence Matching" is a specific algorithmic concept dealing with patterns and sequences within computer science. Here are several concepts at a similar level of abstraction, focusing on data structures, algorithms, and related computational theories:

1. **Pattern Matching**: Algorithms for finding occurrences of a pattern within a larger text or dataset.

2. **Sorting Algorithms**: Techniques for arranging elements in a list or database in a specific order (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort).

3. **Graph Traversal**: Methods for visiting all the nodes or vertices in a graph (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search).

4. **Hashing**: Techniques for converting data into a fixed-size value or key,  used for fast data retrieval.

5. **Dynamic Programming**: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid computing the same results multiple times.

6. **Greedy Algorithms**: Approaches for solving optimization problems by making the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum.

7. **Tree Traversals**: Algorithms for visiting all the nodes in a tree data structure (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order).

8. **Finite Automata**: Models of computation used to simulate sequential logic and pattern detection within input strings.

9. **Regular Expressions**: Sequences of characters that define search patterns, mainly for use in pattern matching with strings.

10. **Data Compression**: Techniques for reducing the size of data to save storage space or transmission time.

11. **String Algorithms**: Algorithms specifically designed to process sequences of characters,  substring search, string matching, and transformations.

12. **Cryptography**: Techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties, focusing on encryption and decryption algorithms.

These concepts share a similar level of specificity and applicability as "Subsequence Matching," each addressing different aspects of computer science theory and application.

In a computer science textbook, an equivalent concept to "Corona Discharge" from a physics textbook—considering its specificity and the fact that it pertains to a particular phenomenon within a broader field—might be "Garbage Collection."

**Corona Discharge** is a process where an electric current flows from an electrode with a high potential into a neutral fluid, usually air, leading to ionization and discharge without a significant current flow in a material medium. It's specific to the study of electromagnetism within physics, detailing a precise and complex process.

**Garbage Collection**, similarly, is a specific process within the broader field of computer science, particularly in memory management. It refers to the automatic detection and freeing up of memory that is no longer in use by the program. Garbage collection is crucial in languages that automate memory management, like Java and Python, preventing memory leaks and optimizing program performance.

Both concepts are specialized within their respective fields, focusing on the management of resources—electrical and memory, respectively—and ensuring efficiency and stability in systems (electrical systems for Corona Discharge and computational systems for Garbage Collection).
