## There is No Fountain Like That

The authorities of a certain town decided to build a fountain. A competition was announced. The Committee looked through the designs that were submitted by the architects.

"There is nothing exciting. All this has already been built" said the jury sadly. "We would like to have a fountain that would be the only one of its kind in the whole world."

"Can you think of something better?" asked one of the members of the jury. "People have been building fountains for a long time. The principle is the same - streams of water crossing each other. In one of the projects an architect offered to use a light inside the fountain. This is not new either. There are fountains with fire light - even with color and music."

And suddenly the Inventor appeared.

"I am going to offer a fountain design that nobody has built yet. It is going to be the most beautiful and surprising spectacle!"

Try to figure out what the Inventor offered. Maybe you can continue developing his idea and create a new invention.

## Solution

The Inventor likely proposed creating a fountain that goes beyond traditional designs by incorporating **soap bubbles** to form a captivating and unique spectacle. Instead of relying solely on streams of water, this fountain would produce soap bubbles in various sizes and shapes, creating a dynamic and ever-changing display as they rise and dance atop the water [Triz the Right Solution at the Right Time A Guide to Innovative Problem Solving - Yuri Salamatov].

By adding luminescent pigments to the soap solution, the bubbles would emit a beautiful, dynamic light effect, especially when illuminated at night. This would result in a mesmerizing experience that combines the gentle movement of bubbles with a vibrant light show, offering something truly new in the "art of fountains" [Triz the Right Solution at the Right Time A Guide to Innovative Problem Solving - Yuri Salamatov].

To further develop this idea and create an even more innovative fountain, we could consider:

- **Interactive Water Films**: Implementing devices that create dome-like water films for decoration, which can serve as screens for projecting images or light patterns. Visitors could walk through or around these water domes, enhancing the interactive experience.

- **Reduced Hydraulic Resistance**: Incorporating surfactants like polyacrylamide into the water to make it 'slippery,' thereby increasing the height and reach of water jets without requiring additional pump power [Triz the Right Solution at the Right Time A Guide to Innovative Problem Solving - Yuri Salamatov].

- **Musical Elements**: Designing the fountain to produce sounds or 'sing' by integrating musical components that harmonize with the movement of water and bubbles, creating a multisensory experience [Triz the Right Solution at the Right Time A Guide to Innovative Problem Solving - Yuri Salamatov].

By blending these innovative features, the fountain would offer an extraordinary and surprising spectacle, distinguishing it as a one-of-a-kind attraction that delights residents and visitors alike.
