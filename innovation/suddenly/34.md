One day, the president of a toy company invited his engineers to a meeting and asked them if they could invent a new doll based on Vanka-vstanka.

The engineers said that Nevalyashka (a doll weighted on the bottom so that it always returns to an upright position) and the vanka-vstanka were invented a long time ago. What more can we discover?

This is a very simple toy. The body has a round bottom. The inside is hollow and a weight is attached to the bottom inside. If you try to place the toy on its side it will get up and swing from side to side for a while and then stand upright.

"It is really simple," said the young engineer. "Nothing could be added or removed."

"Inventor Zaitsev has invented a new Vanka-vstanka," argued the director. "Look, Patent #645661 was issued for this new design."

The engineers bent over the new toy. On the outside, this toy looked like the previous ones. The trick was inside. The weight was mounted on a shaft in such a way that it could move along the shaft up or down. The toy could swing standing on its head or lying horizontally.

"This is the law of increasing dynamization," said the chief engineer. "In the beginning, parts of the machine had rigid connections. Later the inventors worked out flexible connections. A toy is like a machine therefore the development of a toy should follow the same laws of development as a machine. I can predict that somebody will come up with a Vanka-Vstanka where the weight is divided and will make these parts moveable," he said.

"It is already figured out," said the president of the company. "This is the Vanka-vstanka invented by inventor Litvinenko. Patent #676290." He placed on the table one more toy of the vanka-vstanka series. The doll was swinging differently, the swinging frequency was changing all the time.

"That's it," said the chief engineer while opening the body of the toy. "The weight is divided, the parts have become moveable in the same way as in an hourglass. The sand is moving from one portion of the glass into the other changing the weight of each portion. Therefore the frequency changes."

"Everything new that has been done was done in another factory!" exclaimed the president. "Are they better than we are? Couldn't we think of something else? You said that there is the Law of Increasing Dynamization. Very well, let's use this law and invent another Vanka-vstanka that will be more dynamic."

And suddenly the inventor appeared.

"The Law is the Law," he said. "There is a way to make this toy more dynamic. I would like to offer...."

What can you suggest?

## Solution

To make the Vanka-vstanka toy more dynamic in line with the Law of Increasing Dynamization, you can introduce elements that allow the toy to adapt and change its behavior, moving it toward self-development. One suggestion is to incorporate a mechanism that enables the toy to alter its center of gravity dynamically. For example, integrating a gyroscopic system or adjustable weights that shift in response to external stimuli or the toy's movement can create new balancing actions and make the toy perform a variety of motions beyond simply returning upright.

Another idea is to embed sensors and actuators within the toy, allowing it to respond to touch, sound, or light. This would enable the Vanka-vstanka to interact with its environment and exhibit a range of behaviors, such as emitting sounds, flashing lights, or changing its movement patterns when stimulated. By adding these interactive features, the toy transitions into the phase of self-development, enhancing its dynamism and appeal.

This approach aligns with the principles of TRIZ, specifically the progression toward increased flexibility and adaptability in system development [Simplified TRIZ New Problem Solving Applications for Technical and Business Professionals, 3rd Edition (Kalevi Rantanen, David W. Conley, Ellen R. Domb.pdf)]. By advancing the toy to the next period, you not only innovate the product but also provide a clear direction for future enhancements.
