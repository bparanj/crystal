**TRIZ Application: Solving the “It Can Disappear By Itself” Problem Involving Inkwell and Sand**

---

**Problem Description:**

In historical times, inkwells were commonly used for writing with quills or dip pens. Spilling ink from an inkwell was a frequent problem, leading to stains on desks, floors, or important documents. Traditional methods of cleaning ink spills involved wiping or blotting, which could spread the stain or damage the surface.

**Objective:**

Find a way for the ink spill to "disappear by itself" without manual cleaning, preventing stains and preserving the integrity of surfaces.

---

**Applying TRIZ Principles:**

**1. Principle 13: "Do It Inversely":**

This principle suggests inverting the usual action to achieve the desired outcome. Instead of actively removing the ink after a spill, consider an approach where the ink removes itself or is prevented from causing stains without direct intervention.

**2. Principle 35: "Change the State of the Physical Property":**

This principle involves altering the physical state or properties of a substance to solve a problem. For the ink spill, changing the ink's state (e.g., from liquid to solid) or altering its properties can make it easier to handle or render it non-problematic.

---

**Solution:**

**Using "Do It Inversely":**

- **Invert the Cleanup Process:** Instead of wiping the ink spill, which can spread the ink further, allow the ink to be absorbed passively by another material.
- **Self-Cleaning Mechanism:** Introduce a substance that interacts with the ink, causing it to be removed without active cleaning.

**Using "Change the State of the Physical Property":**

- **Solidify the Ink:** Change the ink from a liquid to a solid state, making it easier to remove.
- **Absorption and Encapsulation:** Use a material that absorbs the ink and encapsulates it, preventing it from staining the surface.

---

**Implementation with Sand:**

**Step 1: Immediate Application of Sand**

- Upon spilling ink, **immediately sprinkle sand** over the spill.
- The sand acts as an **absorbent material**, drawing the ink into its particles.

**Step 2: Changing the Ink's Physical State**

- The ink, initially in a liquid state that can seep into surfaces and cause stains, becomes **absorbed into the porous structure** of the sand.
- The mixture of sand and ink **changes from a runny liquid to a clumpable solid**, effectively altering the ink's physical property.

**Step 3: Passive Removal**

- After a short time, the sand fully absorbs the ink.
- The **ink-infused sand can then be easily swept away or picked up**, removing the ink from the surface without spreading it.
- This method **prevents direct contact** with the ink and avoids further staining.

**Outcome:**

- **No Stains Left Behind:** The surface remains clean, as the ink does not penetrate or adhere to it.
- **Ink "Disappears by Itself":** The passive absorption makes it appear as though the ink has vanished without active cleaning.

---

**Explanation of TRIZ Principles in Action:**

**"Do It Inversely":**

- **Traditional Cleaning:** Involves direct interaction with the ink (wiping or blotting), which can exacerbate the problem.
- **Inverted Approach:** Instead of trying to remove the ink directly, we allow another material (sand) to interact with the ink, **letting the ink remove itself** from the surface via absorption.

**"Change the State of the Physical Property":**

- **Liquid to Solid Transition:** By adding sand, the ink's state changes from a troublesome liquid to a manageable solid mixture.
- **Altered Behavior:** The ink's ability to stain is neutralized because it's now contained within the sand particles.

---

**Real-World Analogies:**

- **Oil Spill Cleanup:** Similar techniques are used where absorbent materials (like dispersants or absorbent booms) change the state of oil, making it easier to collect.
- **Chemical Spill Kits:** Use absorbent powders that solidify liquids for safe and easy removal.

---

**Benefits of the Solution:**

- **Prevents Surface Damage:** No need for harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaning methods.
- **Efficient and Quick:** Immediate application stops the spread of ink.
- **Simplifies Cleanup:** Transforms a messy spill into an easily removable substance.

By applying the TRIZ principles of "Do It Inversely" and "Change the State of the Physical Property," the ink spill problem is ingeniously solved. The ink is prevented from causing stains without direct cleaning, effectively "disappearing by itself." This solution showcases how creative thinking and the application of inventive principles can address practical problems efficiently.

---

**Additional Insights:**

- **Proactive Measures:** This method encourages a proactive approach—having sand or an absorbent material readily available in areas where ink spills are possible.
- **Material Selection:** While sand is effective, other absorbent materials (like sawdust or specialized absorbent pads) could also be used, potentially offering better absorption or easier cleanup.

**Reflecting on TRIZ Principles:**

The combination of inverting the traditional cleaning process and altering the physical properties of the ink demonstrates the power of TRIZ in problem-solving. By challenging conventional methods and exploring alternative strategies, innovative and effective solutions can emerge.

## Problem 5

**TRIZ Application: Solving the "It Can Disappear By Itself" Problem Involving Inkwell and Sand**

---

**Problem Description:**

*In the past, people used unspillable inkwells. If we fill such an inkwell with sand, how can we remove the sand from the inkwell later? Similarly, foundry engineers once faced a related problem. Forged metal parts needed to be cleaned. Sandblasting machines were used for this purpose. Sand cleans the parts but lodges in cavities. Now we have to remove the sand from the parts. When the parts are big and heavy, it is inconvenient to turn them over and shake the sand out.*

An engineer suggests covering all the holes, but it's too much extra work. The sand does not come out of the cavities by itself.

**The Inventor proposes a solution:**

*"Yes," he said, "the sand can disappear by itself. What we have to do is make sand particles out of..."*

**Question:**

*What should the sand particles be made of?*

---

**Applying TRIZ Principles:**

1. **Principle 13: "Do It Inversely":**

   - **Invert the Problem:** Instead of trying to remove the sand after it has lodged in the cavities, find a way for the sand to remove itself.
   - **Self-Elimination:** Think about how the sand can disappear without manual intervention.

2. **Principle 35: "Change the State of the Physical Property":**

   - **Change the Sand's Physical State:** Modify the physical properties of the sand so that it can change state under certain conditions.
   - **From Solid to Gas or Liquid:** Identify materials that can transition from solid to gas (sublimation) or solid to liquid (melting) and thus eliminate themselves.

---

**Solution:**

**Make Sand Particles Out of Dry Ice (Solid Carbon Dioxide)**

- **Dry Ice as Abrasive Particles:**
  - Replace traditional sand particles with particles made of dry ice.
  - Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide (CO₂) and is commonly used for cooling because it sublimates directly from solid to gas at temperatures above -78.5°C (-109.3°F).

**How the Solution Works:**

1. **Sandblasting with Dry Ice Particles:**

   - Use dry ice particles in the sandblasting machine.
   - The dry ice particles serve the same abrasive function as sand, effectively cleaning the forged metal parts.

2. **Self-Disappearance Through Sublimation:**

   - After impacting and cleaning the surfaces, the dry ice particles absorb heat and sublime.
   - The solid CO₂ transitions directly from solid to gas without becoming liquid.
   - The gaseous CO₂ dissipates into the atmosphere, leaving no residue.

3. **No Residual Particles in Cavities:**

   - Since the dry ice particles turn into gas, there are no particles left to lodge in cavities.
   - The need to physically remove residual sand is eliminated.

---

**Benefits of the Solution:**

- **Eliminates Manual Removal:**

  - No need to turn over or shake heavy parts to remove lodged particles.
  - Saves labor and time in the cleaning process.

- **Non-Abrasive to Surface Integrity:**

  - Dry ice is gentle on the surfaces compared to harder abrasives.
  - Reduces the risk of damaging delicate components.

- **Environmentally Friendly:**

  - CO₂ gas is non-toxic and can be safely vented in well-ventilated areas.
  - Avoids the environmental impact of disposing of used sand, which may contain contaminants.

---

**Explanation of TRIZ Principles in Action:**

**"Do It Inversely":**

- **From Manual Removal to Self-Elimination:**

  - Instead of removing the sand after it gets stuck, the abrasive particles remove themselves by sublimating.
  - The problem is inverted by making the residual particles disappear without external action.

**"Change the State of the Physical Property":**

- **Solid to Gas Transition:**

  - The dry ice particles change their physical state from solid to gas during the cleaning process.
  - This change in state is harnessed to eliminate the unwanted residue.

---

**Application to the Inkwell Problem:**

Similarly, for the unspillable inkwell filled with sand:

- **Issue:**

  - Sand in the inkwell prevents spillage but poses a problem when needing to remove the sand later.

- **Solution Using TRIZ Principles:**

  **Make the Sand Particles Out of Soluble Material (e.g., Salt or Sugar):**

  - **"Do It Inversely":**

    - Instead of manually removing the sand, allow it to dissolve and be removed effortlessly.

  - **"Change the State of the Physical Property":**

    - Use sand-like particles that can change state by dissolving in liquid.

- **Implementation:**

  - **Fill the Inkwell with Soluble Particles:**

    - Use coarse salt or sugar crystals instead of sand.
    - These particles prevent ink spillage similarly to sand.

  - **Removal:**

    - When it's time to remove the particles, add water to dissolve them.
    - The dissolved salt or sugar can then be poured out easily.

- **Benefits:**

  - **Easy Removal:**

    - The particles disappear by dissolving, eliminating the need for manual extraction.

  - **No Residue:**

    - Dissolving ensures no solid residues are left in the inkwell.
