There are certain rules that allow us, during the analysis of the problem, to go from a technical contradiction to a physical one. In many cases the physical contradiction could be formulated from the description of the problem itself.

## Technical Contradiction to Physical Contradiction

When we analyze a problem, we often encounter a **technical contradiction**, which happens when improving one part of a system causes another part to worsen. For example, making a car lighter improves fuel efficiency but might reduce safety due to decreased structural strength.

To find innovative solutions, we can transform this technical contradiction into a **physical contradiction**. A physical contradiction arises when a single element in the system needs to have two opposite properties at the same time. Using the car example, the material needs to be **both lightweight and heavy**â€”light to improve fuel efficiency and heavy to ensure safety.

**How This Transformation Works:**

- **Identify the Technical Contradiction:**
  - Determine the conflicting parameters in the system (e.g., weight vs. safety).

- **Formulate the Physical Contradiction:**
  - Pinpoint the element that requires opposite properties (e.g., the car's material needs to be both light and heavy).

- **Why This Helps:**
  - Focusing on the physical contradiction allows us to explore innovative solutions that resolve the conflict without compromise. It prompts creative thinking, such as developing new materials that are both light and strong.

**Often Directly from the Problem Description:**

In many cases, the physical contradiction can be identified just by carefully reading the problem description. The conflicting requirements are often stated explicitly, making it easier to formulate the physical contradiction without extensive analysis.

**Summary:**

- **Technical Contradiction:** Improving one aspect harms another.
- **Physical Contradiction:** One element needs opposite properties simultaneously.
- **Transition:** By applying certain rules during problem analysis, we move from identifying a technical contradiction to formulating the underlying physical contradiction.
- **Benefit:** This approach helps us find inventive solutions by addressing the root of the problem.
- **Direct Formulation:** Frequently, the physical contradiction is apparent from the problem's description itself.

Explain in simple language and concise way:

The world of inventing has its rules: The higher the degree of the conflict the easier it is to determine and remove it

## The Degree of the Conflict

In the world of inventing, there's an important rule:

**"The bigger the conflict, the easier it is to identify and solve it."**

- **Greater Conflicts Stand Out:** When a problem or conflict is significant, it's more noticeable and easier to pinpoint exactly what's wrong.

- **Clearer Direction for Solutions:** A severe conflict provides a clear focus on what needs to be addressed, making it simpler to find effective solutions.

- **Opportunity for Innovation:** Big problems often push us to think creatively, leading to innovative ideas and breakthroughs that might not occur with smaller issues.

**Example:**

- Imagine trying to adjust a blurry picture. If it's only slightly out of focus, it can be hard to correct. But if it's extremely blurry, you can more easily see what adjustments are needed to make it clear.

**Summary:**

- **Larger Conflicts Simplify Problem-Solving:** The more intense the conflict, the easier it becomes to determine what needs to be fixed and to find a way to fix it.

- **Embrace Big Challenges:** Tackling significant problems can lead to clearer insights and more effective inventions.

## Diving Problem

The zig-zag path made on our way to the solution. The pre-existing condition for the problem is only the existence of water. Therefore the answer is not clear. We take a step back from water to anti-water (gas, air). It seemed the problem became more complicated. The next step is very important: Combine water and anti-water (water and air, hard and soft, rigid and flexible, hot and cold). It can be done, in a time or a space frame.
