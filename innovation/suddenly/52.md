The evolution of technical system is subject to the general laws of evolution. The knowledge of these laws allows you to develop the methods and tools for solving inventive tasks. There are three groups of that we have seen so far:

1. Various tricks (i.e., Do it in advance)
2. The methods based on utilizing physical effects and phenomena (i.e., Changing the state of physical properties of substances)
3. Complex methods that include tricks and physics (i.e., Building F-Fields)

Very often, during the problem solving process, one uses a trick first, and then physics. Success comes with applying both methods. Therefore, the application of physics during the problem solving process is one of the major areas in the Theory of Inventiveness.

## Self-Service

**Method #13: Self-Service**

**Overview:**

Method #13, known as **Self-Service**, is a principle within the TRIZ methodology. This method involves designing or modifying a system so that it performs necessary functions on itself, eliminating the need for external intervention or additional components. By leveraging the system's inherent properties or resources, self-service enhances efficiency, reduces complexity, and can lead to innovative solutions.

**When to Apply Self-Service:**

- **Eliminating External Dependencies:** When a system relies on external agents or resources to perform a function, and you aim to reduce or eliminate this dependency.
- **Improving Reliability and Efficiency:** To enhance the system's reliability by reducing points of failure associated with external components or processes.
- **Simplifying Maintenance:** When you want to simplify maintenance procedures by enabling the system to service itself without manual intervention.
- **Innovating Design Solutions:** To find creative ways to solve problems by making the system inherently capable of addressing its own issues.

**Examples of Self-Service:**

1. **Self-Cleaning Ovens:**
   - **Application:** Ovens designed with a pyrolytic cleaning function, where the oven heats to a high temperature to burn off food residues, turning them into ash that can be easily wiped away.
   - **Benefit:** Eliminates the need for chemical cleaners or manual scrubbing.

2. **Automatic Lubrication Systems:**
   - **Application:** Machines equipped with built-in systems that periodically lubricate moving parts using stored lubricant.
   - **Benefit:** Reduces wear and tear, extends equipment life, and minimizes manual maintenance.

3. **Self-Healing Materials:**
   - **Application:** Materials that can repair cracks or damage on their own through chemical reactions initiated by the damage itself.
   - **Benefit:** Enhances durability and safety, particularly in structures or components where manual repair is challenging.

4. **Regenerative Braking in Electric Vehicles:**
   - **Application:** Vehicles that convert kinetic energy back into stored energy in the battery during braking.
   - **Benefit:** Improves energy efficiency by utilizing the vehicle's own motion to recharge.

**Steps to Apply Method #13:**

1. **Identify External Dependencies:**
   - Examine the system to find functions currently performed by external agents or requiring external resources.

2. **Analyze System Capabilities:**
   - Determine if the system possesses inherent properties or components that could perform these functions.

3. **Conceptualize Self-Service Mechanisms:**
   - Devise ways to modify the system so it can utilize its own resources to fulfill the required functions.

4. **Evaluate Feasibility:**
   - Assess the practicality, cost-effectiveness, and potential benefits or drawbacks of the self-service solution.

5. **Implement and Test:**
   - Modify the system accordingly and conduct tests to ensure the self-service function operates as intended.

**Benefits of Self-Service:**

- **Increased Autonomy:** Systems become more independent and capable of managing their own operations.
- **Cost Savings:** Reduces expenses associated with external resources, maintenance, or downtime.
- **Enhanced Performance:** Improves system efficiency by streamlining processes and reducing delays.
- **Innovation:** Encourages creative problem-solving and can lead to breakthroughs in system design.

Method #13: Self-Service is a powerful tool in the TRIZ methodology for creating innovative solutions that enhance system performance and reliability. By enabling a system to perform functions on itself, designers and engineers can eliminate dependencies, simplify operations, and drive advancements in technology.
