#triz what are the main principles of TRIZ according to Genrich Altshuller?

## Main Principles of TRIZ

Genrich Altshuller identified several main principles of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) that form the basis for creative problem-solving and innovation. Some of the key principles include:

1. Contradictions: Identifying and resolving contradictions in a problem situation to find innovative solutions.

2. Ideality: Striving for the ideal state of a system where it performs its function perfectly without any drawbacks.

3. Laws of Evolution: Understanding the trends and patterns of evolution in systems and using them to predict and guide innovation.

4. Levels of Abstraction: Analyzing a problem at different levels of abstraction to uncover hidden patterns and mechanisms.

5. Resources: Leveraging existing resources and constraints in creative ways to overcome obstacles and generate new ideas.

6. Technical Contradictions: Resolving technical contradictions by finding inventive solutions that eliminate trade-offs between conflicting parameters.

7. Physical Contradictions: Solving physical contradictions by separating conflicting requirements and finding ways to fulfill them independently.

These principles help individuals and organizations approach problems in a systematic and structured manner, leading to more effective and innovative solutions.

#triz Explain how the electric bulb problem was solved in the And Suddenly the Inventor Appeared book.

## The Electric Bulb Problem

In the book "And Suddenly the Inventor Appeared," the electric bulb problem illustrates how to apply TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) principles to resolve a contradiction in manufacturing.

**The Problem:**

A factory producing electric light bulbs is facing customer complaints about the quality of their bulbs. The director suspects that the issue lies with the internal gas pressure within the bulbs. To ensure quality control, they need to measure the pressure inside each bulb. However, measuring the internal pressure directly requires breaking the bulb, which is counterproductive since it destroys the product they are trying to sell.

**The Contradiction:**

- **Technical Contradiction:** They need to measure the internal pressure to ensure quality (requirement), but measuring it by breaking the bulb destroys the product (undesirable effect).

**The Solution:**

Using TRIZ principles, specifically the concept of resolving contradictions without compromise, the inventive solution is to measure the internal pressure indirectly without breaking the bulb. The proposed method is to use **acoustic resonance testing**:

1. **Acoustic Testing:** Each bulb is gently tapped, and the sound it emits is analyzed. The frequency of the sound varies depending on the internal gas pressure of the bulb.

2. **Calibration:** Bulbs with known correct pressure levels are used to establish a reference for the sound frequencies associated with acceptable and unacceptable pressure levels.

3. **Non-Destructive Measurement:** By comparing the sound emitted by each bulb to the reference frequencies, workers can determine whether a bulb meets the quality standards without harming it.

**Outcome:**

This solution allows the factory to perform quality control on every bulb efficiently and cost-effectively without destroying the product. It resolves the contradiction by enabling measurement of an internal parameter (gas pressure) through an external characteristic (sound frequency), exemplifying inventive problem-solving as advocated by TRIZ.

**Key TRIZ Concepts Applied:**

- **Principle of Measurement:** Using indirect methods to measure a property.
- **Principle of Dynamics:** Allowing the object to adapt or respond dynamically (the bulb emits a sound when tapped).
- **Utilizing Physical Effects:** Leveraging physical phenomena (acoustics) to solve a problem.

By applying these principles, the factory enhances product quality and customer satisfaction while maintaining production efficiency.
