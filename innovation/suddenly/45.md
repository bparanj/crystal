How to convert a sentence in English language that describe a problem to the S-Field analysis language?

Converting a problem described in English into S-Field (Substance-Field) analysis language involves several systematic steps. S-Field analysis is a method within TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) that models technical problems using substances and fields to facilitate innovative solutions [Triz the Right Solution at the Right Time A Guide to Innovative Problem Solving - Yuri Salamatov.pdf].

**Steps to Convert a Problem Sentence into S-Field Analysis Language:**

1. **Identify the Substances (S1 and S2):**

   - **S1 (Object Substance):** Determine the primary substance or object that is experiencing the problem or requires improvement.
   - **S2 (Tool Substance):** Identify the substance or tool that is acting upon S1, causing the problem, or that could be utilized to address the problem.

2. **Determine the Field (F):**

   - **Field (F):** Recognize the type of energy or interaction present between S1 and S2. This could be mechanical, thermal, electromagnetic, chemical, etc. [Triz the Right Solution at the Right Time A Guide to Innovative Problem Solving - Yuri Salamatov.pdf].

3. **Construct the S-Field Model:**

   - Represent the relationship between the substances and the field using the S-Field notation:
     ```
     S2 ──F──> S1
     ```
     This indicates that substance S2 acts upon substance S1 through field F.

4. **Analyze the S-Field Model:**

   - **Completeness Check:** Verify if the S-Field is complete (contains two substances and a field).
   - **Functionality Assessment:** Determine if the interaction is effective or if there are any harmful or insufficient effects.
   - **Identify Deficiencies:** Look for missing elements or areas where the substances or field need modification.

5. **Apply TRIZ Standard Solutions:**

   - Utilize TRIZ methods to improve or complete the S-Field model.
   - This may involve:
     - Adding or modifying substances (introducing S3 if necessary).
     - Changing the type of field to eliminate negative effects.
     - Enhancing the interaction to fulfill the desired function.

**Example Conversion:**

*Problem Sentence in English:*

*"The adhesive fails to bond the two surfaces securely under high-temperature conditions."*

**Conversion to S-Field Analysis Language:**

1. **Identify the Substances:**

   - **S1 (Object Substance):** Two surfaces needing bonding.
   - **S2 (Tool Substance):** Adhesive used for bonding.

2. **Determine the Field:**

   - **F:** Chemical field (the chemical interaction facilitating the bond).

3. **Construct the S-Field Model:**

   ```
   Adhesive (S2) ──Chemical Field (F)──> Surfaces (S1)
   ```

4. **Analyze the S-Field Model:**

   - The chemical field is ineffective under high temperatures; the bond fails.
   - The S-Field exists but does not perform the required function adequately.

5. **Apply TRIZ Standard Solutions:**

   - **Modify Substance S2:** Use a heat-resistant adhesive that maintains its bonding properties at high temperatures.
   - **Introduce Substance S3:** Add a reinforcing agent or primer that enhances the adhesive's performance under heat [Inventive Thinking through TRIZ A Practical Guide, Second Edition (Michael A. Orloff.pdf)].
   - **Modify the Field F:** Incorporate a different field, such as a mechanical fastening method (e.g., rivets or clamps), to supplement the chemical bond.

   **Revised S-Field Model with Modification:**

   ```
   Heat-Resistant Adhesive (Modified S2) ──Chemical Field (F)──> Surfaces (S1)
   ```

   Or, with an added substance:

   ```
   Reinforcing Agent (S3)
       │
   Adhesive (S2) ──Chemical Field (F)──> Surfaces (S1)
   ```

By following these steps, you systematically translate an English problem statement into the S-Field model. This structured approach helps in identifying the core components of the problem and facilitates the application of TRIZ principles to develop innovative solutions.

**Benefits of Using S-Field Analysis:**

- **Clarity:** Simplifies complex problems by breaking them down into fundamental elements.
- **Innovation:** Encourages creative thinking by exploring different substances and fields to address the problem.
- **Efficiency:** Provides a clear pathway to identify and eliminate inefficiencies or harmful interactions within the system.

- Ensure all components of the S-Field are accurately identified.
- Consider modifying existing substances or fields before introducing new ones.
- Utilize TRIZ standard inventive solutions to guide the problem-solving process.

By mastering the conversion of problem statements into S-Field analysis language, you enhance your ability to tackle a wide range of technical challenges effectively.

## Prompt

How to design a prompt that will convert a sentence in English to S-Field analysis language?

Designing a prompt to convert an English sentence describing a problem into S-Field analysis language involves clearly instructing the process and steps the responder should follow. Here's how you can create such a prompt:

---

**Prompt Template:**

*Please convert the following English sentence, which describes a technical problem, into S-Field (Substance-Field) analysis language by following these steps:*

1. **Identify the Substances:**
   - **Substance S1 (Object Substance):** Determine the primary substance or object that is experiencing the problem or requires improvement.
   - **Substance S2 (Tool Substance):** Identify the substance or tool that is acting upon S1, causing the problem, or that could be used to address the problem.

2. **Determine the Field (F):**
   - Identify the type of energy or interaction present between S1 and S2 (e.g., mechanical, thermal, electromagnetic, chemical).

3. **Construct the S-Field Model:**
   - Represent the interaction using S-Field notation:
     ```
     S2 ──(Field F)──> S1
     ```
     - Explain how S2 acts upon S1 through Field F.
