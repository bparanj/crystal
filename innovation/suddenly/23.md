## Thick and Thin

To solve the problem of the thin glass sheets breaking during machining, we need to address the **physical contradiction**: the glass needs to be both **thick** (to withstand the machining process without breaking) and **thin** (to meet the final specification of 1 mm thickness).

**Solution:**

1. **Temporarily Increase the Thickness During Machining:**

   - **Laminate Multiple Glass Sheets:**
     - **Process:**
       - **Stack** multiple thin glass sheets together to form a thicker composite sheet.
       - **Bond** them temporarily using a soluble adhesive or by clamping them tightly.
     - **Machining:**
       - Cut and grind the thicker, more robust composite sheet into the required oval shape.
       - The increased thickness provides additional strength, reducing the risk of breakage.
     - **After Machining:**
       - **Separate** the individual glass sheets by dissolving the adhesive or unclamping.
       - Each sheet retains the required 1 mm thickness and the desired shape.

   - **Apply a Temporary Support Backing:**
     - **Process:**
       - **Attach** a rigid backing material (e.g., a thicker piece of glass, plastic, or metal) to the thin glass sheet using a removable adhesive.
     - **Machining:**
       - Perform the cutting and grinding with the support backing in place.
       - The backing absorbs stresses and vibrations, preventing the thin glass from breaking.
     - **After Machining:**
       - **Remove** the backing material carefully.
       - The thin glass sheet remains intact, shaped as required.

2. **Use of Protective Coatings:**

   - **Apply a Protective Film or Coating:**
     - **Process:**
       - Cover the glass sheet with a protective film that adds temporary thickness and strength.
     - **Machining:**
       - Cut and grind the glass with the protective layer in place.
     - **After Machining:**
       - **Strip** away the protective film.
       - The glass sheet is left at the specified 1 mm thickness.

3. **Adjust Machining Techniques:**

   - **Use Waterjet Cutting or Laser Cutting:**
     - These methods exert less mechanical stress on the glass compared to traditional grinding, reducing the risk of breakage even with thin sheets.

- **Separation in Time:**
  - **During Machining:** The glass is made effectively thicker (through lamination, backing, or coating) to prevent breakage.
  - **After Machining:** The glass returns to its original thin state (1 mm thickness) by removing the temporary thickness enhancements.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Reduced Breakage:** Increased strength during the machining process minimizes losses due to breakage.
  - **Cost-Effective:** Avoids the need to alter the customer's specifications or invest in entirely new equipment.
  - **Meets Specifications:** Delivers glass sheets that conform precisely to the required thickness and shape.

By temporarily increasing the glass's effective thickness during the machining process and then returning it to the desired thinness afterward, we resolve the physical contradiction. This approach allows the glass to be both **thick when needed** (to withstand machining) and **thin as required** (to meet the customer's order). Implementing this solution enhances production efficiency and fulfills the order without excessive breakage.
