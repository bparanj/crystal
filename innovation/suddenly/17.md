## To Make Water Softer

Once, a famous coach - a former champion diver - complained to his colleague: "It is difficult to work today. Dives are becoming more and more complicated. We have to think of new combinations, and try them. The problem is that the large number of unsuccessful landings has increased diver injuries. The water is not so soft when you fall from a tall tower. Sometimes I feel that a diver could make new dives, but often is afraid to get injured and not able to enter the competition."

"There is nothing we can do," his colleague said. "This is the nature of the sport we are committed to. There are injuries in my team as well during unsuccessful dives."

And suddenly the Inventor appeared.

"There will be no more injuries. We will make the water softer. What we have to do is..."

What do you think we have to do with the water to make it softer and eliminate injuries during dives?

To make the water softer and eliminate injuries during dives, we can introduce air bubbles into the water to reduce its density and increase its compressibility. By aerating the water at the point where divers enter, we create a mixture of water and air that forms a cushioning layer. This layer absorbs the impact more effectively than plain water, making the landing safer even during unsuccessful dives.

By controlling the properties of the water in the operative zone and time, we can alter its density temporarily to provide a softer landing. This method reduces the risk of injuries without altering the fundamental nature of the sport.
