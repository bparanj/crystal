## Separation in Time or Space

Method #6: Conflicting requirements are separated in time or in space. Do you remember the problem about the welded pipes? The steel ribbon was cut partially in some areas and was not cut in other areas. There is a trickier way to superimpose that which is not superimposable: Give one characteristic to the whole object, and the opposite characteristic to its parts. At first, it seems that this is impossible. Indeed, how can you build a white tower out of black bricks?

**Method #6: Separation of Conflicting Requirements in Time or Space**

In the context of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), **Method #6** addresses situations where a system faces conflicting requirements that cannot be satisfied simultaneously in the same place or time. This method proposes resolving such conflicts by separating the opposing requirements either in **time** or in **space**.

**1. Separation in Space:**

- **Concept:** Assign conflicting properties to different parts of a system or object.
- **Application:** Different areas or components exhibit different characteristics to fulfill specific functions.

**Example: The Welded Pipes Problem**

- **Problem:** Manufacturing welded steel pipes required the steel ribbon to have conflicting properties:
  - **For Welding:** The edges needed to be cleanly cut to allow for effective welding.
  - **For Strength:** The ribbon needed to remain uncut in other areas to maintain structural integrity.
- **Solution:** The steel ribbon was **partially cut in some areas** (to facilitate welding) and **left uncut in other areas** (to preserve strength).
- **Result:** By separating the cutting in space, the ribbon met both requirements without compromising either.

**2. Separation in Time:**

- **Concept:** Allow a system or component to change its properties over time to meet different requirements at different moments.
- **Application:** The same part can exhibit one property at one time and the opposite property at another.

*An example (not from the original text)*:

- **Self-Tinting Glasses:**
  - **Indoors:** The lenses are clear.
  - **Outdoors:** The lenses darken in sunlight.
- **Result:** The glasses provide optimal vision and comfort by changing properties over time.

**Superimposing Opposite Characteristics:**

**"Give one characteristic to the whole object, and the opposite characteristic to its parts."**

At first glance, this idea seems impossible. How can an object as a whole have one property while its individual parts have the opposite? Here's how this concept works:

**Example: Building a White Tower Out of Black Bricks**

- **Challenge:** Construct a tower that appears white using only black bricks.
- **Solution:**
  - **Arrangement and Design:**
    - **Surface Treatment:** Paint the outward-facing surfaces of the assembled tower white, while the individual bricks remain black inside.
    - **Light Effects:** Use lighting or reflective materials so that the tower appears white when viewed from a distance.
  - **Perception:** The overall appearance of the tower is white, even though the individual components are black.
- **Explanation:** The **whole object** (the tower) exhibits the property of being white, while the **parts** (the bricks) possess the opposite property of being black.

**Applying the Concept in Problem Solving:**

- **Composite Materials:**
  - **Example:** Creating a lightweight yet strong material by combining heavy, strong fibers (carbon fibers) with a light, weak matrix (resin). The **material as a whole** is lightweight, while the **fibers** provide strength.

- **Flexible Structures from Rigid Components:**
  - **Example:** A chain is made of rigid links but is flexible as a whole. The **individual parts** are rigid, but the **entire assembly** is flexible.

- **Transparency from Opaque Elements:**
  - **Example:** A screen made of opaque strips with gaps in between can allow light to pass through, making the **overall structure** appear translucent, even though the **components** are opaque.

**Takeaways:**

- **Method #6** encourages solving problems by rethinking how conflicting requirements can be met by distributing them across different times or spaces.
- **Assigning Opposite Properties:** By cleverly designing systems where the whole has one property and the parts have the opposite, it's possible to fulfill conflicting needs.
- **Creative Thinking:** This method pushes us to look beyond conventional solutions and consider how changing perspectives can lead to innovative outcomes.

---

**Conclusion:**

Using **Method #6**, we can tackle seemingly impossible problems by separating conflicting requirements in time or space, or by assigning opposite properties to the whole and its parts. This approach enables us to design solutions that satisfy all requirements without compromise, leading to inventive and effective problem-solving.
