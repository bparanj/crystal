In TRIZ , inventive principles are tools designed to help overcome contradictions and develop creative solutions to complex problems. Two of these principles are:

1. **Principle 13: "Do It Inversely"** - This principle involves inverting the action or method to achieve the desired outcome, often by doing the opposite of what is traditionally done.
2. **Principle 35: "Change the State of the Physical Property"** - This principle focuses on altering the physical state or conditions of an object or system to solve a problem, such as changing from solid to liquid, altering temperature, or modifying other physical properties.

**Application of Both Principles to Solve a Problem:**

**Problem Scenario:**
A pharmaceutical company is facing challenges in delivering a specific drug effectively to target cancer cells without harming healthy cells. Traditional drug delivery methods lead to side effects because the drug affects both healthy and cancerous cells equally. The company needs a solution that allows the drug to specifically target cancer cells, reducing side effects and increasing treatment efficacy.

**Applying Principle 13: "Do It Inversely":**
Instead of the conventional approach where the drug circulates throughout the body to find and kill cancer cells (which also affects healthy cells), we invert the problem: What if the cancer cells actively attract and absorb the drug themselves? By reversing the interaction, we can design a system where cancer cells specifically uptake the drug.

**Applying Principle 35: "Change the State of the Physical Property":**
To achieve targeted delivery, we can alter the physical properties of the drug or its carrier. One method is to encapsulate the drug within nanoparticles that are activated or change state under certain conditions unique to cancer cells (e.g., pH level, temperature, or specific enzymes). For instance, cancerous tissues often have a slightly more acidic environment compared to normal tissues.

**Integrated Solution:**
- **Design pH-Sensitive Nanoparticles:** Develop drug-loaded nanoparticles that remain stable in the neutral pH of healthy tissues but become unstable and release the drug in the acidic environment of cancer cells.
- **Targeted Activation:** The nanoparticles exploit the inverted approach by relying on the cancer cell's own environment to trigger drug release, effectively making the cancer cells initiate their own treatment.
- **Change in Physical State:** The nanoparticles change their state (e.g., from solid to gel or by disintegrating) in response to the pH change, releasing the drug precisely where it's needed.

**Outcome:**
By combining both principles, the company creates a targeted drug delivery system that minimizes side effects and maximizes efficacy. The drug is only released in the vicinity of cancer cells, preserving healthy cells and improving patient outcomes.

**Explanation:**

- **Inversion of Action:** Traditional drug delivery passively exposes all cells to the drug. By inverting this process, the drug remains inactive until it reaches the target environment, effectively flipping the conventional method.
- **Changing Physical Properties:** The nanoparticles exploit changes in physical properties (response to pH levels) to control the drug release mechanism, directly applying Principle 35.

**Real-World Example: The Development of Smart Insulin**

*Problem:*
Patients with diabetes must constantly monitor their blood sugar levels and administer insulin injections, risking hypo- or hyperglycemia due to delays or inaccuracies in dosing.

*Applying "Do It Inversely":*
Instead of patients actively monitoring and administering insulin, invert the process so that insulin is released automatically in response to blood glucose levels.

*Applying "Change the State of the Physical Property":*
Develop insulin formulations that change their physical state or activity in response to glucose concentration. For example, insulin bound to a gel that dissolves when glucose levels are high.

*Solution:*
- **Glucose-Responsive Insulin Delivery Systems:** Create insulin formulations that remain inactive until they detect high glucose levels, at which point they change their state to release insulin.
- **Mechanism:** Utilize materials that swell or dissolve in response to glucose, triggering insulin release only when needed.
- **Benefits:** Provides automatic, responsive insulin delivery, reducing the need for constant monitoring and preventing dangerous glucose level fluctuations.



By employing the TRIZ principles of "Do It Inversely" and "Change the State of the Physical Property," innovative solutions can be developed to address complex problems. In both examples, inverting traditional processes and altering physical states lead to targeted, efficient, and effective outcomes that significantly improve upon conventional methods.
