## How to Get Out of a Dead End

The Inventor offered a solution to prevent the steel plates from being damaged by the harmful effects of air when heated above 800°C. He suggested **heating the plates to the required 1200°C temperature in an environment where the air cannot harm them**.

This can be achieved by:

- **Using a Protective Atmosphere:**
  - **Inert Gas Environment:** Heat the plates in a chamber filled with an inert gas like argon or nitrogen. These gases do not react with the steel even at high temperatures, preventing oxidation or surface damage.
  - **Vacuum Heating:** Place the plates in a vacuum furnace where air (and thus oxygen) is removed, eliminating the possibility of harmful reactions with the steel surface.

By **eliminating the presence of reactive air during the heating process**, the steel plates can safely reach 1200°C without any surface damage. This allows the forming process under the press to proceed effectively, producing components with the desired properties and quality.

**Explanation:**

- **Resolving the Contradiction:** The problem presents a contradiction where the plates need to be heated to a high temperature for forming but cannot be exposed to air at that temperature without damage.
- **Innovative Solution:** By altering the environment in which heating occurs, the Inventor removes the harmful effect of air without changing the required heating temperature or the properties of the steel.
- **Outcome:** The plates are heated to 1200°C in a protective environment, preventing damage and allowing successful forming.

This solution demonstrates how changing the conditions around the problematic process—in this case, removing air or preventing its interaction with the heated steel—can resolve a seemingly dead-end situation and fulfill both requirements.
