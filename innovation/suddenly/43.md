Rule #1 in S-Field Analysis states that to solve a problem involving a partial S-Field, the S-Field must be completed. A partial S-Field is a system where one or more components of the Substance-Field model are missing or insufficient. The Substance-Field (S-Field) model is a fundamental concept in TRIZ that represents the minimal working unit of a technical system, consisting of two substances (S1 and S2) and a field (F) that facilitates interaction between them.

**Method #12: Completing the S-Field**

To address a problem with a partial S-Field:

1. **Identify the Missing Element**: Determine whether a substance or a field is missing or inadequate in the system.

2. **Introduce the Necessary Component**:
   - **Adding a Substance**: If only one substance is present, introduce a second substance that can interact with the first.
   - **Adding a Field**: If the interaction between substances is weak or nonexistent, introduce an appropriate field (e.g., mechanical, thermal, electromagnetic) to facilitate or enhance the interaction.

By completing the S-Field, the system becomes capable of performing the desired function effectively. This method ensures that all essential components are present and interacting properly, allowing for innovative solutions to technical problems.

For example, if a process involves heating a material (S1) but lacks an effective means to transfer heat, introducing a heating element (S2) and thermal energy (field F) completes the S-Field, enabling efficient heating of the material.
