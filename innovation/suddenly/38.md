To make a cartoon movie, it is necessary to make thousands of drawings. In every yard of movie film there are about 52 drawings. In a ten minute movie there are more than 15000 drawings! One movie studio decided to make a "contour" film. This is how it was done: On a flat surface the artist lays out a picture with colored string. The operator takes a shot, the artist moves the string, and the operator again takes another shot and so on. It is easier to move the string than to draw a new picture.

"That is too slow," said the operator.

"Yes, you are right, it is slow," said the artist making the corrections to the string. "In order to make a rabbit run across the screen we spend a whole working day!"

And suddenly the Inventor appeared.

"Wait, rabbit, I will get you," he said decisively.

What do you think the Inventor offered?

## Solution

The Inventor proposed automating the movement of the strings to accelerate the animation process. Instead of manually adjusting the strings for each frame—which is time-consuming—the Inventor suggested attaching the strings to a mechanical system that can move them automatically.

By incorporating devices like gears, pulleys, or motors, the strings could be manipulated precisely and quickly, creating the motion needed for the animation without the artist having to reposition them by hand every time. This mechanization transforms the static setup into a dynamic one, significantly reducing the time required to animate sequences like a rabbit running across the screen.

This idea aligns with the TRIZ principle of **Dynamicity**, which involves making an object or system more adaptable and capable of changing according to the requirements at each stage of operation. By increasing the degree of free motion and enabling the environment (in this case, the strings and animation setup) to change dynamically, the animation process becomes more efficient.

Additionally, the Inventor's solution embodies the principle of **Making the Movable Part Fixed and the Fixed Part Movable**. Instead of the artist (the movable part) constantly adjusting the strings (the fixed part), the mechanism allows the strings to move while the artist oversees the operation, thereby reversing their roles and enhancing productivity.

## AI Assisted Coding

Code generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) is similar to the problem of animating cartoons using strings in that both involve automating a manual, time-consuming process to enhance efficiency and productivity.

In the cartoon example, creating thousands of individual drawings is labor-intensive and slow. The Inventor proposes automating the movement of the strings to create the animation, reducing manual effort and speeding up the process.

Similarly, in software development, writing code manually can be tedious and resource-intensive. LLMs can generate code automatically based on input prompts, effectively automating parts of the coding process. This reduces developers' workload, accelerates development cycles, and allows for rapid prototyping and iteration.

Both scenarios reflect the application of the **Law of Increasing Dynamization**, a principle from TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), which states that technical systems evolve toward greater flexibility and controllability [Simplified TRIZ New Problem Solving Applications for Technical and Business Professionals, 3rd Edition (Kalevi Rantanen, David W. Conley, Ellen R. Domb.pdf)]. Systems progress from rigid, manual processes to more dynamic and adaptable ones.

In the cartoon problem, the static process of manual drawing evolves into a dynamic system where movements are automated. In code generation, the rigid process of manual coding evolves into an interactive process with an AI that can generate and adapt code dynamically.

Furthermore, both processes are moving toward the phase of **self-development of the system**, where the system assists in its own improvement without extensive external intervention. LLMs learn from vast amounts of data to generate code that meets users' needs, effectively participating in the development process.

By automating repetitive tasks, both scenarios allow humans to focus on higher-level creative and problem-solving activities, enhancing overall productivity and fostering innovation.
