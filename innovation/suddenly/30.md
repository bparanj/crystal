If the amoeba could speak, it would say: "My single-cell ancestors lived on the Earth billions of years ago. Now, everything consists of single-cell combinations. Wood for example is a combination of cells. A human being is also a combination of cells. This means that the Era of Cells is continuing!"

With all due respect to the single-cell speaker, we should object. Wood and human beings have different characteristics than single cells. The wood as well as the human being, are systems of cells. There is no longer an actual Era of Cells, there is an Era of Systems.

Growth of systems by development and complication is a universal law. In the technical world development goes from a cell to a system. An automobile is a cell, the automobile industry is a system. A telephone is a cell, the telephone industry is a system.

When a single cell becomes part of a system it performs more efficiently and develops faster. At the same time, the cell depends on the system and cannot exist without it.

Contemporary technology is a technology of systems. Its "cells" are different devices, machines and equipment. They function inside the system. Therefore, some people in the second part of the 20th century call this "The Century of Technical Systems."

There is a strict subordination inside a technical system. An electric bulb in a car is subordinated to the electrical system of the car. The car is subordinated to the car industry which includes millions of cars, roads, gas stations and repair stations.

Every technical system has a "superior" system above (supersystem) and a "subordinate" system below (subsystem). Any change in a hierarchical system affects both systems. A technical contradiction emerges because somebody forgets this law. One part of the system gets an advantage over its "superior" or "subordinate" system. Therefore it is necessary to consider the interests of not only the system that needs to be improved but also the interests of the subsystems and the supersystem.

## Let's Do it Without Telepathy

How can the driver know that it is time fill the tank without any telepathy?

The inventor offered to install a **low-fuel warning system** that would alert the driver when the gas level is getting low. This system could be a warning light, an audible alarm, or another noticeable signal that automatically notifies the driver without relying on them to constantly check the fuel gauge. By providing a clear and timely alert, the driver is reminded to refuel before running out of gas, effectively solving the problem without the need for telepathy. This solution enhances safety and convenience by ensuring the driver is aware of the fuel status and can take action accordingly.
