# TRIZ Application: Solving the Problem of Making Accurate Holes in a Flexible Rubber Hose

---

**Problem Description:**

*There is a need to make many holes 1 mm in diameter in a rubber hose. While it's not hard to punch or drill holes of that size, the challenge arises because the hose is very flexible. It stretches, compresses, and bends, making it complicated to make the holes accurately. The supervisor tried burning the holes with a heated iron rod, but the edges of these holes were uneven and brittle.*

*"Nothing can be done! How annoying!" exclaimed the supervisor, almost crying.*

*And suddenly the Inventor appeared.*

*"Do not cry!" he said. "It is very simple! Here is an English Patent No. 1268562 where the inventor offered..."*

**Question:**

*What was in this patent? Think about it.*

## **Applying TRIZ Principles:**

To solve this problem, we can apply two TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) principles:

1. **Principle 35: "Change the State of the Physical Property"**

2. **Principle 13: "Do It Inversely"**

---

### **1. Principle 35: "Change the State of the Physical Property"**

**Challenge:**

- The rubber hose is too flexible, making precise hole-making difficult.
- Flexibility causes the hose to stretch, compress, and bend during drilling, leading to inaccurate holes.

**Solution Approach:**

- **Alter the Hose's Physical State:** Change the hose from flexible to rigid temporarily.
- **Methods to Change Flexibility:**
  - Cooling the hose to make it rigid.
  - Filling the hose with a material that solidifies.

---

### **2. Principle 13: "Do It Inversely"**

**Challenge:**

- Conventional methods aren’t effective due to the hose's flexibility.

**Solution Approach:**

- **Invert the Process:**
  - Instead of drilling holes in a flexible hose, first make the hose rigid.
  - Alternatively, create the holes before the hose becomes flexible.

## **Solution Proposed in Patent No. 1268562:**

**The Inventor Proposed to Fill the Hose with Water and Freeze It**

---

### **Implementation Steps:**

**1. Fill the Hose with Water:**

- Completely fill the rubber hose with water to avoid air pockets.
- Ensure the hose is sealed at both ends to contain the water.

**2. Freeze the Hose:**

- Place the water-filled hose in a freezing environment (e.g., a freezer).
- Allow sufficient time for the water inside the hose to freeze solid.
- **Result:** The frozen water expands slightly and makes the hose rigid.

**3. Drill or Punch the Holes:**

- With the hose now rigid, proceed to drill or punch 1 mm diameter holes.
- The rigidity prevents the hose from flexing, ensuring precise and clean holes.
- The internal ice supports the hose walls during drilling.

**4. Thaw the Hose:**

- After making the holes, let the hose return to room temperature.
- The ice melts back into liquid water.

**5. Empty the Hose:**

- Drain the water from the hose.
- Dry the hose thoroughly if necessary.

**6. Final Result:**

- The hose returns to its original flexible state.
- It now has accurately placed holes with clean edges.

## **Explanation of TRIZ Principles in Action:**

### **"Change the State of the Physical Property":**

- **From Flexible to Rigid:**
  - Freezing the water inside the hose changes the hose's physical property from flexible to rigid.
  - This temporary change allows for precise machining that isn’t possible when the hose is flexible.

- **Reversibility:**
  - After drilling, the hose returns to flexibility once thawed.
  - No permanent alteration of the hose material occurs.

### **"Do It Inversely":**

- **Invert the Problem:**
  - Instead of trying to work with the hose's flexibility, we eliminate it temporarily.
  - By making the hose rigid first, we reverse the usual order of operation.

## **Alternative Solutions Applying the Same Principles:**

### **A. Using Low-Temperature Cooling (Cryogenic Freezing):**

- **Process:**
  - Cool the hose using liquid nitrogen or dry ice.
  - The rubber becomes rigid at low temperatures.

- **Advantages:**
  - Rapid cooling and solidification.
  - Effective for industrial-scale operations.

- **Considerations:**
  - Requires handling of cryogenic materials safely.
  - Rubber properties must withstand low temperatures without damage.

### **B. Filling the Hose with Sand or Salt:**

- **Process:**
  - Fill the hose tightly with fine sand or salt to provide internal support.
  - Proceed to drill the holes.
  - After drilling, remove the sand or dissolve the salt with water.

- **Application of TRIZ Principles:**
  - **Change of Physical State:** Solid filler changes the flexibility of the hose.
  - **Do It Inversely:** Instead of working against flexibility, we eliminate it.

### **C. Inserting a Mandrel or Rod Inside the Hose:**

- **Process:**
  - Insert a tightly fitting metal or plastic rod (mandrel) into the hose.
  - Drill the holes through both the hose and slightly into the mandrel.
  - Remove the mandrel after drilling.

- **Advantages:**
  - Provides a solid backing for precise hole-making.
  - Reusable mandrels reduce material costs.

- **Application of TRIZ Principles:**
  - **Change of Physical State:** The hose becomes effectively rigid with the mandrel.
  - **Do It Inversely:** Modify the hose's condition before processing.

## **Benefits of the Solution:**

- **Precision and Accuracy:**
  - Rigid hose allows for accurate placement and size of holes.
  - Clean edges without brittleness common with burning methods.

- **Preservation of Hose Integrity:**
  - No damage to the hose material since it's a temporary state change.
  - Avoids degradation of rubber properties.

- **Cost-Effectiveness:**
  - Utilizes readily available materials (water and freezing conditions).
  - Reduces waste and rework due to inaccurate holes.

- **Scalability:**
  - The method can be applied to hoses of various lengths and diameters.
  - Suitable for both small-scale and large-scale production.

## **Conclusion:**

By applying the TRIZ principles of "Change the State of the Physical Property" and "Do It Inversely," we effectively solve the challenge of making precise holes in a flexible rubber hose. Temporarily transforming the hose into a rigid state allows for accurate drilling or punching of holes. After the process, the hose returns to its original flexible state, meeting the desired specifications without compromising its structural integrity.

## **Final Thoughts:**

- **Innovation Through TRIZ:**
  - This solution illustrates how creative application of TRIZ principles can overcome practical manufacturing obstacles.
  - It encourages thinking beyond conventional methods to find efficient and effective solutions.

- **Applicability to Other Fields:**
  - The approach can be adapted to other situations where flexible materials need precise machining.
  - Understanding and manipulating physical properties unlocks new possibilities in problem-solving.
