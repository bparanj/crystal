## Reliable Indicator

A very reliable indicator to evaluate your idea is whether it removes contradictions. In the context of TRIZ, a good inventive idea effectively resolves contradictions within a problem.

- **Contradictions** occur when improving one part of a system negatively affects another part.
- **Removing contradictions** leads to innovative solutions that enhance the system without causing new issues.

According to TRIZ, an inventive solution is most effective when it overcomes these contradictions, ensuring that improvements do not impair other parts of the system. This approach is a key indicator of a strong and innovative idea.

## One as Good as Many

In a laboratory, a device was built to study the movement of droplets of liquid fertilizer to be sprayed from an aircraft. Air rushed through a pipe carrying millions of droplets; however, this device produced only very small droplets.

During the experiment, it was found that droplets of larger sizes needed to be tested as well.

- One engineer suggested: **"Let's purchase several devices."**
- Another engineer contradicted: **"It will take more time than we have. Besides, it is too expensive. Twenty tests will require twenty different sprayers."**

Then, the Inventor suddenly appeared and said:

**"One sprayer will work as well as many different sprayers. The dimensions of the droplets could be changed if..."**

He explained what should be done.

**Question:** *What do you think?*

**Possible Solution Using TRIZ Principles:**

The problem is finding a way to produce droplets of various sizes using a single sprayer, avoiding the need to purchase multiple devices.

**Applying TRIZ Principle 15: Dynamics**

- **Dynamics:** Allow or design characteristics of a system to change to be optimal under varying conditions. This involves making a system adjustable or capable of changing its properties to meet different needs.

**Proposed Solution:**

- **Adjustable Sprayer Design:**
  - **Variable Nozzle Size:** Modify the sprayer so that the nozzle size can be adjusted. By changing the diameter of the nozzle, the size of the droplets can be controlled.
  - **Adjustable Air Pressure:** Implement a mechanism to vary the air pressure or flow rate. Higher pressure might produce smaller droplets, while lower pressure allows for larger droplets.
  - **Interchangeable Components:** Design the sprayer with interchangeable parts (e.g., nozzles of different sizes) that can be easily swapped to alter droplet size.
  - **Fluid Properties Adjustment:** Alter the viscosity of the liquid fertilizer by adjusting its concentration or temperature, affecting droplet formation.

By incorporating adjustability into the sprayer, the laboratory can use one device to produce droplets of different sizes, fulfilling the experimental requirements without incurring the cost and time of purchasing multiple sprayers.

**Conclusion:**

The Inventor likely suggested modifying the existing sprayer to make it adaptable for producing various droplet sizes. This approach aligns with TRIZ principles by resolving the contradiction of needing multiple devices versus limited time and resources.

Implementing an adjustable sprayer seems to address the problem effectively. It allows the laboratory to conduct all necessary tests with different droplet sizes using a single device, saving both time and money.

To address the need for testing droplets of larger sizes without purchasing multiple sprayers, the Inventor suggested modifying the existing sprayer to make it adjustable. By enabling the sprayer to produce droplets of varying sizes, the laboratory can perform all necessary tests using one device, saving both time and resources.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Adjustable Nozzle Size:**
   - **Variable Aperture:** Implement a mechanism that allows the nozzle opening to be adjusted. By increasing or decreasing the size of the nozzle, the sprayer can control the size of the droplets produced.
   - **Interchangeable Nozzles:** Design the sprayer with a set of interchangeable nozzles of different sizes. Switching between them can easily alter droplet dimensions.

2. **Control of Airflow and Pressure:**
   - **Variable Air Pressure:** Incorporate a regulator to adjust the air pressure or airflow rate. Higher pressure can produce smaller droplets, while lower pressure allows for larger droplets.
   - **Pulse Modulation:** Use pulsed air streams to influence droplet formation and size.

3. **Adjusting Liquid Properties:**
   - **Alter Viscosity:** Modify the viscosity of the liquid fertilizer by adding thickeners or diluents. A more viscous fluid tends to form larger droplets.
   - **Temperature Control:** Adjust the temperature of the liquid to change its physical properties, affecting droplet size.

4. **Mechanical Vibration:**
   - **Ultrasonic Vibrations:** Add a component that imparts vibrations to the nozzle or liquid. Changing the vibration frequency can influence droplet size.

**Underlying Principle:**

The Inventor's solution is based on the concept of making the system **dynamic and adaptable**. By introducing adjustability, the sprayer becomes versatile, capable of meeting various testing requirements without the need for multiple devices.

This approach aligns with the idea of designing equipment that can **change its characteristics** to suit different needs, effectively solving the problem with innovation and efficiency.

**Benefits:**

- **Cost Efficiency:** Eliminates the expense of purchasing multiple sprayers.
- **Time Saving:** Reduces the time required to set up and switch between different devices.
- **Flexibility:** Allows for quick adjustments to droplet sizes as experimental parameters change.
- **Resource Optimization:** Makes optimal use of existing equipment.

**Conclusion:**

By modifying the existing sprayer to adjust droplet sizes, the laboratory can efficiently conduct the necessary experiments. This inventive solution demonstrates how adapting a single device to perform multiple functions can overcome limitations related to cost and time constraints.
