A toy factory had a customer ask for a flying doll called Carlson, but they didn't have it in their store. Children were crying because they wanted it.

The engineer showed two samples: One looked like Carlson but couldn't fly. The other had a large propeller and could fly like a helicopter, but couldn't stand up and didn't look like Carlson - it looked like a windmill.

The director said it was bad that one doll looked right but couldn't fly, while the other could fly but looked wrong.

The engineer called it a technical contradiction. A small propeller wouldn't give enough power to fly. A big propeller would ruin the appearance and make it unstable.

Then the inventor appeared and said "Let's start from the physical contradiction. The prop should be big and should not be big. Everything is clear, we should use the method..."

What method is he talking about, and how can he use it?

## Solution

The inventor is referring to the **method of resolving physical contradictions using the TRIZ separation principles**. Specifically, he is suggesting a solution where the propeller is **both big and not big** by making it adjustable or changing its state under different conditions.

**How he can use it:**

- **Collapsible or Retractable Propeller:** Design the doll with a propeller that can expand to a larger size when needed for flying and retract to a smaller size when not in use. This way, the propeller is big enough to provide lift during flight but becomes small or practically invisible when the doll is on display, preserving its appearance.

- **Transparent Propeller Blades:** Use transparent materials for the propeller blades. The propeller remains large enough to enable flight but is less noticeable, maintaining the doll's aesthetic appeal.

- **Hidden Propulsion System:** Incorporate an alternative propulsion method, such as an internal fan or ducted air system, which doesn't require a visible large propeller. This allows the doll to fly without altering its appearance.

- **Separation in Time:** The propeller could be designed to only appear (extend) during flight and retract or hide when the doll is standing, resolving the contradiction by separating the conflicting requirements in time.

By applying these solutions, the physical contradiction of the propeller needing to be both big and not big is resolved, allowing the creation of a flying Carlson doll that both looks correct and functions properly.

## Software System

An equivalent example in a software system involves resolving a similar physical contradiction to meet conflicting user requirements.

**Scenario:**

A development team is creating a mobile app that features a floating action button (FAB) for quick access to a primary function, such as creating a new message or initiating a chat. Users want the FAB to be readily accessible (large and prominently placed) so they can easily tap it at any time. However, users also complain that the FAB obstructs content on the screen, especially on devices with smaller displays, detracting from the overall user experience.

The design team identifies a **technical contradiction**:

- **If** the FAB is large and always visible, **then** it is easy to access but obstructs underlying content.
- **If** the FAB is small or hidden, **then** it doesn't obstruct content but becomes harder to access quickly.

This leads to a **physical contradiction**:

- The FAB should be **large and always visible** to ensure ease of access.
- The FAB should be **small or not visible** to prevent obstructing content.

**Method for Resolving the Contradiction:**

Applying the **TRIZ separation principles** to resolve the physical contradictionâ€”specifically, **separation in time**, **separation in space**, and **separation upon condition**.

**Solutions:**

1. **Separation in Time:**

   - **Adaptive Visibility:** Implement the FAB so that it appears only when the user is likely to need it.
     - The FAB remains hidden while the user is actively scrolling or interacting with content.
     - It reappears when the user stops interacting or performs a specific gesture.
   - **Example:** The FAB fades out during content interaction and fades in when interaction ceases, ensuring it's large and accessible when needed but not obstructive during content viewing.

2. **Separation in Space:**

   - **Contextual Placement:** Position the FAB in an area of the screen that minimizes obstruction.
     - Use screen edges or corners where important content is less likely to be displayed.
   - **Collapsible Design:** Allow the FAB to collapse into a smaller icon or a sidebar when not in use.
     - When the user taps or swipes over it, the FAB expands to full size.

3. **Separation upon Condition:**

   - **User Preference Settings:**
     - Provide options for users to customize the size and visibility of the FAB based on their preferences.
     - Users who prioritize screen space can choose a smaller or hidden FAB, while others can keep it large.
   - **Intelligent Behavior:**
     - The app tracks user interaction patterns.
     - If the FAB is used frequently, it remains large; if not used often, it minimizes automatically.

4. **Using Alternative Interaction Methods:**

   - **Gesture Controls:**
     - Eliminate the need for a visible FAB by implementing gesture-based interactions.
     - For example, swiping up from the bottom edge or double-tapping an area of the screen to trigger the primary function.
   - **Voice Commands:**
     - Integrate voice control to activate the primary function without relying on a visual button.

**Explanation:**

By applying these solutions, the development team resolves the physical contradiction:

- The FAB is **large and accessible** when the user needs it.
- The FAB is **small or hidden** when the user is engaging with other content.

This approach ensures that the app remains user-friendly without compromising on usability or aesthetics, much like designing the flying doll with a propeller that is both big (for flight) and not big (for appearance and stability).

The application of TRIZ principles in software design allows developers to creatively solve contradictory requirements. By using methods such as separation in time, space, and condition, the team can deliver a solution that enhances user experience without sacrificing functionality. This mirrors the inventive approach taken to resolve the contradiction in the toy factory example, demonstrating the versatility of TRIZ in problem-solving across different fields.
