## Inventive Solution

An **inventive solution** must meet two essential requirements:

1. **Improve a specific part or characteristic of the system.**
   - This means making a positive change or enhancement to a particular component or feature of the system to achieve a desired outcome or solve a problem.

2. **Do so without impairing other parts or characteristics of the system or adjacent systems.**
   - The improvement should not cause negative effects on other components or features within the same system or on connected systems. It should avoid creating new problems while solving the existing one.

**In simple terms**, when we enhance one aspect of a system, we need to ensure that this improvement doesn't lead to issues elsewhere. The goal is to achieve progress in a targeted area without compromising the functionality, performance, or integrity of other parts of the system or related systems. This holistic approach ensures that the solution is truly beneficial and sustainable.
