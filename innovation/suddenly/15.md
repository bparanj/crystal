## Problem Domain to Solution Domain

When trying to solve complex problems, the **problem** and the **solution** often exist in different domains. It's challenging to jump directly from understanding the problem to finding the solution because they are not immediately connected.

To bridge this gap, we use **technical contradictions** and methods to resolve them. Think of these contradictions and methods as the **support columns of a bridge**. Just as a bridge needs support columns and a pathway to cross from one side to the other, we need a structured approach to move from the problem to the solution.

- **Support Columns (Contradictions and Methods):** These are the key points that hold up our pathway. Identifying contradictions in the problem helps us understand what's preventing a straightforward solution.

- **Top Panels (The Bridge Deck):** These represent the steps or strategies we use to move from one support column to the next. They allow us to walk step by step toward the solution.

We can't simply leap from the problem domain to the solution domain. Instead, we need to:

1. **Identify the Task:** Clearly understand the problem we're trying to solve.

2. **Find the Contradictions:** Determine the technical contradictions that make the problem challenging.

3. **Apply Methods to Resolve Contradictions:** Use specific strategies or principles designed to overcome these contradictions.

By following this step-by-step approach, we build an "invisible bridge" that carries our thoughts from the problem to new ideas and ultimately to an effective solution. This methodology ensures that we don't get lost trying to jump directly to solutions without addressing the underlying challenges.

The inventor must find and remove technical contradictions.
