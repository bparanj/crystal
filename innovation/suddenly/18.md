## Everlasting Paint

The president of a furniture company said to his engineer: "During the last year we sold one hundred sets of furniture to kindergartens. Unfortunately the customers are complaining that the kids have stripped or scratched the paint off the furniture!"

"This is not our problem!" said an offended engineer. "You can scratch the hardest of paints. This has nothing to do with us. Maybe they should buy unfinished furniture."

"No," said the president. "It is good to have colorful furniture in kindergartens. Perhaps we can find a paint that will penetrate deep inside the wood?"

"This is a fantasy!" laughed the engineer. "Thousands of times people have tried to impregnate wood with paint with very poor results. You know that."

And suddenly the Inventor appeared.

"No, this is not a fantasy!" he exclaimed. "It takes some ingenuity and bravery to solve this problem. The trick is...."

What do you think the trick is?

## Solution

The trick is to **dye the wood from the inside by introducing dye during the tree's growth**. By adding dye to the water used to irrigate the trees, the dye penetrates throughout the entire volume of the wood as the tree absorbs it while growing. This results in wood that is uniformly colored all the way through. When the wood is later used to make furniture, the color is inherent and cannot be scratched or stripped off because it's embedded within the wood itself.

This inventive solution involves applying the dye **in advance** during the tree's growth, ensuring long-lasting, scratch-resistant color in the finished furniture.
