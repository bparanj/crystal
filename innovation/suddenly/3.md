The problem **"What place should we choose"** from Genrich Altshuller's book **"And Suddenly the Inventor Appeared"** illustrates how TRIZ  can be applied to resolve conflicting requirements when selecting a location for a project or facility.

**The Problem:**

Imagine you need to choose a location for building a new industrial plant. There are two main, but conflicting, requirements:

1. **Proximity to Resources and Infrastructure:**
   - The plant should be close to raw material sources, suppliers, and transportation networks to reduce costs and improve efficiency.

2. **Minimizing Environmental and Social Impact:**
   - The plant should be located away from populated areas and sensitive ecosystems to reduce the risk of pollution, noise, and other negative impacts on people and the environment.

These requirements create a **contradiction**:

- **Technical Contradiction:** The plant needs to be both close to and far from populated areas at the same time.

**Applying TRIZ to Solve the Problem:**

TRIZ provides a systematic approach to identify and resolve contradictions without compromising on requirements.

**1. Identify the Contradiction:**

- **Feature to Improve:** Operational efficiency by being close to resources and infrastructure.
- **Conflicting Feature:** Environmental and social safety by being distant from populated areas.

**2. Analyze the Problem Using TRIZ Principles:**

One of the key TRIZ concepts is **Segmentation (Principle 1)** and **Separation of Contradictions**:

- **Spatial Separation:** Resolve the contradiction by separating conflicting requirements in space.

**3. Generate Innovative Solutions:**

**Solution A: Decentralize the Plant Operations**

- **Segmentation:** Divide the plant into separate units based on the nature of processes:

  - **Non-Polluting Units:** Place units that have minimal environmental impact close to resources and infrastructure.

  - **Polluting or Hazardous Units:** Locate units that handle hazardous materials or produce pollutants in areas far from populated regions or implement advanced containment measures.

**Visualization:**

- **Map Layout:**
  - Draw a map highlighting resource locations, populated areas, and potential plant sites.
  - Mark the non-polluting units near suppliers and transportation hubs.
  - Place the hazardous units in remote locations or design them to be safe within populated areas using advanced technology.

**Solution B: Implement Advanced Technologies**

- **Use of Advanced Pollution Control:** Equip the plant with cutting-edge pollution control and safety systems that mitigate environmental risks, allowing it to be closer to both resources and communities.

- **Principle of **'Do It Inversely'**:** Instead of isolating the plant from people, make the plant so safe that proximity is not an issue.

**Visualization:**

- **Design Schematics:**
  - Illustrate the plant with integrated safety features.
  - Show barriers, filters, and systems that prevent pollution.

**Solution C: Mobile or Temporary Facilities**

- **Dynamicity (Principle 15):** Use mobile or temporary facilities that can be relocated as needed.

**Visualization:**

- **Operational Diagram:**
  - Depict modular units that can be assembled near resources and moved away when necessary.



By applying TRIZ principles, specifically **Spatial Separation** and **Segmentation**, you can resolve the contradiction of location requirements:

- **Optimize Efficiency:** Keep essential operations near resources to reduce costs.
- **Ensure Safety:** Position hazardous processes away from vulnerable areas or mitigate risks through technology.

**Understanding Through Visualization:**

- **Step 1:** **Draw Two Circles** on a piece of paper—label one "Resources" and the other "Populated Area."
- **Step 2:** **Sketch the Plant Units**—divide them into "Safe Units" and "Hazardous Units."
- **Step 3:** **Place the Safe Units** near both circles, showing proximity to resources and workforce.
- **Step 4:** **Position Hazardous Units** away from the "Populated Area" circle or within the "Resources" circle with safety measures.
- **Step 5:** **Connect Units with Arrows** to represent the flow of materials and information between units.

**Takeaways:**

- TRIZ encourages looking beyond traditional compromises.
- By separating conflicting requirements, you can fulfill both without sacrificing one for the other.
- Visualization aids in comprehending how different elements of the solution interact spatially.

The problem "What place should we choose" demonstrates the power of TRIZ in solving complex location-based contradictions. By systematically analyzing the problem and applying inventive principles, you can develop innovative solutions that optimize efficiency while ensuring safety and compliance with environmental and social standards.
