# TRIZ Application: Solving the Mystery of the Missing Sunflower Oil

---

## **Problem Description:**

A company purchases sunflower oil delivered by tank trucks (tank-cars), each with a capacity of 750 gallons. Upon each delivery, the buyer discovers a consistent shortage of almost 30 liters of oil.

The buyer thoroughly investigates:

- **Measuring Devices:** All are found to be accurate.
- **Seals on the Upper Hatch:** Intact and unbroken.
- **Tank Leakage:** No leaks detected.
- **Oil Film on Tank Walls:** Accounted for but insufficient to explain the loss.
- **Temperature Variations:** Considered but not the cause.

Despite these efforts, the shortage remains unexplained. Experienced detectives are brought in to investigate:

- **Truck Movements:** The truck does not stop during delivery.
- **Driver's Actions:** The driver never removes oil from the tank during transit or delivery.
- **Surveillance:** No suspicious activities are observed.

Even the detectives are puzzled. Then, the Inventor appears and provides insight:

*"What kind of detectives are you?" he asked. "It's all very simple. We have to think for a while." Then he explained what was happening.*

## **Question:**

**What was happening to cause the consistent shortage of sunflower oil upon each delivery?**

---

## **Applying TRIZ Principles to Solve the Problem:**

The key to solving this mystery lies in utilizing a TRIZ inventive principle:

### **TRIZ Principle 10: Prior Action ("Do It in Advance")**

- **Definition:** Perform required changes or actions in advance to achieve the desired effect when needed.
- **Application:** If something cannot be done at the moment it's needed, prepare for it beforehand.

---

## **Solution:**

**The driver was stealing oil by using a hidden container placed inside the tank before it was filled.**

### **How It Happened:**

1. **Preparation in Advance:**

   - **Driver Hangs a Bucket Inside the Empty Tank:**
     - Before arriving at the vendor to load the oil, the driver places a bucket or container inside the empty tank.
     - The bucket is secured inside the tank, possibly hanging from the top or fixed in place, so it remains stable during transit.

2. **Filling the Tank:**

   - **Vendor Fills the Tank with Oil:**
     - The sunflower oil is loaded into the tank as usual.
     - The hidden bucket inside the tank also fills up with oil during this process.
     - Since the bucket is inside the tank, the total volume of oil loaded appears to be correct from external measurements.

3. **Delivery to the Buyer:**

   - **Unloading the Oil:**
     - Upon arrival at the buyer's facility, the oil is unloaded from the tank.
     - The bucket full of oil remains inside the tank, undetected.
     - Measurement devices show a shortage of approximately 30 litersâ€”the volume of oil contained in the hidden bucket.

4. **After Delivery:**

   - **Driver Retrieves the Bucket:**
     - At a later time, the driver removes the bucket from the tank.
     - The driver now has the stolen oil, which can be sold or used elsewhere.

## **Explanation Using TRIZ Principle 10: Prior Action ("Do It in Advance"):**

- **Action Taken Before It's Needed:**
  - The driver **prepares in advance** by placing the bucket inside the tank before filling.
- **Undetectable During Critical Moments:**
  - During filling and unloading, there is no suspicious activity because everything seems normal.
- **Problem Occurs Due to Prior Action:**
  - The shortage cannot be detected during transit or delivery because the critical action (placing the bucket) was done earlier.

---

## **Why Detectives and Others Failed to Discover the Issue:**

- **Focus on Delivery and Transit:**
  - Investigations concentrated on potential theft **during** transit or unloading.
- **Assumption of Integrity Inside the Tank:**
  - It was assumed that the tank's interior was empty except for the oil.
- **Overlooking Prior Preparation:**
  - The possibility of tampering **before** loading was not considered.
- **Lack of Verification of Empty Tank:**
  - The tank was not inspected while empty to ensure nothing was inside.

---

## **Preventing the Problem:**

To prevent such thefts, the following measures can be implemented:

1. **Inspect the Tank Before Filling:**

   - **Visual Inspection:**
     - Check the interior of the tank to ensure it is empty before loading.
   - **Seal Verification:**
     - Apply seals to the tank's access points after inspection to prevent unauthorized entry.

2. **Measure Oil Volume Precisely:**

   - **Before and After Loading:**
     - Measure the volume of oil loaded into the tank at the vendor's site and compare it with the volume unloaded.
   - **Use of Dipsticks or Sensors:**
     - Employ internal measurement devices that can detect inconsistencies in volume.

3. **Random Checks:**

   - **Unscheduled Inspections:**
     - Perform random checks of the tank's interior at loading and unloading points.
   - **Third-Party Monitoring:**
     - Use independent inspectors to verify procedures.

4. **Driver Accountability:**

   - **Strict Protocols:**
     - Implement protocols that require drivers to certify that tanks are empty before loading.
   - **Security Cameras:**
     - Use surveillance to monitor activities at critical points.

## **Conclusion:**

By applying **TRIZ Principle 10: Prior Action ("Do It in Advance")**, we uncover that the driver exploited advanced preparation to steal oil undetected. The driver's method was effective because the action causing the problem occurred **before** traditional points of focus (loading, transit, unloading).

---

## **Understanding TRIZ Principle 10 in This Context:**

- **Inventive Strategy:**
  - The driver inverted the expected sequence of events by acting **in advance**.
- **Problem-Solving Insight:**
  - Recognizing that issues might stem from prior actions can be crucial in troubleshooting unexplained problems.
- **Inventor's Approach:**
  - The Inventor emphasizes thinking beyond immediate symptoms and considering the entire process, including steps taken before the apparent problem arises.

---

## **Key Takeaways:**

- **Holistic Investigation:**
  - When faced with persistent, unexplained issues, consider actions taken at all stages, including those **before** the main process begins.
- **Application of TRIZ:**
  - TRIZ principles can reveal hidden aspects of a problem by encouraging creative thinking and challenging assumptions.
- **Prevention Strategies:**
  - Implementing checks and protocols that cover the entire process can prevent exploitation of prior actions.

---

## **Final Thoughts:**

This case demonstrates how understanding and applying TRIZ principles can solve complex problems that elude traditional investigative methods. By considering the possibility of prior actions affecting the outcome, we can uncover hidden causes and develop effective preventative measures.

Sometimes, the solution lies not in what is happening now, but in what happened **before**.
