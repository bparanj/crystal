## Technical Contradictions

TODO:

The answers are still pending

Chapter 3 questions to answer to understand the concepts:

1. What makes this problem challenging to solve using standard methods? What's the core contradiction?

2. Why doesn't cutting the steel ribbon before it enters the machine solve the problem?

3. What are the two competing requirements in the cutting mechanism design? How do they conflict?

4. How did engineers try to solve this initially? What were the drawbacks of their compromise solution?

5. Why is maintaining a continuous, unbroken process crucial for this machine?

6. What happened when they implemented the electronic system solution? What new problems did it create?

7. How does this example illustrate the limitations of simply applying known methods to solve problems?

These questions target the key engineering constraints, attempted solutions, and broader problem-solving principles.
