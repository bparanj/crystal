iIn the context of **TRIZ** (Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadach), which translates to the **"Theory of Inventive Problem Solving,"** an **inventive problem** is defined as a problem that contains inherent contradictions that cannot be resolved using standard, traditional methods within the field. These contradictions make the problem resistant to conventional solutions, necessitating innovative approaches to find a resolution.

**Characteristics of an Inventive Problem:**

1. **Presence of Contradictions:**
   - **Technical Contradictions:** Situations where improving one characteristic of a system leads to the deterioration of another. For example, making a material stronger might make it heavier.
   - **Physical (or Inherent) Contradictions:** Conditions where an element of the system must possess mutually exclusive properties. For instance, a component needs to be both hot and cold at the same time.

2. **Resistance to Standard Solutions:**
   - The problem cannot be effectively solved using existing knowledge, methods, or technologies within the field.
   - Conventional problem-solving approaches fail because they do not address the underlying contradictions.

3. **Necessity for Innovation:**
   - Resolving the problem requires creative thinking and novel solutions that transcend traditional boundaries.
   - TRIZ provides tools and principles to systematically overcome these contradictions and generate inventive solutions.

On the other hand, a **technical problem** in TRIZ refers to a problem that does not involve such contradictions and can be solved using standard methods and existing knowledge within the technical domain. Technical problems are typically straightforward and do not require significant innovation to resolve.

**Summary:**

- **Inventive Problem:** A complex problem characterized by inherent contradictions that cannot be resolved through standard methods, thus requiring inventive and innovative solutions.
- **Technical Problem:** A problem that can be solved using existing knowledge and conventional approaches without the need to address underlying contradictions.

**TRIZ and Inventive Problem Solving:**

TRIZ is a methodology developed by Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues, who, after studying millions of patents, identified patterns of innovation and principles that can be applied to solve inventive problems systematically. By focusing on overcoming contradictions, TRIZ enables problem solvers to think beyond conventional solutions and develop novel ideas that advance technology and innovation.

**Application of TRIZ:**

To tackle an inventive problem using TRIZ:

1. **Identify the Contradictions:** Clearly define the technical or physical contradictions inherent in the problem.
2. **Use TRIZ Principles:** Apply the 40 Inventive Principles, the Contradiction Matrix, and other TRIZ tools to find ways to overcome the contradictions.
3. **Develop Innovative Solutions:** Generate and evaluate potential solutions that resolve the contradictions without compromise.

**Example:**

- **Inventive Problem:** Designing an airplane wing that is both long (to improve lift) and short (to reduce weight and stress).
- **Contradiction:** The wing needs to be both long and short simultaneously.
- **TRIZ Application:** Use Principle 17 (Another Dimension) to design wings that can change shape or length during flight, such as wings that fold or extend, to satisfy both requirements.

In TRIZ, the distinction between technical and inventive problems lies in the presence of contradictions and the need for innovation to resolve them. Inventive problems drive technological advancement by challenging existing paradigms and inspiring creative solutions through systematic methodologies like TRIZ.
