## Ten Thousand Pyramids

In a research laboratory people were trying to develop diamond tools for polishing surfaces. The tools came out very well but it was difficult to manufacture them. The diamond grains had a pyramid shape and were very small. It was necessary to place them on the surface of the tool by hand with their tips facing up.

"Ten thousand pyramids and all by hand" said the agitated workers. "Why can't someone think of some way to mechanize this work?"

"We have tried" answered the supervisor of the lab "but nothing good has emerged!"

And here the inventor appeared.

"It is a wonderful problem" he said. "We have to recall the method..."

What method must we recall? How can the placement of the diamonds be mechanized?

## Solution

The method the inventor is referring to is the use of a **magnetic field to align the diamond grains automatically**.

**How the placement of the diamonds can be mechanized:**

1. **Coat the Diamond Grains with Ferromagnetic Material:**
   - Apply a thin layer of ferromagnetic material (such as iron or nickel) to the diamond grains. This makes the non-magnetic diamond grains responsive to magnetic fields.

2. **Apply a Magnetic Field:**
   - Spread the coated diamond grains onto the adhesive-coated surface of the tool.
   - Generate a magnetic field perpendicular to the tool's surface. The magnetic field causes the ferromagnetic-coated diamond grains to align themselves with their tips facing upward along the magnetic field lines.

3. **Secure the Aligned Grains:**
   - Once the grains are properly oriented, cure the adhesive to fix the diamonds in place.
   - After the adhesive sets, remove the magnetic field.

By utilizing a magnetic field and ferromagnetic coating, the diamond grains can be oriented uniformly without manual intervention. This method mechanizes the placement process, significantly reducing labor and increasing efficiency. It ensures that all the diamond grains are aligned with their tips facing up, which is essential for the effectiveness of the polishing tool.

This approach applies the principles of **Substance-Field (S-Field) Analysis** from the TRIZ methodology, introducing a new substance (the ferromagnetic coating) and a field (magnetic field) to achieve the desired effect [And Suddenly the Inventor Appeared TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (Genrich Altshuller)].
