How to Solve Problems That Do Not Exist Yet

The transition from the rough movement of metal parts to the fine movement of molecules and atoms is another principle of technical evolution. Therefore the method for solving many tasks is Method #15: Transition from macrostructure to microstructure.

The systems go through four periods. What is next?

When the system reaches its own limits it joins another system and a new, more complex system emerges. Thus the development continues. Ex: Bicycle + Internal Combustion Engine = Motocycle. As a new system evolves, the development continues.

Sometimes the road to consolidation between systems is closed. It is necessary to consolidate systems and yet it is impossible to do so. This type of contradiction could be removed by breaking up the existing system and recombining its parts into a new system.
