The author is using Baron Munchausen's fantastical story about a fox jumping out of its skin as a metaphor to illustrate a key point about problem-solving: just when you think you've grasped a solution to a technical contradiction, it can slip away, much like the fox escaping its skin. The author is emphasizing that:

1. Solutions can be elusive even when they seem within reach
2. Having a firm grasp on the problem (holding the contradiction with "strong hands") doesn't guarantee finding the answer
3. There may be multiple ways to resolve the same technical contradiction

The broader message is about the unpredictable and sometimes frustrating nature of problem-solving, particularly when dealing with technical contradictions.

Technical contradictions are derived from physical contradictions. At the heart of every technical contradiction is hidden a physical contradiction. One part of a technical system should have the characteristic A to perform a certain action, and it should have the contradictory characteristic anti-A to perform the opposite action.

A Technical Contradiction usually relates to the whole system, or to several parts of the system. A physical Contradiction relates only to one part of the system.
