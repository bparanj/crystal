In the ship repairing dock a new steamboat-catamaran was built.

"It is a wonderful ship," said the old master.

"Yes, it is a beautiful ship," agreed the engineer. "The main advantage of this ship is that it is very stable. This ship will go through many different conditions - partially on rivers, partially on the ocean. It is relatively calm on rivers, but on the ocean...."

And suddenly the Inventor appears.

"This ship is indeed very wonderful, nobody will argue that," he said. "But it needs one more improvement. It should be a catamaran and not a catamaran."

What kind of improvement do you think the Inventor had in mind?

When you work on this problem keep in mind that the system "catamaran + river" is part of a supersystem - "river transportation." This means that the catamaran should consider the interests of all parts of the supersystem.

## Method #9 Dynamization

The improvement the Inventor had in mind is to design the catamaran so that it can transform between being a catamaran and not a catamaran. This means creating a ship that can adjust its configuration based on the environment it operates in.

On the ocean, where stability is crucial due to rough conditions, the ship would function as a traditional catamaran with two hulls, providing the necessary stability. On rivers, however, operating as a catamaran might not be ideal due to narrower waterways, potential environmental impacts, or interference with other river traffic. In this setting, the ship could transform into a single-hull vessel (monohull), reducing its width and minimizing its impact on the river transportation system.

This transformation could be achieved through a mechanical system that allows the hulls to retract or move closer together when transitioning from ocean to river navigation and vice versa. By doing so, the ship considers the interests of all parts of the supersystem "river transportation," enhancing compatibility with river conditions and other vessels.

This solution aligns with the concept of **dynamization** in system development, progressing the system to the next period. By making the ship adaptable, we address both the needs for ocean stability and river maneuverability, effectively improving the system's integration within its supersystem.
