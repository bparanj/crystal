## An Almost Excellent Machine

At the industrial agricultural show an engineer was giving a demonstration of a fruit packaging conveyor.

Before this conveyor, fruits were packaged into carton containers by hand. Now it is done by machine. The conveyor places the container on the table. The fruits roll down through a trough. An electric motor vibrates the table for the fruits to be packed properly. This is an excellent machine but it has one defect. When the fruits fall into the container they hit each other and are damaged.

"Is it possible to lower the trough along which the fruits slides down to the container?" asked one of the visitors.

"Yes this is possible!" said the engineer. "The problem now is that while you are filling the container up you have to lift the trough. This means that we need an automatic system to control it. The machine will become more complicated. To lower the container is even more complicated..."

And suddenly the Inventor appeared.

"One apple hits the other one," he said. "This is a task for the rule of destroying the S-Field. Take..."

And he explained how to fix it so that none of the fruits will be damaged during the fall even the most fragile ones.

What can you offer?

## Solution

The Inventor is referring to the **TRIZ methodology of "destroying the S-Field"**, which involves eliminating the harmful interaction causing the problem. In this case, the **S-Field (Substance-Field)** represents the fruits (substances) interacting through the mechanical field (gravity and impact), resulting in damage when they collide.

**Solution:**

To prevent the fruits from being damaged, the Inventor suggests **eliminating the harmful mechanical interaction** between them. This can be achieved by:

1. **Introducing a Soft Cushioning Layer:**
   - **Line the Container:** Place a layer of soft material, such as foam or padding, at the bottom and sides of the container to absorb the impact.
   - **Benefits:** The cushioning absorbs the force when fruits land, preventing bruising and damage.

2. **Using an Air Cushion or Airflow:**
   - **Air Jets:** Install air jets that blow upward inside the container, creating a cushion of air that slows down the fruits as they descend.
   - **Controlled Descent:** The airflow reduces the speed at which the fruits fall, minimizing impact forces.
   - **Benefits:** Gentle landing of fruits without physical alterations to the trough or container.

3. **Modifying the Trough Design:**
   - **Extend the Trough:** Adjust the trough so it extends deeper into the container, allowing fruits to slide directly to the bottom without falling.
   - **Flexible or Telescopic Trough:** Use a trough that automatically adjusts its length as the container fills, eliminating the need for complex lifting mechanisms.
   - **Spiral Chute:** Implement a spiral or curved chute that guides fruits gently into the container.
   - **Benefits:** Removes the drop height, preventing fruits from colliding and getting damaged.

4. **Using a Gentle Vibration Mechanism:**
   - **Vibrating Conveyor:** Adjust the vibration settings so that fruits move smoothly into the container without bouncing or hitting each other.
   - **Benefits:** Controlled placement of fruits reduces collisions.

By **eliminating the free-fall and direct collisions** between the fruits, we effectively "destroy the S-Field" causing the damage. The solutions focus on **removing or neutralizing the harmful mechanical field** (impact due to gravity) without adding complexity to the machine.

- **Advantages of This Approach:**
  - **Maintains Machine Simplicity:** Avoids complex systems for lifting or lowering components.
  - **Protects Delicate Fruits:** Even the most fragile fruits are preserved without damage.
  - **Enhances Efficiency:** Allows the packaging process to continue smoothly without interruptions.

The Inventor's idea leverages the TRIZ principle of eliminating harmful interactions by modifying the system to prevent the damaging effects of the mechanical field. By implementing one of these solutions, the fruit packaging process can be improved to ensure fruits are packed without damage, enhancing product quality and customer satisfaction.
