Explain Rule #2: If, by specification of the problem, a "worthless" S-Field is present, an introduction of substance S3 between S1 and S2 is necessary in order to improve it. This S3 could be a modification of S1 or S2

Rule #2 in Substance-Field (S-Field) Analysis states that if, according to the problem's specification, a "worthless" or ineffective S-Field exists, introducing a new substance **S3** between **S1** and **S2** is necessary to improve it. This substance **S3** can also be a modification of either **S1** or **S2**.

**Explanation:**

- **Worthless S-Field:** An S-Field is considered "worthless" when it fails to perform its intended function effectively or produces undesirable effects. This typically happens when the interaction between the two substances (**S1** and **S2**) and the field is insufficient, leading to a weak or harmful interaction.

- **Introducing Substance S3:**
  - **Purpose:** The introduction of **S3** enhances or modifies the interaction between **S1** and **S2**. It acts as an intermediary that facilitates a more effective or controlled interaction.
  - **Modification of S1 or S2:** Instead of adding a completely new substance, **S3** can be a modification of **S1** or **S2**. This means altering the properties or state of one of the substances to improve the interaction.

**How It Improves the S-Field:**

- **Enhances Interaction:** **S3** can improve the energy transfer or the effect of the field between **S1** and **S2**, leading to better performance.
- **Eliminates Harmful Effects:** It can mitigate or eliminate unwanted side effects caused by the direct interaction of **S1** and **S2**.
- **Completes the S-Field Model:** By adding **S3**, the S-Field becomes complete and functional, adhering to the TRIZ principle that a minimal functioning system requires two substances and a field.

**Example:**

- **Cutting Tool Application:**
  - **Problem (Worthless S-Field):** A cutting tool (**S2**) interacting with metal workpieces (**S1**) overheats due to friction, causing tool wear and poor cutting quality.
  - **Solution:** Introduce a coolant or lubricant (**S3**) between the tool and the workpiece.
    - **Effect:** The coolant reduces friction and dissipates heat, improving cutting efficiency and prolonging tool life.
    - **Modification Alternative:** Applying a coating to the cutting tool (modifying **S2**) that reduces friction can also serve as **S3**.

- **Electrical Contacts:**
  - **Problem (Worthless S-Field):** Electrical contacts (**S1**) and connectors (**S2**) corrode over time, leading to poor conductivity.
  - **Solution:** Apply a conductive grease (**S3**) between the contacts and connectors.
    - **Effect:** The grease prevents corrosion and maintains good electrical conductivity.
    - **Modification Alternative:** Plating the contacts with a corrosion-resistant material (modifying **S1** or **S2**) acts as **S3**.

**Summary:**

Rule #2 emphasizes the importance of enhancing an ineffective system by introducing an intermediary substance that improves the interaction between existing components. This approach allows for innovative solutions by either adding a new element or modifying existing ones to achieve the desired outcome.

By applying this rule, problems associated with ineffective or harmful interactions can be resolved, leading to a more efficient and functional system. It encourages thinking beyond the initial components of a system and considering how modifications or additions can facilitate better performance.

## Bypass Way

In order to solve the problem it is easier to introduce S3. When this is prohibited by the conditions of the task a contradiction arises: It is necessary to introduce a third substance S3, and it is prohibited to do so. The following rule shows a bypass way to do that.
The third substance, S3, should be a modification of an already known substance, S1 or S2. Then the contradiction is removed. There is an S3, and there is no S3.
