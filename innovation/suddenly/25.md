## Stubborn Spring

To solve this problem, we need to address the contradiction that the spring must be both **compressed and not compressed**, **free and not free**. The solution is to use the **device itself to compress the spring during assembly**, allowing the spring to remain free inside without any ties or restraints.

**Solution:**

1. **Place the Uncompressed Spring into the Device:**
   - Insert the uncompressed spiral spring into its designated position inside the device or between the pages of the book.

2. **Use the Cover to Compress the Spring:**
   - As you close the cover of the device or the book, the cover itself compresses the spring.
   - The action of closing applies the necessary force to compress the spring to the required length.

3. **Finalize the Assembly:**
   - Secure the cover in place. The spring is now held in a compressed state by the closed device.
   - Inside the device, the spring remains free—there are no strings or additional restraints holding it.

**Explanation:**

- **Resolution of the Contradiction:**
  - **Compressed but Free:** The spring is compressed by the device's cover, yet it is free inside because it's not tied or fixed by any separate component.
  - **Separation in Space:** The conflicting requirements are resolved within the space of the device—the spring is unrestricted internally but constrained by the device's boundaries.

- **Advantages:**
  - **No Need for External Restraints:** Eliminates the use of strings or tools that would need to be removed after assembly.
  - **Ready to Expand When Needed:** The spring can expand or function as intended when the device operates or the book is opened.
  - **Efficient Assembly:** Simplifies the assembly process by combining compression and enclosure into one action.

By designing the assembly process so that the spring is compressed during the closing of the device, we effectively solve the problem. The spring remains free inside, ready to perform its function, and we avoid the need for any additional restraints that could hinder its operation. This approach ingeniously satisfies both conditions by utilizing the existing structure of the device to resolve the contradiction.
