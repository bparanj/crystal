At a factory that makes agricultural machinery, there is a small piece of fenced land used for testing equipment mobility. The factory received orders to manufacture machinery for many different countries with different soils. They needed to test machines on 140 different soil compositions.

"We need 140 different fields," said the president to his engineer at the meeting. "How can we get so much land?"

"It will take a lot of money," added the chief accountant. "No, it is not realistic to build 140 fields! The situation is hopeless!"

And suddenly the Inventor appeared.

"There are no hopeless situations," he said. "We can build one universal field that would replace 140. What we need is...."

What do you think we need?

## Solution

The Inventor suggests creating a **universal test field with adjustable soil conditions** that can simulate all 140 different soil compositions within the same space. Instead of building multiple fields, the factory can design a single field where the soil properties can be dynamically modified to replicate various types of soil.

This can be achieved by:

- **Modular Soil Sections**: Dividing the field into sections with removable or interchangeable soil beds. Each section can be filled with different soil compositions as needed, allowing for quick changes between tests.
- **Soil Mixing Systems**: Installing equipment that can mix and alter soil components (sand, silt, clay, organic matter) in the field. By adjusting the ratios, the field can mimic different soil types.
- **Adjustable Environmental Controls**: Incorporating systems to control moisture content, compaction levels, and other soil characteristics. This enables the simulation of various soil conditions like wetness, dryness, density, and hardness.
- **Layered Soil Beds**: Designing the field with layers of different soil types that can be brought to the surface as needed. Mechanical systems can shift these layers to change the soil composition on the testing surface.

By making the test field adaptable, the factory can efficiently test machinery on any required soil type without the need for additional land. This solution follows the **Law of Increasing Dynamization**, progressing the system to a more advanced stage where it becomes flexible and responsive to varying requirements. It not only saves space and money but also accelerates the testing process by having all soil types readily available within a single, dynamic field.
