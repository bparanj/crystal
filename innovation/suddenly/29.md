The other way around

This is Method #9: Fragmentation and or consolidation

Fragmentation and consolidation (also, process and anti-process) are used often in solving inventive problems. When there is a two part contradiction - something should be and should not be. There is a two part key to solve it.

In **TRIZ**, **"The Other Way Around"** corresponds to **Inventive Principle 13: 'Do It in Reverse'**. This principle encourages solving problems by considering the opposite action or sequence to achieve the desired result.

**Fragmentation** and **Consolidation** are also key concepts in TRIZ:

- **Fragmentation (Segmentation)**:
  - **Principle 1: Segmentation**
  - Involves dividing an object or system into independent parts to improve flexibility, control, or adaptability.
  - Example: Breaking a large project into smaller tasks to manage it more effectively.

- **Consolidation (Merging)**:
  - **Principle 5: Merging**
  - Involves combining similar or related objects, operations, or systems to simplify processes or enhance functionality.
  - Example: Merging several departments into one to improve communication and efficiency.

**Relationship Between "The Other Way Around" and Fragmentation/Consolidation:**

1. **Reversing the Approach**:
   - When faced with a problem, considering the opposite of the usual method can lead to innovative solutions.
   - If the standard approach is to **fragment** a system for better control, doing it "the other way around" would mean **consolidating** or merging components to achieve improvement, and vice versa.

2. **Balancing Opposing Strategies**:
   - Fragmentation and consolidation are opposing strategies.
   - Applying "The Other Way Around" encourages examining if the opposite strategy could solve the problem more effectively.
   - This helps in identifying whether breaking down (fragmenting) or combining (consolidating) elements provides a better solution.

3. **Challenging Assumptions**:
   - Often, we become accustomed to solving problems in a particular way.
   - "The Other Way Around" prompts us to challenge these assumptions.
   - For instance, if we assume that integrating systems is the best approach, considering fragmentation might reveal advantages we hadn't seen.

**Example:**

- **Product Design**:
  - **Typical Approach (Fragmentation)**: A company designs a multipurpose tool by combining several tools into one gadget.
  - **"The Other Way Around" (Consolidation to Fragmentation)**: Instead, they could design modular tools where each function is a separate, specialized attachment.
  - **Benefit**: Customers can customize their toolkits, carrying only what they need, which improves portability and user experience.

- **Business Strategy**:
  - **Usual Method (Consolidation)**: A corporation merges departments to streamline operations.
  - **Applying "The Other Way Around" (Consolidation to Fragmentation)**: The company considers decentralizing, giving individual departments more autonomy.
  - **Benefit**: Increases flexibility and allows departments to respond more quickly to market changes.

**"The Other Way Around"** is related to **Fragmentation/Consolidation** by encouraging us to consider the opposite of our initial approach to problem-solving. By reversing our strategy—switching from fragmentation to consolidation or vice versa—we can uncover innovative solutions that might not be apparent using traditional methods. This principle helps break habitual thinking patterns, allowing us to explore alternative pathways that balance the benefits of both fragmentation and consolidation in creating effective solutions.

## Combining Two Methods

**"The Other Way Around"** and **Fragmentation/Consolidation** can indeed be combined to solve a problem. In fact, integrating different TRIZ principles often leads to more innovative and effective solutions. By combining these methods, you can approach problems from multiple angles, increasing the chances of finding a successful resolution.

### **How They Can Be Combined:**

1. **Applying "The Other Way Around" to Fragmentation/Consolidation:**

   - **Fragmentation (Segmentation):**
     - Involves breaking down a system, process, or object into smaller, more manageable parts to improve flexibility, customization, or efficiency.
   - **Consolidation (Merging):**
     - Involves combining similar or related components to simplify the system, enhance functionality, or reduce complexity.
   - **"The Other Way Around":**
     - Encourages considering the opposite of the usual approach. If you typically fragment a system to solve a problem, try consolidating it instead, and vice versa.

2. **Creating Innovative Solutions:**

   - **Reversing Approaches:**
     - By applying "The Other Way Around," you challenge conventional thinking. This might reveal that combining elements (consolidation) where you usually separate them (fragmentation), or splitting components where you usually merge them, leads to a better solution.
   - **Dual Application:**
     - Sometimes, both fragmentation and consolidation can be used together in different parts of the system to optimize overall performance.

### **Example of Combining the Principles:**

**Problem:**

A company produces a modular furniture system that allows customers to customize their setups. However, some customers find the assembly process too complicated due to the many small parts (fragmentation), leading to dissatisfaction.

**Solution Combining the Principles:**

1. **Apply "The Other Way Around":**

   - **Reverse Fragmentation:** Instead of offering numerous small parts, consider pre-assembling certain components.

2. **Consolidate Components:**

   - **Consolidation:** Merge smaller parts into larger, more manageable modules that are easier to handle and assemble.

3. **Maintain Customization:**

   - **Selective Fragmentation:** Still allow for customization by keeping some elements modular.

**Result:**

- The furniture system becomes easier to assemble due to fewer, larger components, improving customer satisfaction.
- By combining "The Other Way Around" with consolidation, the company reduces complexity without entirely sacrificing the flexibility that fragmentation offers.

### **Benefits:**

- **Enhanced Creativity:**
  - Combining principles pushes you to think beyond standard solutions.
- **Balanced Solutions:**
  - Integrating opposing approaches can lead to a more optimized system.
- **Problem Reframing:**
  - Viewing the problem from different perspectives may reveal previously unnoticed opportunities.

By combining **"The Other Way Around"** with **Fragmentation/Consolidation**, you can develop innovative approaches to problem-solving. This combination allows you to:

- **Explore Opposite Strategies:**
  - Challenge assumptions by considering the reverse of conventional methods.
- **Optimize Systems Holistically:**
  - Use fragmentation and consolidation where each is most effective within the same solution.
- **Increase Solution Space:**
  - Expand the range of possible solutions by integrating multiple principles.

In practice, this means not limiting yourself to a single method but being open to combining strategies to find the most effective solution to a problem.
