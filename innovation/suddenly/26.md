Every time system A combines with system B a new system AB emerges. This new system AB has, in principle, new characteristics - new qualities that neither A nor B had before. Even when a new system is formed out of the simple A + A, the result is not equal to 2A but to something bigger. For example: One boat plus one boat combined into a system is not equal to two boats. It is a catamaran. The system catamaran is more stable than just two separate boats.

## Combining Systems

When you combine **System A** with **System B**, a new system, **AB**, is formed. This new system has new characteristics and qualities that neither **A** nor **B** had individually. The combination creates something greater than just adding the two systems together.

Even when combining two identical systems (**A + A**), the result isn't just twice **A**; it's something bigger and different. This is because the interaction between the systems brings about new properties.

**Example:**

- **Two Boats Forming a Catamaran:**
  - **Separate Boats:** If you have two separate boats, each functions on its own with its own capabilities.
  - **Combined Boats (Catamaran):** When you join the two boats side by side to create a catamaran, you form a new system. The catamaran isn't just two boats; it's a single vessel with enhanced stability and performance.
  - **New Characteristics:** The catamaran is more stable than the individual boats because the wider base reduces the likelihood of tipping over. This increased stability is a new quality that didn't exist in the individual boats.

**Key Point:**

- **Emergent Properties:** The new system **AB** exhibits **emergent properties**, meaning it has features and capabilities that weren't present in **A** or **B** alone.
- **Greater Than the Sum:** The whole system is **greater than the sum of its parts** due to the interactions and relationships between the combined elements.

**In Summary:**

Every time systems are combined, they create a new system with unique qualities and characteristics that surpass what the individual systems had. This principle shows how combining elements can lead to innovative solutions and enhanced functionalities that weren't possible with the separate parts alone.
