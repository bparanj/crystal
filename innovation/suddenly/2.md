The **'Do It Inversely'** principle, also known as **Principle 13: 'Do It in Reverse'**, is one of the 40 inventive principles of **TRIZ** (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) developed by Genrich Altshuller. This principle suggests reversing the action of a process or the components of a system to solve a problem or achieve innovation.

**Explanation:**

- **Reverse Action:** Instead of performing the usual action, do the opposite. For example, if a process typically involves heating, consider cooling instead.
- **Invert Functions:** Turn objects or systems upside down or inside out to discover new functionalities or improve performance.
- **Reverse Process Sequence:** Change the order of operations. Perform tasks in the opposite sequence to see if it yields better results.
- **Reciprocal Actions:** Make the movable parts of an object or system fixed, and the fixed parts movable.

**When It Can Be Used in Innovation:**

- **Problem-Solving:** When conventional methods fail to resolve an issue, reversing actions can unveil alternative solutions.
- **Product Development:** To create innovative products by inverting traditional designs or functionalities.
- **Process Improvement:** To optimize processes by altering the sequence of steps or reversing operations for efficiency or effectiveness.
- **Creative Thinking:** To challenge assumptions and stimulate out-of-the-box thinking by considering the opposite of standard practices.

**Examples:**

1. **Reverse Vending Machines:** Instead of dispensing products when money is inserted, these machines accept used items (like bottles or cans) and return money or vouchers, promoting recycling.

2. **Anti-Graffiti Paint:** Applying a coating that repels paint, making it difficult for graffiti to adhere, thus reversing the problem of vandalism.

3. **Navigation Systems:** Traditional maps require you to find your route; navigation apps reverse this by having the system find the route for you based on your destination.

4. **Microphones and Speakers:** A speaker can function as a microphone when used inversely, demonstrating interchangeable functions when roles are reversed.

By applying the 'Do It Inversely' principle, innovators can discover unconventional solutions and new opportunities by simply considering the reverse of established methods. This approach encourages flexibility and creativity, essential components in the innovation process.

The 'Do It Inversely' principle suggests solving problems by reversing or inverting the standard approach. Examples:

1. Instead of heating something, cool it
2. Rather than adding components, remove them
3. Turn a fixed part into a moving one (or vice versa)

Common applications:
- Manufacturing: Flipping assembly sequences
- Product design: Inverting component relationships
- Process optimization: Reversing workflow steps
- Quality control: Testing for failures instead of successes

This principle is most effective when:
- Conventional approaches hit limitations
- Problems seem unsolvable with direct methods
- Resource constraints require creative solutions
- System complexity can be reduced through inversion

A classic example is the airbag system: instead of adding more padding for safety, it uses controlled explosion (inverse of protection) to create protection.
