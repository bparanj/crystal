This seems to map well to the Cloud Computing where:

compute -> code
storage -> data
networking -> infrastructure

Indeed, the mapping of TRIZ principles to cloud computing aligns well with the core components of cloud infrastructure, such as compute, storage, and networking. By viewing these components through the lens of code, data, and infrastructure, we can apply TRIZ's Inventive Principles to innovate and solve problems specific to cloud computing environments. Here's how this mapping could be utilized:

### Compute → Code (Algorithms)
- **Optimization and Efficiency**: Use TRIZ principles to develop more efficient, scalable, and resilient cloud-based applications. For example, the principle of "Dynamics" could inspire the creation of auto-scaling solutions that adjust compute resources in real time based on demand.
- **Serverless Architectures**: Apply principles like "Segmentation" or "Taking out" to break down applications into smaller, function-based components that run in response to events, optimizing resource usage and operational simplicity.

### Storage → Data
- **Data Management**: The principle of "Taking out" can be applied to optimize data storage by identifying and removing redundant data, or by employing data deduplication techniques. Similarly, "Local quality" could lead to the use of varied data storage solutions (e.g., hot, cool, and archive storage tiers) based on access patterns and cost efficiency.
- **Database Optimization**: Use "Asymmetry" or "Another dimension" to design database schemas or select database technologies (SQL vs. NoSQL) that best fit the application's data access patterns, ensuring performance and scalability.

### Networking → Infrastructure
- **Network Optimization**: Principles such as "Equipotentiality" might suggest the design of network topologies that minimize latency or optimize data flow between different parts of the cloud infrastructure.
- **Security and Isolation**: Apply "Taking out" or "Segmentation" to enhance security, using network segmentation, firewalls, and virtual private clouds (VPCs) to isolate environments and minimize the attack surface.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Scalability and Elasticity**: The principle of "Dynamics" supports the design of systems that automatically adapt to changing workloads by scaling resources up or down.
- **Cost Optimization**: "Anti-weight" can be interpreted as minimizing the cost impact of resources, encouraging the use of spot instances or reserved instances to optimize cloud expenses.
- **Resilience and Fault Tolerance**: "Preliminary action" and "Preliminary anti-action" encourage the design of systems that anticipate and mitigate failures through strategies like redundancy, backup, and disaster recovery.

### Implementation Strategy
To effectively apply TRIZ principles to cloud computing:
1. **Identify Challenges**: Clearly define the specific problems or areas for improvement within your cloud environment.
2. **Select Relevant Principles**: Choose TRIZ principles that best match the nature of the challenges identified.
3. **Analogical Thinking**: Creatively adapt and apply these principles to develop innovative solutions for compute (code), storage (data), and networking (infrastructure) challenges.
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Test and refine these solutions, leveraging cloud computing's flexibility and scalability to iterate rapidly.

By mapping TRIZ to the foundational elements of cloud computing, we can systematically address complex challenges, driving innovation and efficiency in cloud architectures and operations. This approach not only enhances problem-solving capabilities but also encourages a more strategic, design-thinking approach to cloud infrastructure management and development.

You've identified a fascinating parallel between the breakdown of  information technology characteristics and the fundamental components of Cloud Computing. Let's elaborate on why this mapping highlights how a revised application of TRIZ principles holds specific relevance for designing cloud-native systems:

**Mapping Breakdown**

* **Objects --> Compute:**  The focus on code modularity, microservices, and function decomposition for scalable, independent processing units. Cloud functions (AWS Lambda, etc.)  epitomize this. 

* **Data --> Storage:** Cloud storage offers the ability to 'segment' data (sharding), leverage diverse models (structured, NoSQL, object stores), and distribute geographically for low latency and resilience.

* **Algorithms --> Networking:**  Software-defined networking (SDN) decouples routing and infrastructure management. APIs control load balancing and service mesh patterns optimize routing efficiency. Networking has become as programmable as other system components.

**TRIZ Implications**

This mapping underscores why translating TRIZ for cloud software is valuable and requires rethinking rather than direct analogy:

* **Dynamic Contradictions:** The ability to scale in an on-demand way in the cloud introduces unique contradictions with cost-efficiency. TRIZ patterns on managing parameters and resources based on workload variability may be key.  
* **Ideality Revisited:** 'Ideal' software in the cloud is highly responsive, geographically distributed, and can self-adjust as demand evolves. Existing TRIZ 'evolution towards ideality' concepts would have to be re-examined through this lens. 
* **Service as Super System:** Building on APIs and the cloud provider's service ecosystem presents challenges of integration and dependencies.  Rethought principles related to 'transitions to super-systems' can prove particularly applicable.

 **Potential New Principle Clusters**

Inspired by the cloud paradigm, new 'software TRIZ' clusters could emerge that map more accurately:

* **Elasticity Principles:** Guidance on designing across objects, data, and processes to enable seamless expansion and contraction in response to load and needs. 
* **Composability Principles:**  Focus on the ease of integrating  functions, data units, and services, minimizing tight coupling that would introduce bottlenecks in a cloud architecture.
* **Distribution Principles:** Dealing with optimal partitioning of workloads and data, as well as replication decisions based on performance versus redundancy goals. 

This  approach goes beyond analogy;  it recognizes that cloud computing embodies distinct principles of scale and abstraction that warrant their own tailored TRIZ-inspired tools for problem-solving and innovation.
