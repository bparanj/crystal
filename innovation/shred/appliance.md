The **WipeOS appliance** is a dedicated hardware device, but without typical peripherals like a monitor, keyboard, or mouse. It is designed to serve as a data erasure tool. This device operates similarly to a server, as its function is to manage network-based disk wiping for client machines.

- It **acts as a server**, offering network services like PXE boot to client devices that need data wiping.
- It operates on the network, communicating with client machines to facilitate disk wiping.
- It is designed to be **headless** (no monitor, keyboard, or mouse), and administrators manage it remotely, often through a web portal or command-line interface.

The appliance connects to the local network and works by booting client machines via PXE (network boot) to initiate the disk wiping process. It's specialized hardware or software pre-configured to handle these operations efficiently.

You can use a ThinkPad running Ubuntu to implement the functionality of a WipeOS appliance. The core requirements of a WipeOS appliance are its ability to manage data wiping tasks over a network, such as booting client machines via PXE and running disk wiping operations. These functionalities can be achieved on an Ubuntu-based machine.

### Steps to set up the ThinkPad as a WipeOS-like appliance:

1. **Network Boot Setup (PXE Server)**:
   - Install and configure a **TFTP server** and **DHCP server** on the Ubuntu system to enable network boot (PXE) for client machines.
   - This allows you to boot client devices over the network and push a disk wiping operating system to them, similar to how the WipeOS appliance works.

   Install necessary packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install tftpd-hpa isc-dhcp-server
   ```

2. **Disk Wiping Software**:
   - Use disk wiping tools like **Nwipe** (a command-line utility) or **ShredOS** (a bootable version that uses Nwipe) to perform secure disk erasure.
   - These tools provide various wiping standards such as DoD 5220.22-M, NIST SP 800-88, etc.

3. **Remote Management**:
   - Since the ThinkPad will operate without peripherals, you can set up **SSH** or use **Webmin** for remote management.
   - This allows you to control the device headlessly, similar to how a WipeOS appliance is managed.

4. **Automated Wiping Process**:
   - Set up scripts or automation tools to initiate disk wiping on client machines as soon as they boot through the PXE server.
   - You can write a script to automatically deploy Nwipe or another wiping tool to the client machines.

### Benefits:
- **Cost-Effective**: You can repurpose an existing ThinkPad, which is much more cost-effective than purchasing a dedicated appliance.
- **Flexibility**: Running Ubuntu gives you more flexibility to customize the wiping process and handle additional tasks.
- **Portability**: A ThinkPad provides portability while still offering sufficient power for network management and wiping tasks.

### Key Considerations:
- **Performance**: Ensure the ThinkPad has sufficient hardware (CPU, RAM, storage) to handle multiple concurrent wiping operations if necessary.
- **Network Configuration**: You’ll need to ensure proper network setup, especially for PXE booting and managing DHCP and TFTP services.

ThinkPad running Ubuntu can be repurposed to function as a WipeOS appliance, with the appropriate setup of network services and disk wiping software.
