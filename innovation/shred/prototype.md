To build a minimal prototype for WipeOS, focusing on the core feature of securely wiping a single disk using one standard, here are the steps to follow:

### Core Feature: Disk Wipe with a Standard (e.g., NIST SP 800-88r1)

---

### 1. **Setup Environment**

#### 1.1 **Required Materials**
- A Linux-based machine (can serve as the WipeOS "appliance")
- A test machine or virtual machine with a disk to be wiped
- Network connection (for machine-to-machine communication)
- Nwipe (or an equivalent disk wiping tool)

---

### 2. **Install Nwipe**

Nwipe is a simple command-line tool that can securely erase disks based on various standards,  NIST SP 800-88r1.

#### 2.1 **Installation Steps**
   - On the appliance machine, install Nwipe:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install nwipe
     ```

#### 2.2 **Check Disk to be Wiped**
   - List available disks:
     ```bash
     sudo fdisk -l
     ```
   - Identify the disk to wipe (e.g., `/dev/sda`).

---

### 3. **Wipe the Disk**

#### 3.1 **Basic Nwipe Command**
   - Use the following command to perform a wipe based on the NIST SP 800-88r1 standard:
     ```bash
     sudo nwipe --method=nist800_88r1 --verify --autonuke /dev/sda
     ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `--method=nist800_88r1`: Selects the NIST SP 800-88r1 wipe method.
   - `--verify`: Ensures that the wipe is verified after completion.
   - `--autonuke`: Automatically starts the wipe process without further user input.
   - `/dev/sda`: Specifies the disk to be wiped.

#### 3.2 **Monitor the Process**
   - As there is no UI, monitor the terminal for progress updates. Nwipe will display the wipe status,  completion percentage, speed, and any errors encountered.

---

### 4. **Test the Prototype**

#### 4.1 **Run on a Single Machine**
   - Connect the test machine with the disk to be wiped.
   - Boot the test machine into a Linux environment (using a live USB or PXE boot).
   - Use Nwipe to initiate the wipe on the test machine, following the same steps as above.

---

### 5. **Refine Prototype for Minimal Operation**

Since the goal is to focus solely on wiping, ignore features like logging, remote operations, or multiple wipe methods. The prototype will be purely command-line-based and will only wipe one disk at a time using the selected wipe method.

---

### Summary

The prototype focuses on:
1. Wiping a single disk using the NIST SP 800-88r1 standard.
2. No UI or portal integration.
3. Command-line-based operation using Nwipe.
4. Simple, minimal process that can be run on one machine without network dependencies.

This minimal setup will demonstrate the core functionality without unnecessary features.

I apologize for the misunderstanding. You're absolutely right - a prototype should focus on the core functionality without unnecessary complexities. Let's create a stripped-down version that demonstrates the essential feature: securely wiping a single disk on one machine. Here's a revised plan for a minimal prototype:

1. Set up the development environment:
   - Use a basic Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu Server minimal install)
   - Install essential development tools (gcc, make)

2. Develop the core disk wiping functionality:
   - Write a C program that performs a single-pass zero write on a disk
   - Implement basic disk detection (e.g., list available /dev/sd* devices)

3. Create a simple command-line interface:
   - Allow the user to select a disk from the detected devices
   - Prompt for confirmation before wiping

4. Implement the NIST SP 800-88r1 Clear standard:
   - Modify the wiping function to perform a single-pass write of zeros
   - Add a basic verification step (read back a sample of sectors)

5. Add basic error handling:
   - Implement checks for common errors (e.g., disk not found, permission denied)
   - Display error messages to the console

6. Create a simple bootable environment:
   - Set up a minimal Linux system that boots directly into the wiping program
   - Use tools like buildroot or yocto to create a custom, lightweight Linux image

7. Test the prototype:
   - Test on a variety of disk types (HDD, SSD) to ensure basic functionality
   - Verify that the wiping process completes successfully

This prototype focuses solely on the core feature of disk wiping, implementing just one standard (NIST SP 800-88r1 Clear), and operates on a single machine without any network functionality, UI, or additional features. It provides a basic proof of concept for the central functionality of WipeOS.

To build this prototype:

1. Write the disk wiping program in C.
2. Compile and test the program on your development machine.
3. Create a bootable Linux image that includes your program.
4. Test the bootable image on a separate machine to ensure it works as expected.

This approach allows you to demonstrate the core functionality quickly and efficiently, providing a solid foundation for future development of more advanced features.
