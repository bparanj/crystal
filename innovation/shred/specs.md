Based on the image you provided, here are the identified hardware elements:

1. **DC-IN (Power Input)**:
   - This is the port where the power adapter connects to provide electricity to the device.

2. **LAN Ports (2x Ethernet)**:
   - Two LAN ports (RJ45) for network connections, allowing the device to act as a network appliance, potentially for routing, switching, or PXE booting.

3. **HDMI Port**:
   - An HDMI output port to connect a display for visual output. This could be used for connecting a monitor when needed for setup or debugging.

4. **USB Ports (4x USB-A)**:
   - Four USB-A ports, likely for connecting peripherals such as a keyboard, mouse, or external storage devices.

This device appears to be a small-form-factor computing appliance, similar to devices like the Intel NUC or other mini-PCs, that can be used for networking or embedded systems development.

This image shows the back panel of a small form factor computer or networking device. The visible hardware elements are:

1. DC IN port: For power input
2. Two LAN (Ethernet) ports: For network connectivity
3. HDMI port: For video output
4. Two USB ports: For connecting peripherals or storage devices

The device has a blue casing, and the ports are located on a black panel. The overall design suggests this is a compact, possibly fanless device designed for networking or as a small form factor PC. The presence of dual LAN ports indicates it may be intended for networking applications or as a router/firewall device.


Here are the ports identified on the machine from the provided image:

1. **SD Card Slot**:
   - This is used for reading and writing to SD cards,  used for portable storage or system recovery.

2. **USB 3.0 Port (Type-A)**:
   - A high-speed USB 3.0 port for connecting peripherals like external hard drives, flash drives, or other USB devices.

3. **USB Type-C Port**:
   - A versatile USB Type-C port, likely supporting power delivery, data transfer, or connecting newer USB-C devices.

4. **AUX Port (3.5mm Audio Jack)**:
   - A standard 3.5mm audio jack for connecting audio input/output devices like speakers, headphones, or microphones.

These ports provide multiple connectivity options, suitable for external storage devices and peripheral accessories. The presence of a USB 3.0 and USB Type-C port suggests support for modern, high-speed data transfer.

This image shows a close-up view of the front panel of a WipeOS device. The ports and features visible are:

1. SD card slot: This appears to be a standard SD card reader.
2. USB 3.0 port: A blue USB port, indicating it's a USB 3.0 specification for faster data transfer.
3. USB-C port: A smaller, oval-shaped port that is likely a USB Type-C connector.
4. AUX port: Labeled as "AUX", this is likely an auxiliary audio port or potentially for other peripheral connections.

The device has a blue casing with a black panel where the ports are located. The "WipeOS" branding is clearly visible on the front, indicating this is a specialized device likely used for data wiping or secure erasure of storage devices.
