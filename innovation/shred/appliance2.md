Using a separate WipeOS appliance offers several benefits for data erasure and security:

1. **Enhanced Security**: By using a dedicated appliance, you can ensure that data is securely wiped from devices before they are removed from your network. This reduces the risk of data breaches during transit or storageÂ¹.

2. **Network Integration**: A WipeOS appliance can be easily integrated into your existing Local Area Network (LAN). This allows you to sanitize multiple devices simultaneously, making the process more efficient.

3. **Compliance and Reporting**: The appliance provides detailed logs and reports, which can be accessed through a secure online portal. This helps in maintaining compliance with data protection regulations and provides proof of data destruction.

4. **Versatility**: It supports various wiping standards (1-pass, 3-pass, 7-pass) to meet different security requirements. Additionally, it can be used with a USB stick if network integration is not feasible.

5. **Cost-Effective**: By wiping and reselling drives instead of physically destroying them, organizations can maximize the value of their IT assets.
