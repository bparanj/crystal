Got it! Yes, you can replace a WipeOS appliance with a ThinkPad running ShredOS. Here are some considerations for making this switch:

1. **Functionality**: ShredOS on a ThinkPad can perform the same secure data wiping tasks as a WipeOS appliance. It supports various wiping standards and provides detailed logs of the wiping process.

2. **Portability**: A ThinkPad is portable, allowing you to move it easily between different locations or devices that need wiping. This can be more convenient than a fixed appliance.

3. **Cost**: Using an existing ThinkPad with ShredOS can be more cost-effective than purchasing a dedicated WipeOS appliance, especially if you already have the hardware.

4. **Flexibility**: ShredOS can be booted from a USB drive, making it easy to set up and use on different machines. This flexibility can be advantageous if you need to wipe multiple devices in different environments.

5. **Integration**: While a dedicated appliance might offer more seamless integration with networked environments, a ThinkPad with ShredOS can still be integrated into your workflow with some additional setup.
