Software community has always been very skeptical regarding using TRIZ for software development. They
might indeed have a point because, besides TRIZ for software be on its very childhood, TRIZ was not conceived with information systems in mind. Moreover, it seems that TRIZ application on software development has been targeted to solve problems that are not on the radar of software developers during software
creation. As software complexity increases with computer capacity, current software development methodologies target an ideal software result and focus their attention on processes to manage the complexities
related to resource allocation. Therefore, at the development phase of the software lifecycle, usually, there
are no contradictions that could benefit from TRIZ to be solved. On the other hand, once a software is running, there are very few or no methods to guide on how to evolve it systematically. Propose an approach to apply TRIZ’s Trends of Evolution to guide the software developer to evolve their systems.

Let's propose an approach to apply TRIZ's Trends of Evolution for software evolution, addressing the concerns raised:

**Approach**

1. **Shifting Focus from Idealization to Evolution:**  Acknowledge the goal of current development methodologies is an 'ideal' initial release. Move away from focusing on solving immediate contradictions towards  a system capable of continuous, strategic evolution.

2. **Mapping TRIZ Trends to Software Realms:** Interpret TRIZ Trends of Evolution with software design patterns and architecture to provide meaningful guidance:

    * **Trend: Increased Dynamism & Controllability**
       * **Software Equivalent:**  Modularization, loose coupling, microservices. This leads to greater flexibility in updating and changing smaller components independently.
    * **Trend: Increased Segmentation** 
       * **Software Equivalent:**  Decomposition of  services for more fine-grained scaling and evolution based on usage patterns.
    * **Trend: Evolution Towards Ideality**
       * **Software Equivalent:**  This is tricky because 'ideal' software is subjective. Emphasize refactoring for non-functional requirements: efficiency, maintainability, or scalability. 
    * **Trend:  Transition to the Super-System**
        * **Software Equivalent:** Integration with larger systems and ecosystems, APIs as service endpoints, modular plugins.

3. **Proactive Evolution Planning:** Embed the consideration of evolutionary capability into the design  phase:

    * **Anticipate Change:** Identify areas likely to face new requirements or usage patterns. Design those with greater dynamism in mind. 
    * **Evolvability Metrics:** Define metrics that capture maintainability, code complexity, or coupling during development. Tie these to decisions about architectural changes.

4. **Evolutionary Problem Solving:** Use TRIZ when systems have been in operation for some time and face more concrete obstacles that hinder  progression:

   * **Functional Analysis:** Model existing software system functions and components for areas where contradictions emerge.  
   * **Trimming:** Simplify system areas as allowed without hindering the existing  purpose, often a good prelude to later extension. 

**Example Scenario**

Let's say a monolithic e-commerce system has performance bottlenecks as traffic grows. 

* **Evolutionary Planning:** The initial architecture likely wasn't designed with the flexibility and performance for the current use in mind.  Proactively refactor by decomposing into microservices like customer authentication,  catalog, search, and checkout.  
* **Trend Identification:** This aligns with the Trend of Segmentation  allowing each independent piece to  handle scaling demands as needed. 
* **Evolutionary Problem Solving:** If scaling even within decomposed  components is hampered by a shared database, apply trimming - denormalizing data where acceptable to enhance isolated services, and apply TRIZ to deal with more specific system constraints of individual functionalities.

**Additional Considerations**

* **Tool Support:** Research tools attempting to bridge TRIZ into  software (Goldfire and similar), but focus on the essence of the evolutionary trends more than strict software tool support. 
* **Experimentation:** An evolutionary approach benefits from feedback loops like A/B testing different refactorings for impact.

This approach acknowledges the limitations of direct TRIZ application on greenfield projects while emphasizing  its value in guiding long-term, strategic system design and problem-solving. Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into a specific Trend of Evolution or an illustrative example. 

Applying TRIZ's Trends of Evolution to software development involves a creative approach, as TRIZ originates from a mechanical engineering perspective. However, the core idea of TRIZ — solving problems by resolving contradictions and following a set of evolution patterns — can be very useful in the software domain, especially for guiding systematic evolution of software systems. Here's a structured approach to adapt and apply TRIZ’s Trends of Evolution in software development:

### Understand TRIZ's Trends of Evolution
First, we need to grasp the essence of TRIZ's Trends of Evolution. These trends describe how systems evolve over time towards increasing ideality, through stages of development characterized by solving contradictions. In software, these trends can be related to aspects like modularity, scalability, maintainability, and usability.

### Identify Analogous Trends in Software
Translate the mechanical or physical trends into software development contexts. For example:
- **Increasing Dynamization**: Software systems can evolve from rigid architectures to more flexible, service-oriented architectures (SOAs) or microservices, adapting more dynamically to changing requirements.
- **Increasing Ideality**: Software evolution aims to increase functionality while reducing complexity, bugs, and resource consumption.
- **Transition to the Super-System**: Software components increasingly integrate with external systems and services, expanding their ecosystem.

### Map Software Development Challenges to TRIZ Contradictions
Identify contradictions in software development, such as the need for high performance versus low resource consumption, or the desire for rapid development versus the need for high-quality code. Use TRIZ methodology to find innovative solutions for these contradictions.

### Use TRIZ to Guide Systematic Evolution
- **Problem Formulation**: Clearly define the problem or the need for evolution in the software system. This could be a performance bottleneck, user experience issue, or adaptability to new requirements.
- **Contradiction Analysis**: Identify the contradictions that prevent solving the problem using current methods.
- **Application of Trends**: Apply the analogous TRIZ trends to propose evolutionary steps. For instance, if the software needs to evolve to handle more load dynamically, consider applying the trend of increasing dynamization by introducing scalable cloud services or containerization.

### Develop a Framework for Continuous Evolution
Create a framework that systematically applies TRIZ's Trends of Evolution in the software lifecycle. This framework should include:
- **Regular Analysis**: Periodically review software systems to identify potential areas for application of TRIZ trends.
- **Evolutionary Roadmap**: Develop a roadmap that outlines how the software will evolve, incorporating TRIZ trends to resolve contradictions and achieve higher levels of ideality.
- **Feedback Loops**: Implement mechanisms to gather user and system feedback to inform continuous evolution of the software.

### Conclusion
By translating TRIZ's Trends of Evolution into the software development context, developers can gain a structured method for evolving software systems systematically. This approach encourages innovation by focusing on solving contradictions and applying patterns of evolution, leading to more ideal software solutions over time. It bridges the gap between traditional software development methodologies and the need for continuous adaptation and improvement in the face of growing system complexity and changing requirements.
