What is a technical system?

A technical system is anything that performs a function, such as cars, pens, books, and knives.

Why is it called a technical system?

It is called a technical system because it is a system that has been designed and built to perform a specific technical function. Technical systems can be simple or complex, and can be used in a wide variety of applications. Some common examples of technical systems include cars, computers, and medical equipment.

The term "technical system" is often used in the context of engineering and design, as it can help to describe the overall function and purpose of a system. By understanding the technical system, engineers and designers can better understand how to improve and optimize the system's performance.

What is a contradiction?

A contradiction is a statement or proposition that is both true and false at the same time. Contradictions can arise in many different ways, such as when two different statements are both true, or when a statement is true in one context but false in another.

Contradictions can be frustrating and confusing, but they can also be a source of creativity and innovation. By exploring contradictions, we can often find new ways of thinking about problems and come up with new solutions.

In the context of TRIZ, contradictions are often used to describe the technical problems that need to be solved. For example, a contradiction might be that a system needs to be both strong and lightweight. This contradiction can be resolved by finding a material that is both strong and lightweight, or by designing the system in a way that makes it strong without adding too much weight.

Contradictions can also be used to generate new ideas. For example, if you are trying to come up with a new product, you can start by thinking about contradictions that exist in the current market. Once you have identified a contradiction, you can then try to come up with a solution that resolves the contradiction.

Here are some examples of contradictions:

A car that is both fuel-efficient and powerful.
A computer that is both fast and inexpensive.
A phone that is both waterproof and lightweight.
These contradictions can be challenging to solve, but they can also lead to new and innovative products and technologies.

What is a technical contradiction

A technical contradiction is a situation in which two or more requirements for a technical system are in conflict with each other. This can make it difficult or impossible to design a system that meets all of the requirements.

For example, a designer might be tasked with creating a car that is both fuel-efficient and powerful. These two requirements are in conflict with each other, because making a car more fuel-efficient  means making it less powerful.

Technical contradictions can be resolved in a number of ways, such as:

Finding a new technology or material that allows for both requirements to be met.
Compromising on one or both of the requirements.
Finding a way to separate the conflicting requirements in time or space.
TRIZ provides a number of tools and techniques for resolving technical contradictions. These tools and techniques can help designers to find new and innovative solutions to problems.

Here are some examples of technical contradictions:

A car that is both lightweight and durable.
A computer that is both fast and inexpensive.
A phone that is both waterproof and durable.
These contradictions can be difficult to solve, but they can also lead to new and innovative products and technologies.

Why is it called technical contradiction

A technical contradiction is called a technical contradiction because it is a contradiction that arises in the context of a technical system. Technical systems are systems that have been designed and built to perform a specific technical function.

Technical contradictions can arise for a number of reasons, such as:

The laws of physics may conflict with each other. For example, it is impossible to design a car that is both infinitely fast and infinitely fuel-efficient, because the laws of physics dictate that faster cars require more fuel.
The requirements of the user may conflict with each other. For example, a user may want a car that is both powerful and fuel-efficient, but these two requirements are in conflict with each other.
The limitations of available materials and technologies may conflict with the desired function of the system. For example, it may be impossible to design a car that is both lightweight and durable, because the materials that are available are not strong enough to withstand the forces that the car will be subjected to.
Technical contradictions can be frustrating and challenging to solve, but they can also lead to new and innovative solutions. By understanding the technical contradictions that exist in a system, engineers and designers can better understand how to improve and optimize the system's performance.

Here are some examples of technical contradictions:

A car that is both fuel-efficient and powerful.
A computer that is both fast and inexpensive.
A phone that is both waterproof and lightweight.
These contradictions can be challenging to solve, but they can also lead to new and innovative products and technologies.

What is physical contradiction

A physical contradiction is a contradiction that arises from the laws of physics. Physical contradictions are often impossible to resolve, because they are based on fundamental principles of the universe.

For example, it is a physical contradiction to say that an object can be both in two places at the same time and not in two places at the same time. This is because the laws of physics dictate that an object can only be in one place at a time.

Another example of a physical contradiction is to say that an object can be both moving and not moving at the same time. This is because the laws of physics dictate that an object can only be either moving or not moving at any given time.

Physical contradictions can be frustrating and challenging to understand, but they can also lead to new and innovative discoveries. By understanding the physical contradictions that exist in the universe, scientists and engineers can better understand how the universe works and how to develop new technologies.

Here are some examples of physical contradictions:

An object can be both in two places at the same time and not in two places at the same time.
An object can be both moving and not moving at the same time.
An object can be both a wave and a particle at the same time.
These contradictions are based on fundamental principles of the universe, and they are impossible to resolve. However, they can lead to new and innovative discoveries, such as the development of quantum mechanics.

Explain Evolution of Technical Systems

The Evolution of Technical Systems (ETS) is a theory developed by Genrich Altshuller that describes the patterns of evolution that technical systems follow over time. Altshuller identified eight main patterns of evolution:

Life cycle: Technical systems evolve through a life cycle, from inception to growth, maturity, and decline.
Dynamization: Technical systems tend to become more dynamic and flexible over time.
Multiplication: Technical systems tend to multiply, or become more complex, over time.
Transition from macro to micro level: Technical systems tend to transition from a macro level to a micro level over time.
Synchronization: Technical systems tend to become more synchronized with each other over time.
Scaling up or down: Technical systems tend to scale up or down in size over time.
Uneven development of parts: Different parts of a technical system tend to develop at different rates over time.
Replacement of human (Automation): Technical systems tend to replace human labor over time.
These patterns of evolution can be seen in a wide variety of technical systems, from simple tools to complex machines. For example, the life cycle of a car begins when it is designed and built. The car then goes through a period of growth as it is used and maintained. Eventually, the car reaches maturity and begins to decline as it becomes less reliable and efficient. Finally, the car is replaced by a new car.

The patterns of evolution that technical systems follow can be used to predict the future development of these systems. For example, we can predict that cars will become more dynamic and flexible in the future, and that they will become more integrated with other systems, such as the internet.

The ETS is a powerful tool that can be used to understand the evolution of technical systems and to predict their future development. This tool can be used by engineers, designers, and other professionals to develop new and innovative products and technologies.

Here are some examples of the Evolution of Technical Systems in action:

The first cars were large and ?, and they were powered by steam engines. Over time, cars became smaller, lighter, and more efficient. They also transitioned from steam engines to internal combustion engines and then to electric motors.
The first computers were large and expensive, and they could only perform a limited number of tasks. Over time, computers have become smaller, cheaper, and more powerful. They can now perform a wide variety of tasks, from word processing to video editing.
The first airplanes were made of wood and fabric, and they could only fly for a short period of time. Over time, airplanes have become larger, faster, and more efficient. They can now fly for long distances and carry large payloads.
The Evolution of Technical Systems is a continuous process, and it is likely that we will see even more dramatic changes in the future.

Why is it called physical contradiction?

A physical contradiction is called a physical contradiction because it is a contradiction that arises from the laws of physics. Physical contradictions are based on fundamental principles of the universe, such as the laws of thermodynamics, the laws of motion, and the laws of quantum mechanics.

These laws dictate how the universe works, and they cannot be violated. Therefore, any statement that contradicts a law of physics is a physical contradiction.

For example, the statement "An object can be in two places at the same time" is a physical contradiction, because it violates the law of conservation of energy. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, and it must always be conserved. If an object could be in two places at the same time, then it would have to have twice as much energy as it does when it is in one place. This would violate the law of conservation of energy.

Another example of a physical contradiction is the statement "An object can travel faster than the speed of light." This statement violates the laws of relativity, which state that the speed of light is the maximum speed at which anything can travel.

Physical contradictions can be frustrating and challenging to understand, but they can also lead to new and innovative discoveries. By understanding the physical contradictions that exist in the universe, scientists and engineers can better understand how the universe works and how to develop new technologies.

Here are some examples of physical contradictions:

An object can be both in two places at the same time and not in two places at the same time.
An object can be both moving and not moving at the same time.
An object can be both a wave and a particle at the same time.
An object can travel faster than the speed of light.
These contradictions are based on fundamental principles of the universe, and they are impossible to resolve. However, they can lead to new and innovative discoveries, such as the development of quantum mechanics.

What is an example of a function performed by a technical system

A function is a specific action or task that a technical system is designed to perform. Functions can be simple or complex, and they can be performed by a wide variety of technical systems.

Here are some examples of functions performed by technical systems:

Transportation: Cars, trains, airplanes, and other vehicles transport people and goods from one place to another.
Communication: Telephones, computers, and other communication devices allow people to communicate with each other over long distances.
Energy production: Power plants, solar panels, and other energy production systems generate electricity and other forms of energy.
Manufacturing: Robots, CNC machines, and other manufacturing systems produce goods and products.
Healthcare: Medical devices, imaging systems, and other healthcare systems help to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries.
These are just a few examples of the many different functions that technical systems can perform. Technical systems play a vital role in our everyday lives, and they are constantly evolving to meet new needs and challenges.

Here are some more specific examples of functions performed by technical systems:

A car engine converts the chemical energy of gasoline into mechanical energy, which is used to power the car.
A computer processes data and performs calculations.
A power plant generates electricity by converting the energy of coal, natural gas, or other fuels into electrical energy.
A robot assembles products by performing a series of precise movements.
A medical imaging system creates images of the inside of the body, which can be used to diagnose and treat diseases.
Technical systems are all around us, and they play a vital role in our everyday lives. By understanding the functions that technical systems perform, we can better understand how the world around us works.

What is an example for the simplest technical system

The simplest technical system consists of two elements with energy passing from one element to the other.

For example, a simple lever is a technical system that consists of a rigid bar pivoted on a fixed point. When force is applied to one end of the lever, it causes the other end of the lever to move. The energy that is applied to one end of the lever is transferred to the other end of the lever, causing it to move.

Another example of a simple technical system is a pulley. A pulley is a wheel with a grooved rim around which a rope or cable can pass. When a force is applied to one end of the rope or cable, it causes the pulley to rotate. The energy that is applied to one end of the rope or cable is transferred to the other end of the rope or cable, causing it to move.

These are just two examples of simple technical systems. There are many other simple technical systems that can be found in everyday life, such as scissors, pliers, and screwdrivers.

Here is another example of a simple technical system:

A ball rolling down a hill. The ball is the first element, and the hill is the second element. The energy that is stored in the ball as potential energy is transferred to the ball as kinetic energy as the ball rolls down the hill.
Simple technical systems are the building blocks of more complex technical systems. By understanding how simple technical systems work, we can better understand how more complex technical systems work.

What is the difference between conventional engineering and TRIZ

Conventional engineering is the traditional approach to engineering design. It involves using known principles and methods to solve problems and design new products and technologies. TRIZ, on the other hand, is a more innovative approach to engineering design. It involves using a set of tools and techniques to identify and resolve contradictions, and to generate new and innovative solutions to problems.

One of the key differences between conventional engineering and TRIZ is the way that they approach problems. Conventional engineering  starts with a problem and then tries to find a solution. TRIZ, on the other hand, starts by identifying the contradictions that are inherent in the problem. Once the contradictions have been identified, TRIZ then uses a set of tools and techniques to resolve the contradictions and generate new and innovative solutions.

Another key difference between conventional engineering and TRIZ is the way that they generate solutions. Conventional engineering  generates solutions by brainstorming and trial and error. TRIZ, on the other hand, uses a set of tools and techniques to generate solutions that are based on the laws of physics and the principles of inventive problem solving.

TRIZ is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. It is useful for solving problems that are complex and have multiple contradictions. TRIZ can also be used to generate new and innovative solutions to problems that have not been solved before.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between conventional engineering and TRIZ:

Characteristic	Conventional Engineering	TRIZ
Approach to problems	Starts with a problem and then tries to find a solution	Starts by identifying the contradictions that are inherent in the problem
Way of generating solutions	Brainstorming and trial and error	Uses a set of tools and techniques to generate solutions that are based on the laws of physics and the principles of inventive problem solving
Types of problems that can be solved	Simple problems with few contradictions	Complex problems with multiple contradictions
Ability to generate new and innovative solutions	Limited	High
TRIZ is a valuable tool for engineers and designers who want to solve problems in a more innovative and efficient way. TRIZ can help engineers and designers to generate new and innovative solutions to problems that have not been solved before, and to improve the performance of existing products and technologies.

What is a subsystem for a technical system

A subsystem is a component of a larger system that performs a specific function. Subsystems can be interconnected in a variety of ways to form a more complex system.

For example, a car is a complex technical system that is made up of a number of subsystems, such as the engine, the transmission, the brakes, and the steering system. Each of these subsystems performs a specific function that is necessary for the overall operation of the car.

Subsystems can be further divided into smaller subsystems. For example, the engine subsystem of a car can be divided into the following subsystems:

The engine block
The crankshaft
The pistons
The valves
The camshaft
Each of these subsystems performs a specific function that is necessary for the overall operation of the engine.

Subsystems can also be interconnected in a variety of ways. For example, the engine subsystem of a car is connected to the transmission subsystem via the driveshaft. The transmission subsystem is connected to the brakes subsystem via the brake lines. The steering subsystem is connected to the wheels via the steering column.

The interconnectedness of subsystems is what makes complex technical systems possible. By combining a number of subsystems, each of which performs a specific function, engineers can create systems that are capable of performing complex tasks.

Here are some other examples of subsystems:

The electrical system of a house is a subsystem that provides power to the house.
The plumbing system of a house is a subsystem that provides water to the house.
The heating and cooling system of a house is a subsystem that regulates the temperature of the house.
Subsystems are an essential part of complex technical systems. By understanding the subsystems that make up a system, we can better understand how the system works and how to improve its performance.

To identify the subsystems for a given technical system, you can use the following steps:

Identify the main function of the system. This is the overall purpose of the system.
Break the system down into smaller components. These components should be able to perform specific functions that contribute to the overall function of the system.
Identify the interconnections between the components. These interconnections should show how the components work together to perform the overall function of the system.
Group the components into subsystems. Subsystems should be groups of components that perform related functions.
Here is an example of how to identify the subsystems for a car:

The main function of a car is to transport people and goods.
The components of a car include the engine, the transmission, the brakes, the steering system, and the wheels.
The engine converts the chemical energy of gasoline into mechanical energy, which is used to power the car. The transmission transfers the power from the engine to the wheels. The brakes slow down or stop the car. The steering system allows the driver to control the direction of the car. The wheels support the car and allow it to move.
The components of a car can be grouped into the following subsystems:
The engine subsystem includes the engine, the crankshaft, the pistons, the valves, and the camshaft.
The transmission subsystem includes the transmission, the driveshaft, and the differential.
The brakes subsystem includes the brake pads, the brake rotors, and the brake lines.
The steering subsystem includes the steering wheel, the steering column, and the steering rack.
The wheels subsystem includes the wheels, the tires, and the suspension.
By following these steps, you can identify the subsystems for any given technical system. Understanding the subsystems that make up a system can help you to better understand how the system works and how to improve its performance.

## GPT

A technical system is defined as anything that performs a function, encompassing a broad range of entities from simple tools to complex machinery. Examples include cars, pens, and books. Such systems can be made up of one or more subsystems, with each subsystem being a technical system in its own right, contributing to the overall function of the larger system. This hierarchical organization extends from very simple systems with only two elements to highly complex systems with many interacting elements.

It is called a technical system because it refers specifically to systems designed to achieve practical objectives through the application of scientific and engineering knowledge. Technical systems encompass devices, tools, machines, and other engineered solutions created to perform specific functions or solve particular problems, distinguishing them from natural or social systems which may not involve deliberate human design or technological components. This term emphasizes the technical and engineered nature of these systems, highlighting their purposeful construction and utilization to meet human needs and goals.

A contradiction, as described in the context of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), occurs when attempting to improve one characteristic or parameter of a technical system leads to the deterioration of another characteristic or parameter within the same system. This situation often leads to seeking compromise solutions because improving one aspect negatively impacts another, creating a conflict or contradiction between desired improvements.

TRIZ identifies two types of contradictions:

1. **Technical Contradictions**: These occur when improving one parameter of a system causes a degradation in another parameter. For example, increasing the power of an engine might necessitate making the engine larger, which could be undesirable for reasons of space or weight.

2. **Physical Contradictions**: These arise when two opposite conditions or properties are required from the same element or system at the same time. An example is the need for an airplane's landing gear to be present for landing and takeoff but absent (retracted) during flight to reduce air drag.

The resolution of these contradictions, without resorting to compromise, is central to TRIZ methodology. TRIZ provides strategies, such as the 40 Inventive Principles and the separation principles for physical contradictions, to systematically address and resolve these conflicts, aiming for an ideal solution where the benefits are maximized while the negatives are minimized or eliminated.

A technical contradiction in TRIZ occurs when attempting to improve one characteristic or parameter of a technical system results in the deterioration of another characteristic or parameter within the same system. These contradictions are inherent to the design and function of technical systems and often lead to the need for compromise solutions. Technical contradictions are identified by analyzing the specific parameters of a system that are in conflict when an attempt is made to enhance a particular aspect of the system. The TRIZ methodology uses the 40 Inventive Principles as a toolkit to resolve these technical contradictions by suggesting systematic ways to overcome the conflict without compromising. These principles provide innovative strategies for breaking the contradiction, allowing for the improvement of one parameter without negatively affecting another.

It is called a "technical contradiction" because this type of contradiction specifically arises within the context of technical systems or engineering, where an attempt to improve one technical aspect or parameter inadvertently causes a deterioration in another. The term "technical" emphasizes that the contradiction is related to the technical characteristics, parameters, or performance metrics of a system, as opposed to contradictions that might be purely theoretical, conceptual, or related to non-technical domains.

Technical contradictions are a key focus in problem-solving methodologies like TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), which seeks to systematically address and resolve these contradictions without compromise. In TRIZ, identifying and overcoming technical contradictions is crucial for innovation and improving the design and functionality of technical systems, products, or processes.

A physical contradiction in TRIZ arises when two opposite properties or conditions are required from the same element of a technical system or from the technical system itself. Unlike technical contradictions, which involve a conflict between two different parameters or characteristics of a system, physical contradictions demand that an element or system simultaneously meet mutually exclusive requirements. This type of contradiction highlights the need for a system or component to exist in two contradictory states at the same time.

To resolve physical contradictions, TRIZ suggests employing strategies such as separating the contradictory requirements in time or space, changing the physical state of a substance, or using other creative methods to satisfy both requirements without compromise. Examples provided include making airplane landing gear retractable to meet the need for being both present (for landing and takeoff) and absent (during flight to reduce air drag), or saturating water with air bubbles for high water diving, making it "hard" enough to support the diver and "soft" enough to prevent injury.

Physical contradictions drive innovation by challenging designers and engineers to think beyond conventional compromise solutions, seeking inventive ways to fulfill opposing demands within a single system.

The Evolution of Technical Systems in TRIZ is detailed through eight Patterns or Lines of Evolution as established by Genrich Altshuller. These patterns describe the general trends and stages through which technical systems develop over time, becoming more complex, efficient, and adaptive. Here's a brief overview of each pattern:

1. **Life Cycle**: Every technical system goes through a lifecycle from inception, through growth and maturity, to decline and eventual obsolescence.

2. **Dynamization**: Technical systems evolve towards increased dynamism and adaptability. Initially rigid systems become more flexible, acquiring joints and eventually becoming fully adaptable to changes in their environment or operational conditions.

3. **Multiplication Cycle**: Systems evolve by first simplifying and then becoming more complex through the addition of similar (homogeneous multiplication) or different (heterogeneous multiplication) elements, leading to new properties or functionalities.

4. **Transition from Macro to Micro Level**: Technical systems evolve from using macro-level mechanisms to micro-level or even nano-level mechanisms, leveraging the properties of materials at smaller scales for enhanced performance and capabilities.

5. **Synchronization**: The evolution towards better coordination and synchronization within a system, ensuring that all parts work together in the most efficient manner.

6. **Scaling Up or Down**: Technical systems evolve by changing in size, either scaling up to handle more extensive operations or scaling down to become more compact and efficient.

7. **Uneven Development of Parts**: In any technical system, some components evolve faster than others, leading to a temporary imbalance that drives further innovation to harmonize the system.

8. **Replacement of Human (Automation)**: Over time, technical systems evolve to automate functions previously performed by humans, leading to increased efficiency, precision, and reliability.

These patterns illustrate the inherent drive towards greater ideality in technical systems, where ideality is defined by the system's ability to perform the desired functions with minimal negative consequences, resource usage, and complexity. Understanding these evolutionary patterns helps innovators predict future developments, identify opportunities for breakthrough innovations, and solve technical problems by aligning their solutions with the natural evolution of technical systems.

It is called a "physical contradiction" in TRIZ because this concept refers to a situation where a single element of a technical system, or the system itself, is required to exhibit two opposite properties or states simultaneously to fulfill a function or solve a problem. This type of contradiction directly addresses the physical state or properties of a component or system, making it distinct from technical contradictions, which involve conflicts between different system parameters or characteristics.

For example, a physical contradiction might be that an airplane's landing gear needs to be present for takeoff and landing but absent (retracted) during flight to reduce air drag. The contradiction is "physical" because it involves the direct physical presence and absence of the same component under different conditions. 

The resolution of physical contradictions often involves creative strategies such as separating contradictory requirements in time or space, changing the physical state of a substance, or using fields to achieve the desired outcomes without compromising. This emphasizes the inherent physical nature of the contradiction and the inventive thinking required to overcome such contradictions in technical systems.

An example of a function performed by a technical system is the automatic opening and closing of greenhouse windows based on outside temperature. This system involves a temperature-sensitive bimetallic spiral mechanism that responds to temperature changes. When the outside temperature is low, the windows close to retain warmth. When it's hot, the windows open to allow for better ventilation. This technical system enhances the greenhouse environment's control, optimizing conditions for plant growth without manual intervention.

In TRIZ, the simplest technical system is described as consisting of two elements with energy passing from one element to the other. An illustrative example of such a system is chalk and a blackboard. When mechanical force (energy) is applied to the chalk, causing it to interact with the blackboard, it becomes functional — enabling the writing process. Here, the chalk and the blackboard are each considered independent technical systems, but when combined with the action of writing (applying force), they create a functional technical system for communication.

This conceptualization emphasizes that at its most fundamental level, a technical system requires at least two interacting elements and an exchange of energy to perform a function. This framework helps in understanding how even the most complex technical systems can be broken down into simpler subsystems, each contributing to the overall function in a specific way.

The document does not explicitly compare conventional engineering to TRIZ, but based on the principles and philosophy of TRIZ, we can infer key differences between conventional engineering approaches and TRIZ:

1. **Problem Solving Approach**:
   - **Conventional Engineering**: Often relies on domain-specific knowledge, experience, and iterative trial and error. Solutions are  sought within the context of existing technology and knowledge within a specific field.
   - **TRIZ**: Uses a systematic and theory-based approach to problem-solving. TRIZ abstracts the problem from its specific context and applies principles derived from the study of patterns in technology evolution, aiming to find innovative solutions across industries.

2. **Dealing with Contradictions**:
   - **Conventional Engineering**: Contradictions or conflicts in design requirements are often resolved through compromise, optimizing one parameter at the expense of another.
   - **TRIZ**: Emphasizes the resolution of contradictions without compromise by applying inventive principles and patterns that have been identified through the analysis of thousands of patents. TRIZ seeks to elevate the solution to a level where the contradiction no longer exists.

3. **Innovation Levels**:
   - **Conventional Engineering**: Innovations are often incremental, focusing on improving existing solutions or technologies.
   - **TRIZ**: Categorizes innovations into five levels, from simple improvements to revolutionary discoveries that involve new principles or phenomena. TRIZ aims to facilitate breakthrough innovations by systematically overcoming technical and physical contradictions.

4. **Resource Utilization**:
   - **Conventional Engineering**: May not systematically explore the use of available resources within and outside the system.
   - **TRIZ**: Strongly focuses on the ideality of a system, which involves maximizing the use of available resources and minimizing harmful effects. This approach encourages looking beyond the immediate system to find simple, elegant solutions.

5. **Ideality and System Evolution**:
   - **Conventional Engineering**: Focuses on specific goals and objectives without necessarily considering the ultimate ideal state of the system.
   - **TRIZ**: Introduces the concept of system evolution and ideality, suggesting that all technical systems evolve towards increasing ideality over time. TRIZ provides tools for predicting the future development of systems based on patterns of evolution.

In summary, while conventional engineering often relies on domain-specific knowledge and compromise solutions, TRIZ offers a structured, principle-based approach aimed at eliminating contradictions and achieving ideality. TRIZ encourages looking beyond conventional wisdom to find innovative solutions that work within the broader context of system evolution and resource utilization.

A subsystem for a technical system is a component or a smaller system within a larger technical system that performs its own specific function while contributing to the overall function of the entire system. An example provided is the relationship between a car and its components: a car consists of several subsystems like the engine, steering mechanism, brakes, and so on. Each of these subsystems is a technical system in itself, with its own series of subsystems, and each performs a distinct function that contributes to the operation and functionality of the car as a whole. This hierarchical structure demonstrates how complex technical systems are composed of interconnected subsystems, each playing a critical role in the system's performance and capabilities.

To identify a subsystem for a given technical system, one can follow the hierarchical organization of technical systems as outlined in TRIZ. This process involves understanding that a technical system can be decomposed into its constituent parts or subsystems, each of which performs its own specific function within the larger system. Here's a general approach based on TRIZ principles:

1. **Define the Overall System**: Start by clearly defining the technical system you are analyzing. Understand its main function or purpose.

2. **Identify Major Functions**: List out the major functions required to achieve the overall system's purpose. This step helps in breaking down the system into functional components.

3. **Determine Subsystems**: For each major function, identify the subsystem or component that performs this function within the larger system. A subsystem can be recognized as a smaller, self-contained unit within the larger system that contributes to the overall functionality.

4. **Analyze Hierarchical Levels**: Recognize that subsystems themselves can be broken down into smaller subsystems. This hierarchical analysis can continue down to very simple systems with only two elements, reflecting the complexity and interconnectivity within the technical system.

5. **Consider Interconnections**: Understand how these subsystems are interconnected and interact with each other within the bounds of the higher system. Changes or improvements in one subsystem can have implications for other subsystems and the overall system performance.

An example provided in the document is the technical system "Car," which is composed of subsystems like the "Power train," "Brakes," and "Brake pedal." Each of these subsystems, in turn, can be further decomposed; for example, the "Brake" system includes "Brake pad Assembly" and "Pad," demonstrating the nested hierarchy of subsystems within a technical system.

This approach emphasizes the systematic decomposition of a technical system into its functional components and the understanding of their interrelations, which is crucial for analyzing, improving, or innovating within technical systems according to TRIZ methodology.
