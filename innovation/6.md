The 40 Inventive Principles are one of the best known and most used tools of TRIZ. Originally, the 40 Inventive Principles were focused on solving problems of physics and chemistry. Caused by the increasing impact of software solutions, there were some activities in searching for analogies of the 40 Principles in software environments since the year 2000. Unfortunately, these efforts only had limited success. TRIZ and software is a difficult topic until today.
Take a look at past searches for software analogies of the 40 Principles. As a result, the creation of analogies is regarded as very useful. In the past, the analogies were limited to one-to-one transfers and new examples for the existing 40 Principles. But information technology is very different from physics and chemistry. This causes lateral thinking to be necessary when applying the current analogies of the Inventive Principles, thus often reducing quality and number of the ideas found. For avoiding lateral thinking, the transfer of the Inventive Principles to information technology has to be done in a more flexible way. For achieving this objective, information technology is separated into its three characteristics: objects, data, and algorithms. In the first step, each original Principle is applied to each of these three characteristics. Then, all results are put together. In the second step, the found results are put back into groups based on the original Principles. Thereby, groups are created, dropped, modified, or split. Thus, the new groups can be very different in comparison to the original Inventive Principles. Finally, the groups are turned into Inventive Principles for information technology.

Here's a breakdown of your analysis and insights, followed by how we can refine the approach to Inventive Principles for software:

**Key Points**

* **TRIZ's Origins:** You correctly highlight TRIZ's roots in physical domains leading to challenges in direct software application.
* **Limited Success of Analogies:** Existing efforts often focused on forced one-to-one mappings, leading to strained interpretations and hindering ideation.
* **Characteristics of IT:**  Your focus on objects, data, and algorithms provides a useful decomposition of the software domain.
* **Flexible Principles:** You rightfully propose restructuring principles rather than relying on rigid translation to create more fitting IT principles.

**Refining the Methodology**

Your suggested  two-step process holds promise:

1. **Principle Deconstruction:**
   * Apply each original principle to 'objects', 'data', and 'algorithms'. This forces us out of a physical solution bias, towards  how contradictions/problems manifest within these core building blocks of software.
   * **Extra Step:** It might be worth going even finer  than the proposed structure within these buckets.  Thinking about sub-elements within object-oriented systems like the object itself, attributes of the object, and functions, or the structure, state, and transformation of data could provide more angles. 

2. **Principle Recomposition:** 
    * The grouping process is where flexibility and novel connections can emerge. It allows us to shed the constraint of 40 precise principles.   
    * Here,  consider how themes across software issues might cluster: performance, user experience, security, and such – rather than strictly mapping back to a pre-set list. 

**Example (Illustrative)** 

Let's take Principle #1 (Segmentation) and work this sketch of the method:

* **Objects:** Modular code, microservices, domain-driven decompositions.
* **Data:**  Normalized database models, sharding (distribution), structured vs. unstructured data.
* **Algorithms:**  Breaking complex procedures into smaller functions, divide-and-conquer paradigms, steps in a multi-step workflow

We already  see patterns suggesting new groups could  emerge, perhaps centered around:

* **Granularity Principles:** Covering objects at various levels, data  schemas, and algorithmic steps.
* **Distribution Principles:** Dealing with how to segment objects across services, partition data, and parallelize processing.

**Considerations**

* **Design Patterns:** Resulting principle groupings might resemble best practices within domains like architecture or data. This reinforces the translation as practical.
* **Problem Driven:** Working from a  'real world' software contradiction should validate this. We'll see if generated principle variants help.  

**This flexible method presents a powerful evolution in applying TRIZ to software. Let's collaborate – would you like to continue with a few more original principles within this structure, or discuss how this aligns with current trends in software engineering?**

The approach to transferring TRIZ's 40 Inventive Principles to the field of software development, given the unique challenges and characteristics of information technology, involves a two-step process that starts with the separation of IT into its three foundational components: objects, data, and algorithms. This method acknowledges the distinct nature of software compared to physical sciences and aims to provide a more direct and effective application of TRIZ principles. Here's a breakdown of how this process could be conceptualized and implemented:

### Step 1: Apply Original Principles to Software Components
#### Objects (Software Architecture and Components)
- Examine how each TRIZ principle can influence the design, structure, and interaction of software components, such as classes, modules, and services. For instance, the principle of "Segmentation" might lead to designing modular microservices instead of a monolithic architecture.

#### Data (Storage, Retrieval, and Flow)
- Consider how data is managed, stored, retrieved, and manipulated within systems. Applying the principle of "Taking out" could involve optimizing data storage by removing redundant data or decomposing a large database into more efficient, purpose-specific data stores.

#### Algorithms (Processes and Logic)
- Explore the application of principles to the algorithms that drive software behavior, including logic, decision-making processes, and computational methods. The principle of "Dynamics" might inspire adaptive algorithms that adjust parameters based on runtime data or user input.

### Step 2: Reorganize Principles Based on Software Context
After individually applying the original principles to objects, data, and algorithms, the next step is to analyze the results and reorganize them into new groups that reflect the specific needs and realities of software development. This reorganization process may involve:

#### Creating New Groups
- Some findings might not fit neatly into the original 40 principles but are significant for software development. These can form new groups that address specific software innovation challenges, such as usability, scalability, or security.

#### Dropping Irrelevant Groups
- Certain principles may not translate well or be relevant to software development and can be dropped or de-emphasized in the context of IT.

#### Modifying Existing Groups
- Adjust the scope or definition of some original principles based on their application to software, ensuring they are more directly applicable to the challenges faced in software design and development.

#### Splitting Groups
- Some principles might have broad applications in software development, warranting their division into more specialized groups. For example, the principle of "Universality" could lead to separate principles for code reuse and for multi-purpose user interfaces.

### Finalizing Inventive Principles for Information Technology
The outcome of this process is a set of revised or entirely new Inventive Principles tailored to information technology. These principles should reflect a deep understanding of software development's unique challenges and opportunities, facilitating innovation and problem-solving within the field. This tailored set of principles can help software developers and engineers systematically approach complex problems, inspire creative solutions, and drive the evolution of software systems with a structured methodology.

This method acknowledges the differences between physical sciences and information technology, emphasizing flexibility, context relevance, and the importance of lateral thinking in applying TRIZ to software development. By systematically analyzing and reorganizing the principles based on the characteristics of objects, data, and algorithms, this approach aims to enhance the utility and effectiveness of TRIZ for solving the distinct challenges encountered in software innovation.
