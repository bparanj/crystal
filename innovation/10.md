## Mapping Terminology

Mapping TRIZ terms to their equivalents in AI can bridge the gap between these two fields. Heress a comparison of some TRIZ terms and their AI counterparts:

| **TRIZ Term**          | **AI Equivalent**          |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Contradiction          | Problem/Challenge          |
| Contradiction Matrix   | Decision Matrix            |
| Inventive Principles   | Algorithms/Models          |
| Ideality               | Optimization               |
| Resources              | Data                       |
| System                 | Model/Architecture         |
| Levels of Abstraction  | Layers of Complexity       |
| Trends                 | Patterns/Trends            |
| Physical Effects       | Features/Attributes        |
| Substance-Field        | Input-Output               |
| Separation             | Modularization             |
| Segmentation           | Feature Extraction         |
| Local Quality          | Specificity                |
| Dynamization           | Automation                 |
| Preliminary Analysis   | Data Preprocessing         |
| Synthesis              | Integration                |
| Analysis               | Evaluation                 |

By mapping these terms, you can better understand how TRIZ methodologies can be applied within the context of AI development and problem-solving. This alignment can help streamline the innovation process and leverage the strengths of both approaches.
