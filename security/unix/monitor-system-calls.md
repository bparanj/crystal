Monitoring System Calls

Yes, you can configure the monitoring of system calls in a configuration file using tools like **auditd** or **Wazuh**. These tools allow you to set up rules that specify which system calls to monitor and log.

### Using auditd
With **auditd**, you can define rules in the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file. For example, to monitor all `open` system calls, you can add the following rule:

```bash
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S open -k open_monitor
```

This rule logs every `open` system call on a 64-bit architecture and tags the log entries with the key `open_monitor`.

### Using Wazuh
**Wazuh** also supports monitoring system calls through its configuration. You can add rules to the Wazuh configuration file to monitor specific system calls. For example, you can add a rule to monitor `execve` system calls:

```xml
<localfile>
    <log_format>audit</log_format>
    <location>/var/log/audit/audit.log</location>
</localfile>
```

Then, create an audit rule to monitor `execve`:

```bash
auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -k exec_monitor
```

This setup will log all `execve` system calls and tag them with the key `exec_monitor`.
