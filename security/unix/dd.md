Emulation refers to the process of imitating or replicating the functionality of one system using another system. This can be applied in various contexts:

1. **Computing**: In the realm of computers, emulation involves using software or hardware to mimic the behavior of another system. For example, a program that allows a computer to run software designed for a different operating system or hardware platform is an emulator⁴. This is commonly used for running old video games on modern systems or for testing software across different environments.

2. **General Usage**: Emulation can also mean striving to match or surpass someone else's achievements or qualities. This form of emulation is often driven by admiration and the desire to achieve similar success.
