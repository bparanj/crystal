## Data Duplicator

```bash
dd
```

The `dd` command in Linux stands for **"data duplicator"** or **"disk dump"**³⁵. It's a powerful utility used for low-level data copying and conversion, often employed to create exact copies of files, partitions, or entire disks. This makes it useful for tasks like creating backups, cloning drives, or writing disk images to physical media.
