Without a grub password, what clause can we add to the linux line during grub boot to force a root shell

To force a root shell during GRUB boot without a GRUB password, you can modify the `linux` line with the `init=/bin/bash` clause. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. At the GRUB menu, highlight the kernel you want to boot.
2. Press `e` to edit the boot entry.
3. Find the line starting with `linux` or `linuxefi`.
4. Append `init=/bin/bash` to the end of this line.
5. Press `Ctrl + X` or `F10` to boot with the modified entry.

This will boot the system into a root shell. Note that the filesystem will be mounted as read-only. To make changes, remount it as read-write using:

```bash
mount -o remount,rw /
```
