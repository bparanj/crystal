In Linux, the term "mount" refers to the process of making a filesystem accessible at a specific location in the directory tree. This operation links the filesystem from a storage device (like a hard drive, SSD, USB drive, or network share) to a directory (known as a mount point) in the main filesystem.

### Key Concepts of Mounting:

1. **Mount Point**:
   - A directory in the existing filesystem where the new filesystem will be attached. Common mount points include `/mnt` and `/media` for temporary storage, and custom directories for permanent storage.

2. **Filesystem**:
   - The structure and logic used to manage the storage and retrieval of data on a storage device. Examples include ext4, NTFS, FAT32, and others.

3. **Mount Command**:
   - The `mount` command is used to attach filesystems. The syntax generally follows:
     ```bash
     mount [OPTIONS] DEVICE MOUNT_POINT
     ```
   - Example: To mount a filesystem on `/dev/sdb1` to `/mnt/external`, you would use:
     ```bash
     sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/external
     ```

### Common Usage:

1. **Viewing Mounted Filesystems**:
   - To see all currently mounted filesystems, use:
     ```bash
     mount
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can use:
     ```bash
     df -h
     ```

2. **Unmounting a Filesystem**:
   - To detach a mounted filesystem, use the `umount` command:
     ```bash
     sudo umount MOUNT_POINT
     ```
   - Example: To unmount `/mnt/external`, you would use:
     ```bash
     sudo umount /mnt/external
     ```

3. **Automatic Mounting**:
   - Entries in the `/etc/fstab` file can be used to automatically mount filesystems at boot time. An example entry might look like this:
     ```
     /dev/sdb1  /mnt/external  ext4  defaults  0  2
     ```

### Options and Examples:

1. **Mount with Options**:
   - You can specify various options with the `mount` command to control the behavior of the mounted filesystem. Some common options include:
     - `-o ro`: Mount the filesystem as read-only.
     - `-o rw`: Mount the filesystem as read-write.
     - `-o noexec`: Do not allow execution of binaries on the mounted filesystem.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     sudo mount -o ro /dev/sdb1 /mnt/external
     ```

2. **Network Filesystems**:
   - Mounting network filesystems such as NFS (Network File System) or CIFS (Common Internet File System):
     - NFS example:
       ```bash
       sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.1.100:/exported/path /mnt/nfs
       ```
     - CIFS example:
       ```bash
       sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.1.100/shared /mnt/cifs -o username=user,password=pass
       ```

### Importance of Mounting:

- **Access to Data**: Mounting is essential for accessing data stored on different storage devices.
- **Filesystem Management**: Allows administrators to organize and manage filesystems efficiently.
- **Security and Permissions**: Mount options can be used to enhance security by controlling how filesystems are accessed and used.

By understanding how to use the `mount` command and manage mounted filesystems, you can effectively control how your Linux system accesses and interacts with different storage devices.

Yes, if mounting is not performed, the user cannot see or access the filesystem. Here’s why:

### How Mounting Works:
1. **Filesystem Accessibility**:
   - When a storage device (such as a hard drive, SSD, USB drive) is connected to a Linux system, the data on that device is organized in a filesystem. To make this filesystem accessible, it must be mounted to a directory (mount point) within the existing directory tree.
   - Without mounting, the operating system does not know where to integrate the filesystem into the directory structure, thus making it invisible and inaccessible to users and applications.

2. **Mount Points**:
   - A mount point is a directory where the filesystem is attached. Common mount points include `/mnt` or `/media` for removable storage, but it can be any directory you choose.
   - For example, if you connect an external hard drive but do not mount it, the system sees the hardware but does not integrate its data into the directory tree.

### Example Scenario:
- **Unmounted State**: If you plug in a USB drive but do not mount it, you won't see its files in any directory. Commands like `ls` will not list its contents because the filesystem is not accessible.
- **Mounted State**: Once you mount the USB drive to a directory (e.g., `/mnt/usb`), you can navigate to that directory and see, modify, or manage its files.

### Importance of Mounting:
1. **Data Access**: Mounting is essential for accessing the data stored on the device.
2. **System Integration**: It allows the filesystem to be integrated into the main filesystem hierarchy, making it possible to interact with the data as part of the broader directory structure.
3. **Security and Permissions**: Proper mounting ensures that the filesystem is accessible under defined security and permission settings, enhancing system security and data integrity.

### Consequences of Not Mounting:
- **Inaccessibility**: The primary consequence is that the filesystem remains inaccessible. Users cannot browse, read, or write data to the storage device.
- **System Management**: System tools and scripts that rely on accessing data from the device will fail because the necessary files and directories are not part of the directory tree.

### Verification:
- **Device Detection**: Tools like `lsblk`, `fdisk -l`, or `blkid` can list connected storage devices and partitions, showing that the hardware is recognized by the system.
- **Mounting Status**: The `mount` command or checking the `/etc/mtab` file can show which filesystems are currently mounted.

### Practical Example:
```bash
# List connected devices and their partitions
lsblk

# Mount the device /dev/sdb1 to /mnt/usb
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb

# Verify the filesystem is mounted
mount | grep /mnt/usb
```

By understanding and performing the mounting process, you ensure that filesystems on various storage devices are accessible and integrated into the system’s directory structure.

The physical device has to be mapped to a logical location in a directory structure during the mount. Is this correct?

Yes, you are correct. During the mount process in Linux (or any Unix-like operating system), a physical storage device is mapped to a logical location in the directory structure. This logical location is known as the mount point. Here’s a detailed explanation:

### Mounting Process:
1. **Physical Device**:
   - The physical storage device (e.g., hard drive, SSD, USB drive) is recognized by the operating system and represented as a device file in the `/dev` directory (e.g., `/dev/sda1` for the first partition on the first hard drive).

2. **Logical Location (Mount Point)**:
   - The mount point is an empty directory in the existing filesystem hierarchy where the device’s filesystem will be accessible. Common directories used as mount points include `/mnt` and `/media`, but any directory can be used.

### Steps Involved:
1. **Identify the Device**:
   - Use commands like `lsblk`, `fdisk -l`, or `blkid` to list available storage devices and their partitions.
     ```bash
     lsblk
     ```
2. **Create a Mount Point**:
   - Create a directory that will serve as the mount point if it does not already exist.
     ```bash
     sudo mkdir /mnt/mydrive
     ```
3. **Mount the Device**:
   - Use the `mount` command to map the device to the mount point.
     ```bash
     sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/mydrive
     ```
4. **Access the Filesystem**:
   - After mounting, the filesystem on the device can be accessed through the mount point directory.
     ```bash
     ls /mnt/mydrive
     ```

### Example:
If you have a USB drive connected as `/dev/sdb1` and you want to access its files, you would follow these steps:
1. **Create a Mount Point**:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/usbdrive
   ```
2. **Mount the Device**:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usbdrive
   ```
3. **Access the Files**:
   ```bash
   ls /mnt/usbdrive
   ```

### Unmounting:
When you no longer need to access the filesystem, you should unmount it to safely disconnect the device:
```bash
sudo umount /mnt/usbdrive
```

### Permanent Mounting (via `/etc/fstab`):
To automatically mount a filesystem at boot time, you can add an entry to the `/etc/fstab` file. This file contains information about disk drives and partitions to be mounted automatically:
```bash
/dev/sda1  /mnt/mydrive  ext4  defaults  0  2
```

By mapping a physical device to a logical location in the directory structure during the mount process, you make the device’s filesystem accessible to users and applications, integrating it seamlessly into the operating system’s file hierarchy.
