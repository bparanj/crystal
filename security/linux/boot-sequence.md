Linux boot process, from power-on to user login.

The sequence "BIOS/UEFI -> Boot loader -> Linux Kernel" outlines the core steps involved in booting a Linux system, but there are additional components and steps within this process that are important to understand. Here's a more detailed sequence:

1. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization**:
   - **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)** or **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)** initializes the hardware and performs a Power-On Self Test (POST) to ensure hardware components are functioning properly.
   - **Boot Device Selection**: BIOS/UEFI selects the boot device (e.g., HDD, SSD, USB) based on the configured boot order.

2. **MBR/GPT**:
   - **Master Boot Record (MBR)** or **GUID Partition Table (GPT)**: The boot process reads the partition table to locate the boot loader. MBR is used in older systems, while GPT is used in modern systems with UEFI.

3. **Boot Loader**:
   - The boot loader (such as GRUB, LILO, or Syslinux) is loaded from the boot sector (MBR/GPT).
   - The boot loader loads the initial RAM disk (`initrd` or `initramfs`) into memory. This disk contains temporary root file system and essential drivers needed to access the  root filesystem.
   - The boot loader then loads the Linux kernel into memory and passes control to it.

4. **Linux Kernel Initialization**:
   - The kernel initializes hardware components and mounts the `initrd` or `initramfs` as a temporary root filesystem.
   - The kernel executes the `init` process (or `systemd` in modern Linux distributions).

5. **`init` or `systemd` Initialization**:
   - **`init` or `systemd`**: The first process started by the Linux kernel, responsible for initializing user space and setting up the system environment.
   - **Service Initialization**: System services and background processes (daemons) are started according to the system configuration.

6. **Login Manager (optional)**:
   - **Display Manager**: If a graphical environment is used, a display manager (such as GDM, LightDM, or SDDM) is started, providing a graphical login interface.
   - **Console Login**: For systems without a graphical environment, a console login prompt is displayed.

### Complete Boot Sequence:

1. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization**
2. **MBR/GPT Boot Loader Location**
3. **Boot Loader Execution (GRUB, LILO, etc.)**
4. **Loading Initial RAM Disk (initrd/initramfs)**
5. **Linux Kernel Initialization**
6. **Execution of `init` or `systemd`**
7. **Service Initialization and Daemons Startup**
8. **Display Manager/Console Login Prompt**
