SIGTRAP signal

The `SIGTRAP` signal, short for "Signal Trap," is used primarily for debugging purposes in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It is sent to a process when an exception or trap occurs, such as when a debugger has requested to be informed of specific conditions¹².

- **Debugging**: It is commonly used by debuggers like `gdb` to set breakpoints or watchpoints. When the program execution reaches a breakpoint, the `SIGTRAP` signal is sent to the process, allowing the debugger to take control and inspect the program's state¹³.
- **Exception Handling**: It can also be triggered by certain exceptions or conditions that the programmer wants to investigate further².
- **Process Control**: When a process receives a `SIGTRAP` signal, it typically stops execution, allowing the debugger to analyze the situation.
