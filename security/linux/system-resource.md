### What are System Resources in Linux?

System resources in Linux refer to the various components and assets of the computer system that are managed and utilized by the operating system to perform tasks and run applications. These resources include both hardware and software elements that are essential for the functioning of the system.

### Types of System Resources:

1. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**:
   - **Function**: Executes instructions from programs and processes.
   - **Resource Management**: The kernel schedules processes and allocates CPU time to ensure efficient execution of tasks.

2. **Memory (RAM)**:
   - **Function**: Temporary storage for data and instructions that the CPU needs while executing tasks.
   - **Resource Management**: The kernel manages memory allocation and deallocation, ensuring that processes have the memory they need while maintaining overall system stability.

3. **Storage Devices**:
   - **Function**: Long-term storage of data and programs, including hard drives, SSDs, and other storage media.
   - **Resource Management**: The kernel manages file systems and storage space, including reading from and writing to disks.

4. **Input/Output (I/O) Devices**:
   - **Function**: Devices such as keyboards, mice, printers, and network interfaces that allow interaction with the system.
   - **Resource Management**: The kernel handles I/O operations, including device drivers and managing data transfer between devices and the system.

5. **Network Resources**:
   - **Function**: Network interfaces and protocols that enable communication with other systems.
   - **Resource Management**: The kernel manages network connections, data transfer, and protocol handling.

6. **Processes**:
   - **Function**: Running instances of programs that perform tasks.
   - **Resource Management**: The kernel schedules and manages processes, including multitasking and inter-process communication (IPC).

7. **System Services**:
   - **Function**: Background services and daemons that perform various system functions.
   - **Resource Management**: The kernel and system utilities manage the startup, execution, and shutdown of these services.

### Why is it Named "System Resources"?

The term "system resources" is used because these components and assets are essential resources required for the system to function effectively. Just as resources in the natural world are necessary for various activities and processes, system resources are necessary for the computing system to perform tasks and run applications. The management and allocation of these resources are critical to maintaining system performance, stability, and efficiency.

### Examples of Resource Management:

1. **CPU Scheduling**:
   - The kernel uses scheduling algorithms to allocate CPU time to processes, balancing load and ensuring responsiveness.

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Techniques such as paging and swapping are used to manage memory allocation, ensuring that all running processes have the necessary memory.

3. **File System Management**:
   - The kernel manages file systems, handling data storage and retrieval, file permissions, and space allocation.

4. **Device Management**:
   - The kernel interacts with device drivers to manage hardware devices, handling I/O operations and ensuring proper device functioning.
