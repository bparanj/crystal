An instance of a program that is running is called a "process" because of how the term captures the dynamic nature of executing software. Here are the key reasons and historical context:

### Key Reasons:
1. **Dynamic Activity**:
   - **Definition**: The term "process" implies an ongoing activity or series of operations. When a program is running, it involves active computation, management of resources, and interaction with the operating system, which fits the dynamic nature suggested by the term "process."
   - **Dynamic Execution**: Unlike static code (which is just a set of instructions), a process is the active execution of those instructions, involving changing states, scheduling, and resource management.

2. **Resource Management**:
   - **Isolation**: Each process has its own allocated resources such as memory, file handles, and CPU time, which the operating system manages. This isolation and management are key aspects of what a process represents.
   - **Lifecycle**: A process goes through a lifecycle, from creation to termination, involving various states (like running, waiting, and sleeping). This lifecycle is a core part of what differentiates a process from a mere program.

3. **Historical Context**:
   - **Early Computing**: In the early days of computing, the term was used to describe the execution of jobs in batch processing systems. Over time, as interactive computing became more prevalent, the term "process" continued to be used to describe active job execution.
   - **Operating System Design**: The design and terminology of modern operating systems (such as Unix) have cemented the term "process" as a fundamental concept in computer science. The process model became a standard way to describe executing programs because it clearly differentiates between the static program code and the dynamic, resource-managing execution entity.

By using the term "process," we capture the essence of a running program as a dynamic entity that interacts with the system and manages resources, highlighting the contrast with static, non-executing program code.
