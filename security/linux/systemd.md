### What is systemd in Linux?

**systemd** is an init system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is responsible for initializing the system during boot, managing system services, and handling various other tasks related to system management. systemd is a replacement for older init systems like System V init and Upstart.

### Key Functions of systemd:

1. **System Initialization**:
   - systemd is responsible for bootstrapping the user space and initializing system components after the kernel has booted.
   
2. **Service Management**:
   - It manages and supervises system services. Services can be started, stopped, restarted, and reloaded using systemd commands.

3. **Parallelization**:
   - systemd supports concurrent service startup, significantly speeding up the boot process by running multiple services in parallel.

4. **Dependency Management**:
   - It manages service dependencies, ensuring that services are started in the correct order based on their dependencies.

5. **On-Demand Service Starting**:
   - Services can be started on-demand when needed, rather than running continuously.

6. **Logging**:
   - systemd integrates with the journal service (journald) to provide centralized logging for system and application logs.

7. **Device and Mount Point Management**:
   - It manages device and mount point states, ensuring that filesystems are mounted and unmounted correctly.

8. **Resource Control**:
   - systemd uses cgroups (control groups) to limit, account for, and isolate resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O) of processes.

### Why is it Named systemd?

The name **systemd** comes from the combination of "system" and "d," which stands for "daemon." In Unix-like operating systems, a daemon is a background process that handles system-level tasks. The "d" in systemd signifies that it is a daemon responsible for managing the entire system. The name reflects its role as a critical component that handles system initialization and service management, running continuously in the background.

### Basic systemd Commands:

- **Starting a Service**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start service_name
  ```

- **Stopping a Service**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop service_name
  ```

- **Restarting a Service**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart service_name
  ```

- **Enabling a Service to Start at Boot**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable service_name
  ```

- **Disabling a Service from Starting at Boot**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl disable service_name
  ```

- **Checking the Status of a Service**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status service_name
  ```

systemd is a powerful and complex init system and service manager that has become the standard in many Linux distributions due to its advanced features and capabilities. Its name reflects its core function as a daemon that manages the entire system.
