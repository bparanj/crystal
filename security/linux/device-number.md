Device Number

In Debian Linux, a device number is used to uniquely identify devices within the system. Each device is assigned a **major number** and a **minor number**:

1. **Major Number**: This identifies the driver associated with the device. For example, all hard drives might have the same major number because they use the same driver.
2. **Minor Number**: This differentiates between devices that use the same driver. For instance, different partitions on the same hard drive will have different minor numbers.

You can view device numbers using the `ls -l /dev` command, which lists all devices in the `/dev` directory along with their major and minor numbers. Here's an example output:

```bash
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 0 Sep 13 12:00 sda
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 1 Sep 13 12:00 sda1
```

In this example:
- `sda` has a major number of 8 and a minor number of 0.
- `sda1` (a partition on `sda`) has a major number of 8 and a minor number of 1.
