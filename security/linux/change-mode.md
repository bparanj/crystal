The term **`chmod`** in Linux stands for **"change mode"**. This command is used to change the file system modes of files and directories. Specifically, `chmod` changes the permissions associated with files and directories, controlling the ability of users to read, write, or execute these items.

### Explanation of `chmod`:

1. **Permissions**:
   - **Read (r)**: Permission to read the file or list the directory.
   - **Write (w)**: Permission to modify the file or write to the directory.
   - **Execute (x)**: Permission to execute the file or access the directory.

2. **Syntax**:
   - The basic syntax of the `chmod` command is:
     ```bash
     chmod [options] mode file
     ```
   - **Mode** can be specified either in symbolic form (e.g., `u+r`, `g-w`, `o+x`) or numeric form (e.g., `755`, `644`).

3. **Usage Examples**:
   - **Symbolic Mode**:
     ```bash
     chmod u+r filename    # Adds read permission for the owner
     chmod g-w filename    # Removes write permission for the group
     chmod o+x filename    # Adds execute permission for others
     ```
   - **Numeric Mode**:
     ```bash
     chmod 755 filename    # Sets read, write, and execute permissions for owner, and read and execute permissions for group and others
     chmod 644 filename    # Sets read and write permissions for owner, and read permissions for group and others
     ```

The `chmod` command is used to manage file permissions and ensure proper access control in a Linux system, which is important for system security and functionality.
