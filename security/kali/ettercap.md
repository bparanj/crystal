**Ettercap** is a comprehensive network security tool that is primarily used for **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks** on local area networks. It allows users to intercept, analyze, and manipulate network traffic. 

### Key Features of Ettercap:
1. **MITM Attacks**: Ettercap can perform MITM attacks, allowing the attacker to intercept and modify data being transferred between devices on the same network.
2. **Packet Sniffing**: It captures and analyzes network packets, useful for identifying vulnerabilities or gathering information.
3. **Protocol Dissection**: Ettercap supports many protocols, including TCP, UDP, HTTP, and HTTPS, allowing for deep analysis of different types of traffic.
4. **Network Poisoning**: It can poison ARP tables or DNS caches, redirecting traffic to the attacker’s machine.
5. **Active and Passive Modes**: It can operate in both modes, actively modifying traffic or simply observing without altering anything.

Ettercap is often used by security professionals for **network testing and auditing**, but it can also be misused for malicious purposes, such as credential theft or traffic manipulation.

It is available on many platforms and comes pre-installed in security-focused Linux distributions like **Kali Linux**【79†source】【82†source】.

To capture packets from other systems during a **spoofing attack**, the tool you would typically use is **Ettercap**. Ettercap supports **ARP poisoning (spoofing)**, which allows you to intercept and capture traffic between other devices on the same network.

### How it works:
1. **ARP Spoofing**: Ettercap can poison the ARP cache of systems on the network, making them believe that your system is the gateway. This allows you to intercept their traffic.
2. **Packet Sniffing**: Once the traffic is being routed through your machine, Ettercap can capture, analyze, and log the packets for further inspection.
   
Other tools that are commonly used in combination with ARP spoofing for packet capturing:
- **Wireshark**: Once you've used Ettercap or another tool for ARP spoofing, you can use Wireshark to capture and analyze the traffic.
- **Cain & Abel**: Another tool that can perform ARP poisoning and capture traffic, often used in Windows environments.
- **Bettercap**: A modern alternative to Ettercap that also supports ARP spoofing and packet capture.

These tools allow you to manipulate network traffic and intercept packets that would not normally be directed to your system. However, use of these tools for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical.
