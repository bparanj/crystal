Both **watchdog** and **system monitor** are terms related to ensuring the stability and availability of processes, but they have slightly different focuses:

- **Watchdog**: Refers specifically to a mechanism or application that monitors a process or system for failures and takes action (such as restarting the process) if something goes wrong. Watchdogs are typically used for automatic recovery and high availability of critical services.
  
  Example: A hardware or software watchdog timer that resets a system if it becomes unresponsive.

- **System Monitor**: Is a broader term that refers to applications that monitor system performance, processes, and resources (like CPU, memory, disk usage), and may alert or log information but don't necessarily take corrective actions like restarting a process.

  Example: **htop** or **Glances**, which monitor overall system health without intervening directly.

For ensuring a process stays running, the term **watchdog** is more accurate.

An application that watches a process to ensure it stays running is called a **process supervisor** or **process monitor**. 

Examples of such applications include:
- **Systemd** (Linux): Manages and monitors system processes and services.
- **supervisord**: A lightweight process control system.
- **Monit**: A monitoring tool that can restart services if they fail.

These tools automatically restart the process if it crashes or stops unexpectedly, ensuring high availability.
