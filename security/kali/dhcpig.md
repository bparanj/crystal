Yes, **dhcpig** is a tool used to perform advanced **DHCP exhaustion attacks**. It works by flooding a network's DHCP server with numerous DHCP requests, eventually exhausting all available IP addresses on the network. This prevents new devices from obtaining an IP address and can potentially cause a denial of service (DoS). 

Key functions of **dhcpig** include:
- **Exhausting IP addresses**: It repeatedly requests all available IPs on the network, consuming the DHCP pool.
- **Sending gratuitous ARP**: It can knock off Windows systems on the network by sending unsolicited ARP messages.
- **Releasing neighbor IPs**: It can scan the network and send DHCP release messages to disconnect other devices.

This tool is often used in stress testing or security audits.
