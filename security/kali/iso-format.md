An **.iso file** is a type of disk image file that contains an exact copy of the data found on an optical disc, such as a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray. This file format is often used to distribute software, operating systems, or other large sets of files because it preserves the exact structure and content of the original disc.

### What Does ISO Stand For?

**ISO** stands for **International Organization for Standardization**. The file format was named after this organization because the `.iso` format adheres to the ISO 9660 standard, which defines a file system for CD-ROMs. The name reflects the format's adherence to this international standard for disk image files.

### Key Characteristics of an .iso File:

- **Complete Disk Image**: It includes all the data on the original disc, including the file system information, bootable sections, and any other content that was present.
  
- **Usage**: `.iso` files are commonly used for distributing operating systems, software packages, and media content. They can be burned to physical discs or mounted as virtual drives on a computer.

- **Bootable Media**: Many `.iso` files, especially those containing operating systems, are designed to be bootable, meaning you can boot your computer directly from the .iso file when it's burned to a CD/DVD or written to a USB drive.

### How to Use an .iso File:

- **Burn to a Disc**: You can write the `.iso` file to a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disc using disc burning software.
  
- **Mount as a Virtual Drive**: On most modern operating systems, you can mount the `.iso` file as if it were a physical drive, allowing you to access its contents without burning it to a disc.

- **Create Bootable USB**: You can use tools like `Rufus` (Windows) or `dd` (Linux/Mac) to create a bootable USB drive from an `.iso` file, which is often used for installing operating systems.

### Summary:
An **.iso file** is a disk image file that stands for **International Organization for Standardization**, reflecting its adherence to the ISO 9660 standard. It contains an exact replica of the contents of a physical disc and is commonly used for software distribution and creating bootable media.
