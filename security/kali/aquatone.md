- name: Install aquatone
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: assessment_tool
  vars:
    assessment_tool_archive_src: "https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone/releases/download/v1.7.0/aquatone_linux_amd64_1.7.0.zip"
    assessment_tool_install_dir: /tools/aquatone
```

**Explanation**:
- **name: Install aquatone**: This task's description indicates that its purpose is to install the Aquatone tool.
- **ansible.builtin.include_role**: This module includes a role, which is a collection of Ansible tasks, variables, and handlers that can be reused and shared.
  - **name: assessment_tool**: This specifies the name of the role to include. The `assessment_tool` role presumably contains the logic to download, extract, and install tools from an archive.
- **vars**: This section defines variables that are passed to the included role.
  - **assessment_tool_archive_src**: This variable specifies the source URL of the Aquatone archive to be downloaded.
    - `"https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone/releases/download/v1.7.0/aquatone_linux_amd64_1.7.0.zip"`: The URL points to the Aquatone release archive on GitHub.
  - **assessment_tool_install_dir**: This variable defines the directory where Aquatone should be installed.
    - `/tools/aquatone`: The specified directory for installation.

**Summary**:
- The first task installs Chromium, a dependency required for Aquatone to function.
- The second task includes a role to handle the installation of Aquatone by downloading it from a specified URL and installing it into a specified directory.

This playbook sets up the necessary environment and installs Aquatone on the target machine, ensuring it is ready for use.

This Ansible playbook consists of two tasks that work together to install the Aquatone tool and its dependencies on a target system. Let's break it down:

1. First task: Install dependencies for Aquatone
   - The first task is named "Install dependencies for aquatone".
   - It uses the `ansible.builtin.package` module to install the required dependencies.
   - In this case, the only dependency specified is "chromium".
   - The `name` parameter is used to specify the package name.

2. Second task: Install Aquatone
   - The second task is named "Install aquatone".
   - It uses the `ansible.builtin.include_role` module to include and execute a separate Ansible role named "assessment_tool".
   - The `name` parameter specifies the name of the role to be included.
   - The `vars` parameter is used to pass variables to the included role.
   - Two variables are passed to the role:
     - `assessment_tool_archive_src`: This variable specifies the URL of the Aquatone release archive that needs to be downloaded. In this case, it points to the ZIP file of Aquatone version 1.7.0 for Linux AMD64 architecture, hosted on the GitHub releases page.
     - `assessment_tool_install_dir`: This variable specifies the directory where Aquatone will be installed on the target system. In this case, it is set to "/tools/aquatone".

The "assessment_tool" role mentioned in the playbook is likely a custom role created to handle the installation of various assessment tools. This role would  handle tasks such as downloading the specified archive, extracting its contents, and setting up the tool in the specified installation directory.

By  the "assessment_tool" role with the provided variables, the playbook ensures that Aquatone is downloaded from the specified URL and installed in the designated directory on the target system.

Overall, this playbook automates the process of installing Aquatone and its dependencies (in this case, chromium) on the target system, making it easier to set up the tool for security assessments or other purposes.

Aquatone is an open-source tool used for visual inspection and reconnaissance of websites across a large number of hosts. It is designed to aid in the discovery and analysis of websites, particularly during the reconnaissance phase of a security assessment or penetration testing engagement.

Key features and uses of Aquatone:

1. Visual Inspection: Aquatone captures screenshots of websites across multiple hosts, providing a visual overview of the target organization's web presence. This allows security professionals to quickly identify and analyze the websites' content, design, and potential vulnerabilities.

2. Subdomain Discovery: Aquatone integrates with subdomain discovery tools like Sublist3r or Amass to identify subdomains associated with the target organization. It then captures screenshots of each discovered subdomain, enabling a comprehensive visual analysis of the organization's attack surface.

3. Responsive Design Detection: Aquatone can identify responsive websites by capturing screenshots at different screen resolutions. This helps in understanding the website's behavior and potential attack vectors across various devices.

4. Asset Categorization: Aquatone provides a report that categorizes discovered websites based on their content, such as login forms, error pages, or default web server pages. This categorization aids in prioritizing and focusing on the most critical or vulnerable assets.

5. Batch Processing: Aquatone can process a large number of hosts concurrently, making it efficient for assessing organizations with a significant web presence.

When to use Aquatone:

1. Reconnaissance Phase: Aquatone is primarily used during the reconnaissance phase of a security assessment or penetration testing engagement. It helps in gathering visual information about the target organization's websites and subdomains, providing valuable insights for further analysis and attack planning.

2. Large-scale Assessments: Aquatone is useful when assessing organizations with a large number of websites or subdomains. Its batch processing capabilities make it efficient for capturing screenshots and generating reports across multiple hosts simultaneously.

3. Asset Inventory: Aquatone can be used to create a visual inventory of an organization's web assets. This inventory can be used for various purposes, such as tracking changes over time, identifying forgotten or abandoned websites, or assessing the organization's overall web presence.
