To search for a directory called **`kali`** starting from the current directory, you can use the following `find` command:

```bash
find . -type d -name "kali"
```

### Explanation:
- **`find`**: The command used to search for files and directories.
- **`.`**: Represents the current directory from which the search will start.
- **`-type d`**: Specifies that you are looking for directories (`d` stands for directory).
- **`-name "kali"`**: Searches for directories with the exact name "kali".

This will search for the directory named **`kali`** within the current directory and all its subdirectories.
