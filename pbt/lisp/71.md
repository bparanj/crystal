To invoke the SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) prompt on your Mac, you need to have SBCL installed. Assuming you've installed it (for instance, using Homebrew as previously described), you can easily start SBCL and enter its interactive prompt (REPL - Read Eval Print Loop) by following these steps:

1. **Open Terminal**: Open the Terminal application on your Mac. You can find it using Spotlight (Cmd + Space) and typing "Terminal", or it can be found in the Utilities folder within Applications.

2. **Start SBCL**: In the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:

   ```bash
   sbcl
   ```

3. **Using SBCL**: After entering the command, the SBCL prompt should appear, indicated by a `*` symbol. From here, you can start typing and executing Lisp expressions.

   ```
   * (print "Hello, World!")
   ```

   This will print "Hello, World!" to the console, along with the returned value of the `print` function.

4. **Exiting SBCL**: To exit the SBCL prompt and return to the regular terminal prompt, you can use the `(quit)` command:

   ```
   * (quit)
   ```

You are now in the SBCL environment and can start experimenting with Lisp programming. SBCL provides a rich set of features for Lisp development, including an interactive environment for testing and debugging your Lisp code.
