In traditional Lisp dialects like Common Lisp and Scheme, the type system is dynamically typed rather than statically typed, meaning that types are associated with values at runtime rather than with variables at compile time. Due to this dynamic typing, traditional Lisp systems do not perform type inference in the same way that statically typed languages with type inference capabilities (like Haskell or Scala) do.

However, some Lisp implementations and modern Lisp dialects may offer features or tools that can analyze code and provide type information or warnings about potential type errors. For example:

- **Typed Racket**: An extension of Racket (a Scheme dialect) that adds optional static typing and type inference, allowing programmers to annotate their code with type information which is then checked at compile time.

- **SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp)**: While SBCL is dynamically typed, it can perform some degree of type inference during compilation, issuing warnings about type mismatches or potential runtime type errors based on the code's structure and the explicit type declarations provided by the programmer.

- **Clojure**: Being a dynamically typed language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Clojure doesn't have traditional type inference. However, it has optional type hints that can be used to improve performance or interoperate more efficiently with Java types.

In summary, while traditional Lisp dialects do not rely on type inference as part of their core language design, certain implementations and extensions may use type inference-like features to enhance error checking, performance, or interoperability with statically typed systems.
