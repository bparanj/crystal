Lisp is closely related to lambda calculus. Lambda calculus, developed by Alonzo Church in the 1930s, is a formal system in mathematical logic and computer science for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. It is considered one of the foundational models of computation and has deeply influenced the design of many programming languages, including Lisp.

Lisp was created by John McCarthy in 1958 with the goal of providing a practical computational model for programming. McCarthy recognized the power of lambda calculus as a model for computation and incorporated its concepts into Lisp, making functions first-class citizens and allowing for function definition, function application, and recursion. The lambda expression in Lisp, which defines anonymous functions, directly reflects the lambda abstraction mechanism of lambda calculus.

While Lisp has evolved significantly since its inception, incorporating many features beyond what is found in pure lambda calculus, the influence of lambda calculus is evident in Lisp's treatment of functions, its use of symbolic expressions, and its emphasis on recursion. This foundational relationship with lambda calculus contributes to Lisp's expressive power and its historical importance in the development of functional programming paradigms.
