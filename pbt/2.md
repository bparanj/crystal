For property-based testing in Ruby, you can use the `rantly` gem. Here's how you can translate your Elixir code to Ruby using `rantly`:

1. Add the `rantly` gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rantly'
```

2. Run `bundle install` to install the gem.

3. Here's how your Elixir code would look translated to Ruby:

```ruby
require 'rantly'
require 'rantly/rspec_extensions'
require 'rantly/shrinks'

describe 'PbtTest' do
  it 'finds biggest element' do
    property_of {
      Rantly { sized(100) { array(range(-100, 100)) } }
    }.check { |array|
      expect(biggest(array)).to eq array.max
    }
  end

  def biggest(array)
    array.reduce do |max, item|
      item > max ? item : max
    end
  end
end
```

In this Ruby code, we're using the `rantly` gem to generate random arrays of integers, similar to the `non_empty(list(integer()))` generator in your Elixir code. The `biggest` method is equivalent to the `biggest` function in your Elixir code.
