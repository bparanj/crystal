## Create a New Project

Creating a new Haskell project to use QuickCheck typically involves setting up a project structure with Stack or Cabal. Here's how you can do it using both tools:

### Using Stack

1. **Install Stack** (if not already installed):
   - You can install Stack on macOS using Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install haskell-stack
     ```

2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     stack new my-quickcheck-project
     ```
   - Replace `my-quickcheck-project` with your desired project name.
   - This command creates a new directory with the basic structure of a Haskell project.

3. **Add QuickCheck as a Dependency**:
   - Navigate to your project directory:
     ```bash
     cd my-quickcheck-project
     ```
   - Open the `package.yaml` file and add `QuickCheck` to the `dependencies` section under `library` or `executables` as appropriate.

4. **Build the Project**:
   - Inside your project directory, run:
     ```bash
     stack build
     ```
   - This will download and install the necessary dependencies, including QuickCheck.

### Using Cabal

1. **Install Cabal and GHC** (if not already installed):
   - You can install GHC and Cabal using GHCup, as previously described.

2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     cabal init
     ```
   - This will guide you through creating a new project. It will ask several questions to set up your project.

3. **Add QuickCheck as a Dependency**:
   - Open the generated `.cabal` file in your project directory.
   - In the `build-depends` section of your executable or library, add `QuickCheck`. For example:
     ```haskell
     build-depends:       base >=4.7 && <5, QuickCheck >=2.14
     ```

4. **Build the Project**:
   - Inside your project directory, run:
     ```bash
     cabal build
     ```
   - This will compile your project and download necessary dependencies.

### Writing a QuickCheck Test

After setting up the project, you can write QuickCheck tests. For example, add a new Haskell file for your tests, e.g., `test/Spec.hs`, and write a simple property test:

```haskell
import Test.QuickCheck

prop_reverse :: [Int] -> Bool
prop_reverse xs = reverse (reverse xs) == xs

main :: IO ()
main = quickCheck prop_reverse
```

To run this test, use `stack test` in a Stack project or `cabal test` in a Cabal project.

The specific steps might slightly vary based on the versions of the tools and the configuration of your system. This is a basic guideline to get you started with a new Haskell project using QuickCheck.

## Cabal Init

What is the choice for writing a pbt test when cabal init is run?

When you run `cabal init` to initialize a new Haskell project, the command-line tool will guide you through a series of questions to set up your project. One of these questions pertains to the type of project you're creating, and this choice affects how your project directory and initial files are structured.

For writing property-based tests (PBT) using QuickCheck, you typically want to set up a library and/or an executable along with a test suite. Here's a general guide on what to choose:

1. **Project Type**: When asked about the project type, you can choose either:
   - **Executable**: If you're planning to write a standalone application.
   - **Library**: If you're creating a library that other programs can use.
   - **Library and Executable**: If you need both.

2. **Source Directory**: You can go with the default (`src`) for your source files.

3. **Test Suite**: When asked whether you'd like to add a test suite, select **Yes**. This will create a test directory (`tests`) where you can write your property-based tests using QuickCheck.

4. **Base Language**: Usually, Haskell is the language.

5. **Other Choices**: The rest of the choices (such as project name, version, description, author details, and license) are up to your personal or project requirements.

Once the setup is complete, `cabal init` will generate the necessary files and directory structure. You'll find a `.cabal` file where you can add `QuickCheck` to the `build-depends` section under the test-suite configuration. It might look something like this:

```haskell
test-suite my-test-suite
  type: exitcode-stdio-1.0
  hs-source-dirs: test
  main-is: Main.hs
  build-depends: base, QuickCheck
  default-language: Haskell2010
```

In the `test` directory, you can create a Haskell file (like `Main.hs`) to write your QuickCheck tests. An example test might look like:

```haskell
import Test.QuickCheck

prop_ReverseList :: [Int] -> Bool
prop_ReverseList xs = reverse (reverse xs) == xs

main :: IO ()
main = quickCheck prop_ReverseList
```

Run your tests with `cabal test`. This setup helps keep your tests organized and makes it easy to integrate property-based testing into your Haskell development workflow.

## Choosing the Language Version

When prompted to choose a language for your executable during the `cabal init` process, you're essentially selecting the language standard for your Haskell project. Here's a brief overview of the options:

1. **Haskell2010**: This is the most commonly used standard and is recommended for general use. It's widely supported and includes most of the features that Haskell programmers expect.

2. **Haskell98**: This is an older standard. You might choose this if you specifically need compatibility with older Haskell code, but for most new projects, Haskell2010 or GHC2021 is preferable.

3. **GHC2021**: This is a newer language standard introduced with GHC 9.2 and includes several extensions to the language that are commonly used in Haskell development. If you are using GHC 9.2 or later and want to take advantage of these newer features by default, you can choose this option.

4. **Other**: This allows you to specify a custom set of language extensions or a different standard, but it's mostly used for specific, advanced cases.

For most new projects, **Haskell2010** is a solid default choice. It's modern enough for most purposes while being widely supported and stable. If you're using a newer version of GHC and want to leverage the latest language features without manually enabling specific extensions, **GHC2021** is a good choice.

If you're just starting out or don't have specific requirements that necessitate a different standard, I recommend going with **Haskell2010**.

For : ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 9.4.8
which one should I pick?

Given that you're using GHC version 9.4.8, which is a recent and modern version of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, you have the flexibility to choose either **Haskell2010** or **GHC2021** for your language standard when running `cabal init`. 

Here's a bit more detail to help you decide:

- **Haskell2010**: This is a safe and standard choice, widely compatible and suitable for most projects. It's the de facto standard for Haskell and supports the features most Haskell developers expect. If you're unsure or don't require specific features from GHC2021, this is a solid choice.

- **GHC2021**: This option includes a set of language extensions that are commonly used in modern Haskell development. It's designed to be a more "batteries included" experience for Haskell developers, reducing the need to manually enable certain popular extensions. If you want to take advantage of newer language features and don't mind using a standard that is specific to GHC, then GHC2021 is a good option.

Given your GHC version (9.4.8), which supports GHC2021, your choice largely depends on your project's needs and your comfort level with Haskell:

- If you're relatively new to Haskell or working on a project that doesn't require the latest features, **Haskell2010** is a great choice.
- If you're comfortable with Haskell and want to leverage the newer features and extensions without manually enabling them, go for **GHC2021**. 

Both options are perfectly valid, and you can still enable or disable specific language extensions in your project's `.cabal` file, regardless of the base standard you choose.

## Build Dependency

To add QuickCheck to a Haskell project created using the `cabal init` command, you'll need to modify the `.cabal` file in your project directory. Here's how to do it:

1. **Locate the `.cabal` File**:
   - Open the project directory.
   - Find the `.cabal` file. It will be named after your project (e.g., `myproject.cabal`).

2. **Edit the `.cabal` File**:
   - Open the `.cabal` file in a text editor.
   - Look for the `build-depends` section under the `executable`, `library`, or `test-suite` sections, depending on where you want to use QuickCheck.

3. **Add QuickCheck to the Dependencies**:
   - In the `build-depends` section, add `QuickCheck`. You can also specify a version range. For example:
     ```haskell
     build-depends:       base >= 4.7 && < 5
                        , QuickCheck >= 2.14 && < 2.15
     ```
   - This line means your project depends on the `base` library (a standard Haskell library) and `QuickCheck` for property-based testing. The version range ensures compatibility.

4. **Save the `.cabal` File**:
   - Save your changes and close the text editor.

5. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Open a terminal in your project directory.
   - Run the following command to install the project dependencies, including QuickCheck:
     ```bash
     cabal update  # Optional, but recommended to update the package list
     cabal build
     ```

6. **Writing QuickCheck Tests**:
   - After adding QuickCheck as a dependency, you can write tests using it.
   - Create a new Haskell file for your tests in the `tests` directory (you might need to create this directory if it doesn't exist).
   - Write your QuickCheck tests in this file. Here's a simple example:
     ```haskell
     import Test.QuickCheck

     prop_reverse :: [Int] -> Bool
     prop_reverse xs = reverse (reverse xs) == xs

     main :: IO ()
     main = quickCheck prop_reverse
     ```

7. **Run Your Tests**:
   - Use Cabal to run your tests. If you have set up a test suite in your `.cabal` file, you can run it with:
     ```bash
     cabal test
     ```

This process adds QuickCheck to your Haskell project and allows you to use it for writing and running property-based tests. Remember to follow Haskell syntax and best practices when modifying the `.cabal` file and writing your tests.

## Bonjour

prints:

Hello, Haskell!

## Fixing Warnings

Since you already have GSL (GNU Scientific Library) version 2.7.1 installed and up-to-date, the warning about the missing search path `/usr/local/Cellar/gsl/1.16/lib/` likely indicates a mismatch between where the linker is looking for GSL and where it is actually installed. This can happen due to several reasons:

1. **Version Mismatch**: The linker is looking for GSL version 1.16, but you have version 2.7.1 installed. It's possible that your project configuration specifies an older version.

2. **Incorrect Library Path**: The specified path in the build configuration might be incorrect or outdated.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue:

1. **Check Installed GSL Path**:
   - Verify the installation path of GSL 2.7.1. You can do this by running:
     ```bash
     gsl-config --prefix
     ```
   - This command should give you the correct installation path for GSL.

2. **Update Build Configuration**:
   - Update your project's build configuration (likely in your `.cabal` file or a custom build script) to refer to the correct path of GSL 2.7.1.
   - Make sure any reference to GSL points to the correct version and path.

3. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Sometimes, setting the `LIBRARY_PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables can help the linker find the libraries. You can set them to the GSL lib directory:
     ```bash
     export LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/gsl-2.7.1/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/gsl-2.7.1/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ```
   - Replace `/path/to/gsl-2.7.1/lib` with the actual path you found from `gsl-config --prefix`.

4. **Rebuild the Project**:
   - After making these changes, rebuild your project with `cabal build`.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Dependency Specification**: Ensure that any Haskell bindings or interfaces to GSL (if you're using them) are compatible with GSL version 2.7.1.
- **Cabal File**: If your `.cabal` file directly references GSL paths or versions, update them accordingly.

If the issue persists after these steps, you might need to further investigate the specific way GSL is being used or linked in your project, including any native bindings or specific build settings related to GSL.

```
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gsl/2.7.1/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gsl/2.7.1/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
