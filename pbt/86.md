Lisp, like most programming languages, is designed to run on computers adhering to the von Neumann architecture, which is the predominant computer architecture model used since the mid-20th century. The von Neumann architecture describes a system where the computer consists of a Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and I/O devices, with both program instructions and data stored in memory. This architecture influences how programming languages, including Lisp, are executed on computers.

However, Lisp's design, especially its emphasis on recursion, symbolic processing, and list manipulation, is not inherently dependent on von Neumann architecture in any conceptual sense. Lisp's features and capabilities are more about the language's expressive power and less about the underlying hardware architecture. In theory, Lisp could be adapted to run on non-von Neumann architectures, such as dataflow architectures or parallel computing systems, provided there is an appropriate interpreter or compiler for that architecture.

The key point here is that while Lisp (and other programming languages) are commonly implemented on von Neumann architecture systems today, the language's design principles are abstracted from the specifics of any hardware architecture. This abstraction allows Lisp programs to be written in a high-level, machine-independent manner, focusing on algorithmic logic and data manipulation rather than hardware-specific details.
