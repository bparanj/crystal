## Off by One Error

An "off by one" error occurs when a loop iterates one time too many or one time too few. It's a common mistake in programming, especially when dealing with loops and array indices. Here's a simple example in C++ that demonstrates an "off by one" error when trying to access all the elements of an array:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int array[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Intention: Print all elements of the array
    // Off by one error: Loop condition should be i < 5, not i <= 5
    for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
        std::cout << array[i] << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the array `array` has 5 elements, indexed from 0 to 4. The loop is intended to print all elements of the array. However, the loop condition `i <= 5` is incorrect because it causes the loop to attempt to access `array[5]`, which is beyond the bounds of the array (an off by one error). This can lead to undefined behavior, such as accessing random memory or causing a runtime error.

The correct loop condition to access all elements of the array is `i < 5`, ensuring the loop iterates only over valid indices from 0 to 4.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    std::cout << array[i] << std::endl;
}
```

This corrected loop will safely print all the elements in the array without exceeding the array's bounds.
