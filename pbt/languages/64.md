## Lexical Analysis

Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler's processing of source code. It involves scanning the code to identify and categorize sequences of characters into tokens, which are meaningful strings that the compiler understands as distinct elements. These tokens represent identifiers, keywords, operators, literals, and punctuation symbols used in the programming language. Here's a breakdown of the process and its key components:

1. **Tokenization**: The process of breaking down the input source code into a sequence of tokens. A token is the smallest unit that can be meaningful in the source code. For example, in the expression `int x = 10;`, the tokens would be `int`, `x`, `=`, `10`, and `;`.

2. **Identification**: Each token is identified as belonging to a particular category, such as keyword, identifier, literal, or operator. This categorization is crucial for the syntax analysis phase that follows, as it helps the compiler understand the structure and meaning of the code.

3. **Ignoring Whitespaces and Comments**: Lexical analysis also involves removing whitespaces, comments, and other non-essential characters that do not affect the program's logic. This simplification helps in reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed in later stages.

4. **Error Handling**: The lexical analyzer can detect errors that pertain to the lexical phase, such as illegal characters or malformed tokens. When such errors are found, it can report them for correction.

5. **Output**: The output of lexical analysis is a stream of tokens that is passed to the next phase of compilation, which is usually syntax analysis (parsing). This stream represents a simplified, structured version of the original source code that is easier for the compiler to analyze.

Lexical analysis simplifies the source code into a form that is easier for the compiler to understand and manipulate, laying the foundation for the more complex analyses and transformations that follow.
