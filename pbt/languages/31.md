## Assembly Language

List at least three ways in which the use of assembly language represented an improvement for programmers over machine language.

Assembly language brought significant improvements for programmers compared to machine language:

1. **Mnemonic Codes for Operations**: Assembly language uses mnemonic codes or names instead of binary codes. For example, instead of remembering a binary code like `10101000` for an operation, you could use a mnemonic like `ADD` for addition. This is easier to remember, understand, and use, reducing the likelihood of errors.

2. **Easier to Debug and Maintain**: Programs written in assembly language are easier to debug and maintain than those in machine language. The use of symbolic names for operations and addresses allows programmers to understand and follow the logic of the code more easily. This readability is crucial for finding and fixing errors and for modifying the program later.

3. **Symbolic Addresses**: In assembly language, you can use symbolic addresses instead of numerical addresses. This means you can label sections of your code and refer to these labels when you need to jump to different parts of the program. It's much easier and more intuitive than using numeric memory addresses, as required in machine language.

These features make assembly language more user-friendly and less error-prone compared to the direct use of machine language, though it still requires a deep understanding of the computer's architecture.
