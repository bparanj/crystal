Whitehead emphasized the power of abstract notation
in 1911: 

By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems.... Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.

Translating the abstract ideas of a problem domain to the concrete and machine-dependent notation of a program.

Languages with higher levels of abstraction would improve ability to write concise, understandable instructions.
