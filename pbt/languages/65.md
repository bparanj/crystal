## Lexical Error

Let's consider examples in the context of the C programming language, which is widely used and has syntax similar to many other programming languages:

1. **Illegal Characters**: Any character that is not recognized by the language's syntax can cause a lexical error. This might include characters that are not part of the language's alphabet or symbols used incorrectly.

   Example:
   ```c
   int main() {
       int a = 10£;
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   In this case, `£` is an illegal character in C. The C compiler does not recognize `£` as a valid character for variable names or values, resulting in a lexical error.

2. **Malformed Literals**: Literals must conform to the syntax rules defined by the language. For instance, a string literal that is not properly enclosed in quotes or a number with invalid formatting can lead to lexical errors.

   Example:
   ```c
   int main() {
       double num = 123.45.67;
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   Here, `123.45.67` is a malformed literal for a floating-point number because it contains two decimal points, which is not valid syntax for numeric literals in C. The compiler will flag this as a lexical error since it cannot parse the number correctly.

In both examples, the lexical errors stem from violations of the language's lexical conventions, which are typically caught during the lexical analysis phase of compilation.
