## Gathering Statistics

```elixir
  # make verbose for metrics
  property "collect 1", [:verbose] do
    forall bin <- binary() do
      #       test            metric
      collect(is_binary(bin), byte_size(bin))
    end
  end
```

This is a property-based test written in Elixir using the PropCheck library. The test is named "collect 1" and it verifies that the generated binary data is binary and collects the size of the binary data for metrics.

The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. `bin` is a variable that will hold the randomly generated binary data. For each generated binary, the test checks that the data is binary using the `is_binary(bin)` function and collects the size of the binary data using the `byte_size(bin)` function.

The `collect` function is used to collect properties during the execution of a property-based test. It collects a property that the data is binary and the size of the binary data. The `:verbose` option is used to print detailed information about the test execution, including the collected properties, which can be useful for debugging and performance analysis.

## Group by Range

```elixir
 # make verbose for metrics
  property "collect 2", [:verbose] do
    forall bin <- binary() do
      #       test            metric
      collect(is_binary(bin), to_range(10, byte_size(bin)))
    end
  end

  def to_range(m, n) do
    base = div(n, m)
    {base * m, (base + 1) * m}
  end
```

The test is named "collect 2" and it verifies that the generated binary data is binary and collects a range based on the size of the binary data for metrics.

The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. `bin` is a variable that will hold the randomly generated binary data. For each generated binary, the test checks that the data is binary using the `is_binary(bin)` function and collects a range based on the size of the binary data using the `to_range(10, byte_size(bin))` function.

The `to_range` function takes two arguments, `m` and `n`, and returns a range from `base * m` to `(base + 1) * m`, where `base` is `n` divided by `m`. In this case, `m` is 10 and `n` is the size of the binary data. This function is used to create a range of sizes for the binary data.

The `collect` function is used to collect properties during the execution of a property-based test. In this case, it collects a property that the data is binary and a range based on the size of the binary data. The `:verbose` option is used to print detailed information about the test execution, including the collected properties, which can be useful for debugging and performance analysis.

## Aggregate

```elixir
 property "aggregate", [:verbose] do
    suits = [:club, :diamond, :heart, :spade]

    forall hand <- vector(5, {oneof(suits), choose(1, 13)}) do
      # always pass
      aggregate(true, hand)
    end
  end
```

The test is named "aggregate" and it generates a 'hand' of 5 cards, each represented as a tuple with a suit and a rank, and then aggregates these hands for analysis.

The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, `hand` is a variable that will hold the randomly generated values. The `vector(5, {oneof(suits), choose(1, 13)})` generator is used to produce a list of 5 tuples, where each tuple contains a suit (one of `:club`, `:diamond`, `:heart`, or `:spade`) and a rank (an integer between 1 and 13).

For each generated hand, the test passes (since `true` is always true) and aggregates the hand for analysis using the `aggregate` function. The `:verbose` option is used to print detailed information about the test execution, including the aggregated hands, which can be useful for debugging and analysis.

The `aggregate` function is used to collect properties during the execution of a property-based test. In this case, it collects the generated hands. This can be useful for analyzing the distribution of generated test cases, for example, to check that the test cases are diverse and cover a wide range of possible inputs.

## Data Categories

```elixir
  property "fake escaping test showcasing aggregation", [:verbose] do
    forall str <- utf8() do
        aggregate(escape(str), classes(str))
    end
  end

  # this is a check we don't care about
  defp escape(_), do: true

  def classes(str) do
    l = letters(str)
    n = numbers(str)
    p = punctuation(str)
    o = String.length(str) - (l+n+p)
    [{:letters, to_range(5, l)},
     {:numbers, to_range(5, n)},
     {:punctuation, to_range(5, p)},
     {:others, to_range(5, o)}]
  end

  def letters(str) do
    is_letter = fn c -> (c >= ?a && c <= ?z) || (c >= ?A && c <= ?Z) end
    length(for <<c::utf8 <- str>>, is_letter.(c), do: 1)
  end

  def numbers(str) do
    is_num = fn c -> c >= ?0 && c <= ?9 end
    length(for <<c::utf8 <- str>>, is_num.(c), do: 1)
  end

  def punctuation(str) do
    is_punctuation = fn c -> c in '.,;:\'"-' end
    length(for <<c::utf8 <- str>>, is_punctuation.(c), do: 1)
  end
```

The test is named "fake escaping test showcasing aggregation" and it generates a UTF-8 string, applies a dummy escape function to it, and then aggregates the string based on its character classes.

The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, `str` is a variable that will hold the randomly generated UTF-8 strings. For each generated string, the test applies the `escape` function to the string and aggregates the string based on its character classes using the `classes` function.

The `escape` function is a dummy function that always returns `true`. It's used here to illustrate the structure of the test, but in a real test, it would likely perform some kind of operation on the string.

The `classes` function takes a string and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a character class (`:letters`, `:numbers`, `:punctuation`, or `:others`) and a range based on the count of characters in that class. The count of characters in each class is determined by the `letters`, `numbers`, and `punctuation` functions, which use list comprehensions to count the number of letters, numbers, and punctuation characters in the string, respectively. The count of other characters is calculated by subtracting the counts of letters, numbers, and punctuation characters from the total length of the string.

The `aggregate` function is used to collect properties during the execution of a property-based test. In this case, it collects the character classes of the generated strings. The `:verbose` option is used to print detailed information about the test execution, including the aggregated properties, which can be useful for debugging and analysis.

## Resizing Generator

```elixir
  property "resize", [:verbose] do
    forall bin <- resize(150, binary()) do
      collect(is_binary(bin), to_range(10, byte_size(bin)))
    end
  end
```

The test is named "resize" and it generates binary data of a specific size and then verifies that the data is binary and collects a range based on the size of the binary data for metrics.

The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, `bin` is a variable that will hold the randomly generated binary data. The `resize(150, binary())` generator is used to produce binary data of size 150.

For each generated binary, the test checks that the data is binary using the `is_binary(bin)` function and collects a range based on the size of the binary data using the `to_range(10, byte_size(bin))` function. The `to_range` function takes two arguments, `m` and `n`, and returns a range from `base * m` to `(base + 1) * m`, where `base` is `n` divided by `m`. In this case, `m` is 10 and `n` is the size of the binary data. This function is used to create a range of sizes for the binary data.

The `collect` function is used to collect properties during the execution of a property-based test. In this case, it collects a property that the data is binary and a range based on the size of the binary data. The `:verbose` option is used to print detailed information about the test execution, including the collected properties, which can be useful for debugging and performance analysis.

```elixir
  property "profile 1", [:verbose] do
    forall profile <- [
             name: resize(10, utf8()),
             age: pos_integer(),
             bio: resize(350, utf8())
           ] do
      name_len = to_range(10, String.length(profile[:name]))
      bio_len = to_range(300, String.length(profile[:bio]))
      aggregate(true, name: name_len, bio: bio_len)
    end
  end
```

The test is named "profile 1" and it generates a profile with a name, age, and bio, then aggregates the lengths of the name and bio for analysis.

The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, `profile` is a variable that will hold the randomly generated profiles. Each profile is a keyword list with three keys: `:name`, `:age`, and `:bio`. The `:name` and `:bio` are generated as UTF-8 strings with lengths of 10 and 350 respectively, and the `:age` is a positive integer.

For each generated profile, the test calculates a range based on the length of the name and bio using the `to_range` function. The `to_range` function takes two arguments, `m` and `n`, and returns a range from `base * m` to `(base + 1) * m`, where `base` is `n` divided by `m`. In this case, `m` is 10 for the name and 300 for the bio, and `n` is the length of the name and bio respectively.

The `aggregate` function is used to collect properties during the execution of a property-based test. In this case, it collects the ranges of the lengths of the name and bio. The `:verbose` option is used to print detailed information about the test execution, including the aggregated properties, which can be useful for debugging and analysis.

```elixir
 property "profile 2", [:verbose] do
    forall profile <- [
             name: utf8(),
             age: pos_integer(),
             bio: sized(s, resize(s * 35, utf8()))
           ] do
      name_len = to_range(10, String.length(profile[:name]))
      bio_len = to_range(300, String.length(profile[:bio]))
      aggregate(true, name: name_len, bio: bio_len)
    end
  end
```

The test is named "profile 2" and it generates a profile with a name, age, and bio, then aggregates the lengths of the name and bio for analysis.

The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, `profile` is a variable that will hold the randomly generated profiles. Each profile is a keyword list with three keys: `:name`, `:age`, and `:bio`. The `:name` is generated as a UTF-8 string, the `:age` is a positive integer, and the `:bio` is a UTF-8 string with a length that is 35 times the size `s`.

The `sized` function is used to generate a value based on the size of the test case. It's used to generate a string with a length that is proportional to the size of the test case. The `resize` function is used to adjust the size of the generated value. In this case, it's used to adjust the size of the generated string to be `s * 35`.

For each generated profile, the test calculates a range based on the length of the name and bio using the `to_range` function. The `to_range` function takes two arguments, `m` and `n`, and returns a range from `base * m` to `(base + 1) * m`, where `base` is `n` divided by `m`. In this case, `m` is 10 for the name and 300 for the bio, and `n` is the length of the name and bio respectively.

The `aggregate` function is used to collect properties during the execution of a property-based test. In this case, it collects the ranges of the lengths of the name and bio. The `:verbose` option is used to print detailed information about the test execution, including the aggregated properties, which can be useful for debugging and analysis.
