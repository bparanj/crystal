In Haskell, a function is considered pure if it satisfies two main conditions:

1. **Deterministic Output**: Given the same inputs, the function always produces the same output.
2. **No Side Effects**: The function does not interact with the outside world (like reading from or writing to a file, modifying a global state, or printing to a console), which means it does not change the state of the program or its environment.

Printing a string to the console is considered not pure because it violates the second condition: it produces a side effect. Specifically, it interacts with the outside world by changing the state of the console (by writing to it). This side effect means that the act of printing cannot be confined to the function itself; it reaches out and modifies something external.

Haskell handles these impure actions through the use of monads, like `IO`. An `IO` action encapsulates a computation that interacts with the outside world. When a Haskell program runs, these `IO` actions are executed by the runtime system, allowing the program to perform side effects in a controlled manner. This design allows Haskell to maintain purity in its functions while still interacting with the external world when necessary.

For example, the type signature of a function that prints a string to the console in Haskell would be:
```haskell
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
```
This signature explicitly indicates that `putStrLn` takes a `String` as an input and returns an `IO` action that produces no value (`()` is the unit type, akin to `void` in other languages). The `IO` type signals that this function performs an IO action (a side effect), distinguishing it from pure functions.

## Side Effect

The term "side effect" is used in computing to describe any operation, function, or expression that modifies some state or interacts with the outside world, beyond returning a value to the caller. The concept comes from the observation that these actions are ancillary to the primary purpose of the function, which is to compute and return a value. Thus, any additional impact it has—such as modifying a global variable, writing to a disk, printing to a console, or changing the program's environment in any way—is considered to be "on the side," hence a "side effect."

In pure functional programming, functions are expected to be like mathematical functions: the output is determined solely by the inputs, without any mutable state or external interaction. This makes reasoning about programs easier because the function's behavior is predictable and depends only on its inputs. In this context, side effects are significant because they represent departures from this ideal. They introduce dependencies on the sequence of operations (since side effects depend on the order in which they are performed) and on external state, making the function's behavior less predictable and harder to reason about.

In summary, the term "side effect" underscores the distinction between the primary effect of computing a value and any other effects that occur during the computation, which are not essential to the computation's goal but may affect the program or its environment in other ways.
