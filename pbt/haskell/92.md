## Haskell Function Application

In Haskell, the `$` sign is an operator that is used for function application, similar to using spaces, but with a key difference in how it affects parentheses. The `$` operator has a low, right-associative precedence, which allows it to be used to reduce the number of parentheses needed in expressions. Here's how it works:

### Basic Function Application

In Haskell, applying a function to its arguments is usually done by placing the arguments after the function name, separated by spaces. For example, `f x y` applies the function `f` to the arguments `x` and `y`.

### Using Parentheses

If you want to apply a function to the result of another function or a complex expression, you often need to use parentheses to ensure proper order of evaluation. For example:

```haskell
f (g x)
```

This applies `g` to `x`, and then `f` to the result of `g x`. Without parentheses, `f g x` would be interpreted as applying `f` to `g` and `x` as separate arguments, which is not the intended meaning.

### Using `$`

The `$` operator lets you write the same expression without parentheses by ensuring that everything to the right of `$` is evaluated first:

```haskell
f $ g x
```

This has the same meaning as `f (g x)`, applying `g` to `x`, and then `f` to the result. The `$` operator is particularly useful in longer expressions, making them easier to read by reducing the clutter of parentheses.

### Example with `classify`

In the context of your provided code:

```haskell
ordered xs ==> classify (null xs) "trivial" $ ordered (insert x xs)
```

The `$` is used to apply `classify (null xs) "trivial"` to the result of `ordered (insert x xs)`. Without `$`, you would need to use parentheses around the `ordered (insert x xs)` expression:

```haskell
ordered xs ==> classify (null xs) "trivial" (ordered (insert x xs))
```

By using `$`, the code is made clearer and easier to read, especially in complex expressions.

### Infix

$ is Haskell's infix function application.

### Infix

In the context of programming languages, "infix" refers to the notation or syntax where the operator is placed between its operands. This is the most common notation used in arithmetic and logical expressions in many programming languages and mathematical formulations. Infix notation contrasts with "prefix" notation (where the operator comes before the operands, also known as Polish notation) and "postfix" notation (where the operator comes after the operands, also known as Reverse Polish notation).

### Examples of Infix Notation

In infix notation, an addition operation would be written as follows:

```
operand1 + operand2
```

Here, `+` is the infix operator, and `operand1` and `operand2` are its operands.

For a more complex expression involving multiplication and addition:

```
a + b * c
```

In this case, `+` and `*` are infix operators. The order of operations (precedence and associativity rules) determines that `b * c` is evaluated before adding `a` to the result.

### Comparison with Prefix and Postfix

To illustrate the difference, consider the infix expression `a + b`. In other notations, it would be:

- **Prefix (Polish notation)**: `+ a b`
- **Postfix (Reverse Polish notation)**: `a b +`

### Infix in Programming Languages

Most programming languages use infix notation for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations because it is familiar and intuitive to those with a basic understanding of mathematics. However, in some contexts, especially in functional programming or when evaluating expressions in a stack-based manner, prefix or postfix notation might be preferred for their simplicity and ease of parsing.

### Special Consideration for Infix Operators in Functional Languages

In some functional languages like Haskell, operators can be used in an infix position by default (e.g., `1 + 2`) or turned into prefix functions by enclosing them in parentheses (`(+) 1 2`). Conversely, functions that are normally prefix can be used in an infix manner by enclosing them in backticks (e.g., ``a `f` b``).

In summary, "infix" denotes a syntactic convention that places operators between their operands, making expressions readable and mathematically intuitive.
