## Creating Modules

Each file contains one module. Each module is defined by a single file. The name of the file that defines the module match the name of the module.

Modules exist in a hierarchy that mirrors the directory structure of the source files. Each subdirectory adds a new section to the module name.

The relationship between the file path and module name is relative to the source directory of the application. 

Add new module to the exposed-modules section of the cabal file to make it available to any consumers of the library. The other-modules section is used for internal use within the library. Include the source directory src or app in the hs-source-dirs section under library:

```
library
  hs-source-dirs:      app
  exposed-modules:     HundredDoors
  build-depends:       base >= 4.7 && < 5
  default-language:    Haskell2010
```

Running a specific test:

```
cabal test hundred-doors-tests
```

or

```
cabal test spec
```

Run all tests:

```
cabal test
```
