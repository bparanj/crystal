Type inference in Haskell is a feature of the compiler that automatically determines the types of expressions without needing the programmer to explicitly annotate them. Haskell's type system is quite powerful and can deduce the types of variables, functions, and expressions based on how they are used throughout the program. This allows for concise and expressive code while still maintaining the safety and reliability benefits of static typing.

### How Type Inference Works

1. **Analysis of Definitions and Uses**: The compiler examines the definitions of all functions and variables, as well as where and how they are used. By analyzing the operations performed on these entities and their interactions with each other, the compiler can infer what types they must be.

2. **Type Constraints**: During the inference process, the compiler generates a set of constraints for each expression based on the operations applied to it. For example, if an operation is only valid for numeric types, the compiler infers that the operands must be of a numeric type.

3. **Unification**: The compiler tries to find the most general type that satisfies all constraints for a given expression without causing type errors. This process is known as unification and is central to Haskell's type inference.

### Example

Consider the following Haskell function without explicit type annotations:

```haskell
sumNumbers x y = x + y
```

From this definition, the compiler can infer that:

- `x` and `y` must be of a type that supports addition.
- The function `sumNumbers` takes two arguments of the same type and returns a value of that same type.
- Given Haskell's defaulting rules and the use of `+`, it might infer that `x`, `y`, and the return type are all of type `Num a => a`, which means any type `a` that has an instance of the `Num` type class.

### Benefits of Type Inference

- **Conciseness**: Programmers can write less code by not specifying types everywhere, making code more concise and easier to read and write.
- **Flexibility**: Functions can automatically work with a wider range of types without extra effort from the programmer, as long as the operations within them are valid for those types.
- **Safety**: Despite the lack of explicit type annotations, the Haskell compiler ensures type safety by inferring and checking types.

### Limitations

While powerful, type inference in Haskell has its limitations. There are situations where the compiler cannot infer a specific type due to ambiguities or overly general usage. In these cases, the compiler may either default to a specific type (if applicable) or require the programmer to provide explicit type annotations to disambiguate.

Type inference is one of the key features that make Haskell both powerful and user-friendly, enabling both strong type safety and a high degree of expressiveness in the language.
