To determine if each expression can be reduced to a normal form or if it diverges, we need to understand if the expression can be simplified to a point where no further reductions are possible (reaching normal form), or if the process of simplification will continue indefinitely without reaching a final form (divergence).

1. **洧랝洧논.洧논洧논洧논**
   - **Normal Form.** This expression is already in normal form because there are no beta reductions to apply. It's a lambda function waiting for an argument, and without applying it to an argument, it stands as is.

2. **(洧랝洧녾.洧녾洧녾)(洧랝洧녽.洧녽洧녽)**
   - **Diverges.** Applying beta reduction, we try to replace \(z\) in the body \(zz\) with \(\lambda y.yy\). This gives us \((\lambda y.yy)(\lambda y.yy)\), which is the original expression applied to itself. Attempting to simplify this expression results in an infinite loop of self-application, so it diverges and cannot reach a normal form.

3. **(洧랝洧논.洧논洧논洧논)洧녾**
   - **Normal Form (potentially).** This depends on the context for \(z\). If \(z\) is a free variable (not further defined within our discussion), then applying beta reduction would simply replace \(x\) with \(z\) in the body \(xxx\), resulting in \(zzz\). Since there are no further reductions to apply (assuming \(z\) does not represent a function that can be applied), \(zzz\) would be considered its normal form. However, if \(z\) is itself a lambda expression that can lead to further reductions, the outcome might change. Without additional information on \(z\), \(zzz\) is taken as the normal form under the assumption that \(z\) is a simple variable or value not leading to further reductions.

### Summary

- **洧랝洧논.洧논洧논洧논** is already in normal form.
- **(洧랝洧녾.洧녾洧녾)(洧랝洧녽.洧녽洧녽)** diverges due to an infinite loop of self-application.
- **(洧랝洧논.洧논洧논洧논)洧녾** potentially reaches a normal form as \(zzz\), assuming \(z\) does not introduce further reductions.
