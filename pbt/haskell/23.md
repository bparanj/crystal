## Reverse a List

To implement a function that reverses a list using `foldl` in Haskell, you can use the concept of folding from the left while building up a new list in reverse order. Here's how you can do it:

```haskell
reverseList :: [a] -> [a]
reverseList = foldl (flip (:)) []
```

Explanation:
- `foldl` is a function that takes a function, an initial accumulator (in this case, an empty list `[]`), and a list to fold.
- `(flip (:))` is the function passed to `foldl`. Normally, `(:)` takes an element and a list and conses the element to the front of the list. `flip` switches the arguments of `(:)`, so instead of putting the new element at the front of the list, it builds up the list in reverse. 
- Each step of the fold takes the next element of the input list and puts it at the front of the accumulating list, effectively reversing the list.

### foldl

Main.hs:

```
module Main where

reverseList :: [a] -> [a]
reverseList = foldl (flip (:)) []

main :: IO ()
main = print $ reverseList [1,2,3,4,5]
```

Run in console:

```
load: Main
main
```

### foldr

To reverse a list in Haskell using `foldr`, you can define a function that folds the list from the right, accumulating the elements in reverse order. Here's the implementation:

```haskell
reverseList :: [a] -> [a]
reverseList = foldr (\x acc -> acc ++ [x]) []
```

In this function:
- `foldr` takes a function, an initial accumulator (empty list `[]` in this case), and a list to fold.
- The lambda function `(\x acc -> acc ++ [x])` appends each element to the end of the accumulator, effectively reversing the list as it folds from the right.

Main.hs:

```haskell
module Main where

reverseList :: [a] -> [a]
reverseList = foldr (\x acc -> acc ++ [x]) []

main :: IO ()
main = print $ reverseList [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
```

Output:

```
ghci> main
[5,4,3,2,1]
ghci> :load Main
[1 of 2] Compiling Main             ( Main.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.
ghci> main
[7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
```
