## Custom Generators

### Custom Edge Case Generator

```ruby
# Custom method to generate edge cases for integers
def integer_edge_cases
  [0, -1, Integer::MAX, Integer::MIN, rand(Integer::MAX)]
end

# Custom method to generate edge cases for strings
def string_edge_cases
  ['', ' ' * 255, "\n", "\t", rand(36**10).to_s(36)] # Random alphanumeric string
end

# Usage
integer_edge_cases.each do |num|
  puts "Testing with integer edge case: #{num}"
  # test logic here
end

string_edge_cases.each do |str|
  puts "Testing with string edge case: #{str.inspect}"
  # test logic here
end
```

Is it possible to write a custom generator for rantly gem that is useful to cover all the edge cases for a given data type?

## My Cousin Vinny

Yes, you can write a custom generator with the Rantly gem in Ruby to cover specific edge cases for a given data type. Rantly's flexibility allows you to define custom generation rules, which can be tailored to target particular edge cases that you are concerned about. Hereâ€™s a general approach to creating a custom generator in Rantly:

### Understanding Rantly's Basics

Rantly works by defining a generator which can create random data based on the rules you provide. The basic use involves calling Rantly's methods like `string`, `range`, `array`, etc., which generate random data of the specified type.

### Writing a Custom Generator

1. **Define Specific Edge Cases**: First, identify the edge cases for your data type. For example, if you're dealing

with strings, edge cases might include empty strings, strings of maximum length, strings with special characters, etc.

2. **Use Rantly's DSL**: Rantly provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for defining custom generation rules. Use this DSL to create a generator that encompasses your identified edge cases.

This is not applicable here. 

3. **Combining Generators**: You can combine standard Rantly generators with your custom logic to create more complex scenarios. For instance, you might have a generator for normal cases and another for edge cases, and then randomly choose between them.

### Example: Custom String Generator

Here's a simple example of a custom generator for string edge cases:

```ruby
require 'rantly'
require 'rantly/property'
require 'rantly/shrinks'

Rantly.singleton_class.define_method(:custom_string) do
  freq(
    [1, :literal, ''],           # Empty string (edge case)
    [1, :literal, 'a' * 255],    # Very long string (edge case)
    [3, :string]                 # Regular random string (more common case)
  )
end

# Usage
test_string = Rantly { custom_string }
puts test_string
```

In this example, `freq` is used to define a frequency distribution for different types of strings. The `:literal` directive is used to specify exact string values (edge cases), and `:string` generates a regular random string.

### Testing with the Custom Generator

- **Integrate into Tests**: Use your custom generator in your property-based tests.
- **Observe Results**: Run your tests and observe if the edge cases are being generated and tested as expected.
- **Iterate and Improve**: Based on test results, you might need to iterate on your generator to better cover edge cases or to adjust the frequency of edge case generation.

### Conclusion

Custom generators in Rantly are a powerful way to ensure that your tests cover both typical cases and specific edge cases. While you can target known edge cases, it's challenging to cover all edge cases, especially for complex data types or when the range of possible edge cases is vast or not well-defined.
