## Creating Modules

Each file contains one module. Each module is defined by a single file. The name of the file that defines the module match the name of the module.

Modules exist in a hierarchy that mirrors the directory structure of the source files. Each subdirectory adds a new section to the module name.

The relationship between the file path and module name is relative to the source directory of the application. 

Add new module to the exposed-modules section of the cabal file to make it available to any consumers of the library. The other-modules section is used for internal use within the library.
