## Imposing Restrictions

```elixir
def non_empty(list_type) do
	such_that l <- list_type, when: l != [] and l != <<>>
end

def non_empty_map(gen) do
	such_that g <- gen, when: g != %{}
end
```

The `non_empty` function is a custom generator that generates non-empty lists or binaries. It uses the `such_that` macro from the PropCheck library to define a generator that depends on the value of another generator and a condition. In this case, it generates a list or binary using the `list_type` generator and ensures that the generated value is not an empty list `[]` or an empty binary `<<>>`.

The `non_empty_map` function is a similar custom generator that generates non-empty maps. It also uses the `such_that` macro to define a generator that depends on the value of another generator and a condition. In this case, it generates a map using the `gen` generator and ensures that the generated value is not an empty map `%{}`.

These functions are useful when you want to generate test cases that meet certain conditions. In this case, the conditions are that the generated lists, binaries, and maps must not be empty.

## Changing Probabilities

```elixir
  def text_like() do
    let l <-
          list(
            frequency([
              {80, range(?a, ?z)},
              {10, ?\s},
              {1, ?\n},
              {1, oneof([?., ?-, ?!, ??, ?,])},
              {1, range(?0, ?9)}
            ])
          ) do
      to_string(l)
    end
  end
```

The function `text_like` is a custom generator that generates text-like strings.

The `let` macro is used to define a generator that depends on the value of another generator. In this case, it generates a list of characters using the `list` function and the `frequency` generator.

The `frequency` generator is used to generate a value from a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a weight and a generator. The generator for a tuple is chosen with a probability proportional to its weight. In this case, the `frequency` generator is used to generate a character with a certain frequency.

The weights and generators are as follows:
- 80% of the time, it generates a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z' (`range(?a, ?z)`).
- 10% of the time, it generates a space character (`?\s`).
- 1% of the time, it generates a newline character (`?\n`).
- 1% of the time, it generates one of the punctuation characters `., -, !, ?, ,` (`oneof([?., ?-, ?!, ??, ?,])`).
- 1% of the time, it generates a digit between '0' and '9' (`range(?0, ?9)`).

After generating the list of characters, the `let` macro uses the `do` block to convert the list of characters into a string using the `to_string(l)` function.

This is a good example of how to use property-based testing to generate complex, realistic test data. It generates a large number of text-like strings with random characters and checks that a function behaves as expected with all these inputs. 

```elixir
  def mostly_sorted() do
    gen = list(
      frequency([
        {5, sorted_list()},
        {1, list()}
      ])
    )
    let lists <- gen, do: Enum.concat(lists)
  end
```

This function is a custom generator that generates a list which is mostly sorted.

The `list` function is used with the `frequency` generator to create a list of lists. The `frequency` generator is used to generate a value from a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a weight and a generator. The generator for a tuple is chosen with a probability proportional to its weight.

In this case, the weights and generators are as follows:
- 5 times out of 6, it generates a sorted list (`sorted_list()`).
- 1 time out of 6, it generates a list with no specific order (`list()`).

After generating the list of lists, the `let` macro is used to flatten the list of lists into a single list using the `Enum.concat(lists)` function.

This function is an example of how to use property-based testing to generate complex, realistic test data. It generates a large number of mostly sorted lists and checks that a function behaves as expected with all these inputs.

```ruby
  def sorted_list() do
    let l <- list(), do: Enum.sort(l)
  end
```

This function is a custom generator that generates a sorted list. The `let` macro is used to define a generator that depends on the value of another generator. In this case, it generates a list using the `list()` generator, then sorts the list using the `Enum.sort(l)` function.

The `list()` generator is a built-in generator in PropCheck that generates a list of any values. The `Enum.sort(l)` function is a built-in function in Elixir that sorts a list in ascending order (from smallest to largest).

This function is an example of how to use property-based testing to generate complex, realistic test data. It generates a large number of sorted lists and checks that a function behaves as expected with all these inputs.
