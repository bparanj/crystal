```elixir
  property "a sorted list has ordered pairs" do
    forall list <- list(term()) do
      is_ordered(Enum.sort(list))
    end
  end

  def is_ordered([a, b | t]) do
    a <= b and is_ordered([b | t])
  end

  # lists with fewer than 2 elements
  def is_ordered(_) do
    true
  end
```

This is a property-based test written in Elixir using the PropCheck library. The test is named "a sorted list has ordered pairs" and it verifies that the `Enum.sort` function correctly sorts a list in ascending order.

The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, `list` is a variable that will hold the randomly generated values, and `list(term())` is a generator that produces lists of any Elixir terms. For each generated list, the test sorts the list using `Enum.sort(list)` and asserts that the sorted list is ordered using the `is_ordered` function.

The `is_ordered` function is defined with two clauses. The first clause matches when the list has at least two elements. It checks that the first element is less than or equal to the second element and then calls itself recursively with the rest of the list, starting from the second element. This effectively checks that each pair of consecutive elements in the list is in ascending order.

The second clause of `is_ordered` matches when the list has fewer than two elements. In this case, it returns `true`, because a list with fewer than two elements is trivially ordered.

This test is a good example of how to use property-based testing to verify the correctness of a function. It generates a large number of test cases with random inputs and checks that the function behaves as expected in all cases. This can help catch edge cases and other issues that might not be caught with traditional example-based tests.

```elixir
property "a sorted list keeps its size" do
    forall l <- list(number()) do
      length(l) == length(Enum.sort(l))
    end
  end

  property "no element added" do
    forall l <- list(number()) do
      sorted = Enum.sort(l)
      Enum.all?(sorted, fn element -> element in l end)
    end
  end

  property "no element deleted" do
    forall l <- list(number()) do
      sorted = Enum.sort(l)
      Enum.all?(l, fn element -> element in sorted end)
    end
  end
```

These tests are verifying properties of the `Enum.sort` function, which sorts a list in ascending order.

The first test, "a sorted list keeps its size", checks that sorting a list does not change its size. It generates random lists of numbers and for each list, it asserts that the length of the list is equal to the length of the sorted list.

The second test, "no element added", checks that sorting a list does not add any elements to the list. It generates random lists of numbers and for each list, it sorts the list and then checks that every element in the sorted list is also in the original list. This is done using the `Enum.all?` function, which checks that a condition holds for all elements in a list.

The third test, "no element deleted", checks that sorting a list does not remove any elements from the list. It generates random lists of numbers and for each list, it sorts the list and then checks that every element in the original list is also in the sorted list.

These tests are good examples of how to use property-based testing to verify the correctness of a function. They generate a large number of test cases with random inputs and check that the function behaves as expected in all cases. This can help catch edge cases and other issues that might not be caught with traditional example-based tests.
