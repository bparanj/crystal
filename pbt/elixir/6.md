## Default Generator

```elixir
  property "find all keys in a map even when dupes are used", [:verbose] do
    forall kv <- list({key(), val()}) do
      m = Map.new(kv)
      for {k,_v} <- kv, do: Map.fetch!(m, k)
      uniques =
        kv
          |> List.keysort(0)
          |> Enum.dedup_by(fn {x, _} -> x end)
      collect(true, {:dupes, to_range(5, length(kv) - length(uniques))})
    end
  end

  def key(), do: oneof([range(1,10), integer()])
  def val(), do: term()
```

This is a property-based test written in Elixir using the PropCheck library. The test is named "find all keys in a map even when dupes are used" and it verifies that all keys can be found in a map, even when there are duplicate keys.

```elixir
  property "find all keys in a map even when dupes are used", [:verbose] do
    forall kv <- list({key(), val()}) do
```

The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, `kv` is a variable that will hold the randomly generated values, and `list({key(), val()})` is a generator that produces lists of key-value pairs. For each generated list, the test creates a new map `m` from the list of key-value pairs and then checks that each key in the original list can be fetched from the map.

```elixir
      m = Map.new(kv)
      for {k,_v} <- kv, do: Map.fetch!(m, k)
      uniques =
        kv
          |> List.keysort(0)
          |> Enum.dedup_by(fn {x, _} -> x end)
```

The test also checks that the number of unique keys in the original list is within a certain range. It sorts the list of key-value pairs by key, removes duplicates based on the key, and then collects a property that the number of duplicates is within the range from 5 to the difference between the length of the original list and the length of the list of unique keys.

```elixir
      collect(true, {:dupes, to_range(5, length(kv) - length(uniques))})
```

The `collect` function is used to collect properties during the execution of a property-based test. In this case, it collects a property that the number of duplicates is within a certain range. The `:verbose` option is used to print detailed information about the test execution, which can be useful for debugging.

This test is a good example of how to use property-based testing to verify the correctness of a function. It generates a large number of test cases with random inputs and checks that the function behaves as expected in all cases. This can help catch edge cases and other issues that might not be caught with traditional example-based tests.

## Pipe Operator

The `|>` symbol in Elixir is called the pipe operator. It is used to chain function calls in a way that is easy to read and understand. The result of the expression on the left side of the pipe operator is passed as the first argument to the function call on the right side.

For example, in the line `kv |> List.keysort(0) |> Enum.dedup_by(fn {x, _} -> x end)`, the list `kv` is first passed to the `List.keysort(0)` function, and then the result of that is passed to the `Enum.dedup_by(fn {x, _} -> x end)` function. This is equivalent to `Enum.dedup_by(List.keysort(kv, 0), fn {x, _} -> x end)`, but the version with the pipe operator is often easier to read, especially when there are many function calls chained together.
