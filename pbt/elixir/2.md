## PBT Structure

```elixir
defmodule PbtTest do 
	use ExUnit.Case 
	use PropCheck

	# Properties
	property "description of what the property does" do 
		forall type <- my_type() do
			boolean(type)
		end
	end 
	# Helpers
	defp boolean(_) do 
		true
	end
	# Generators
	def my_type() do 
		term()
	end 
end
```

This is a test module written in Elixir using the ExUnit and PropCheck libraries. ExUnit is Elixir's built-in test framework, while PropCheck is a library for property-based testing, a testing method that verifies the properties of a system hold for a large set of randomly generated inputs.

The module is named `PbtTest`. The `use ExUnit.Case` line includes the necessary functions and macros from ExUnit to write tests, while `use PropCheck` does the same for PropCheck.

The `property` macro is used to define a property-based test. The test name is "description of what the property does". The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, `type` is a variable that will hold the randomly generated values, and `my_type()` is a generator that produces these values. For each generated value, the test asserts that the `boolean` function returns `true`.

The `boolean` function is a private helper function defined with a single clause that matches any input (`_` is a wildcard in Elixir that matches anything) and always returns `true`.

The `my_type` function is a generator that produces random Elixir terms. In PropCheck, a generator is a function that produces random data of a certain type. The `term()` function is a built-in generator that produces any Elixir term.

This code is a simple example of how to use property-based testing in Elixir. It doesn't test any properties of the system. The `boolean` function is also not very useful because it doesn't do anything with its input. This code is used as a starting point for a more complex test.

## Property Structure

```elixir
property "some description" do
	forall instance_of_type <- type_generator do
		property_expression
	end 
end
```

This is a property-based test written in Elixir using the PropCheck library. Property-based testing is a method that verifies the properties of a system hold for a large set of randomly generated inputs.

The `property` macro is used to define a property-based test. The test is named "some description". The name of the test should ideally describe the property that the test is verifying.

Inside the `property` macro, the `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, `instance_of_type` is a variable that will hold the randomly generated values, and `type_generator` is a generator that produces these values. Generators are functions or macros that produce random data of a certain type. The specific generator to use depends on the property to test.

The `property_expression` is the actual test that is run for each generated value. This is typically an assertion that checks a certain property of the system. The specific expression to use depends on the property to test.

This code is a template for a property-based test in Elixir. To turn it into a real test, you would need to replace "some description" with a description of the property you're testing, `type_generator` with a real generator, and `property_expression` with an expression that tests the property.

## Property Test Structure

```elixir
defmodule PbtTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  use PropCheck

  property "always works" do
    forall type <- term() do
      boolean(type)
    end
  end

  def boolean(_) do
    true
  end
end
```

This is a test module written in Elixir using the ExUnit and PropCheck libraries. ExUnit is Elixir's built-in test framework, while PropCheck is a library for property-based testing, a testing method that verifies the properties of a system hold for a large set of randomly generated inputs.

```elixir
defmodule PbtTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  use PropCheck
```

The module is named `PbtTest`. The `use ExUnit.Case` line includes the necessary functions and macros from ExUnit to write tests, while `use PropCheck` does the same for PropCheck.

```elixir
  property "always works" do
    forall type <- term() do
      boolean(type)
    end
  end
```

The `property` macro is used to define a property-based test. The test is named "always works". The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, `type` is any Elixir term. For each generated term, the test asserts that the `boolean` function returns `true`.

```elixir
  def boolean(_) do
    true
  end
```

The `boolean` function is defined with a single clause that matches any input (`_` is a wildcard in Elixir that matches anything) and always returns `true`.

This code is a simple example of how to use property-based testing in Elixir. However, the test is not very meaningful because it doesn't actually test any properties of the system. The `boolean` function is also not very useful because it doesn't do anything with its input. This code is used as a starting point for a more complex test.

## Sequential Number Generation within a Range

```elixir
defmodule ExercisesTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  use PropCheck

  property "exercise 2: a sample" do
    forall {start, count} <- {integer(), non_neg_integer()} do
      list = Enum.to_list(start..(start + count))
      count + 1 == length(list) and increments(list)
    end
  end

  def increments([head | tail]), do: increments(head, tail)

  defp increments(_, []), do: true

  defp increments(n, [head | tail]) when head == n + 1,
    do: increments(head, tail)

  defp increments(_, _), do: false
end
```

The active selection is a test module written in Elixir using the ExUnit and PropCheck libraries. ExUnit is Elixir's built-in test framework, while PropCheck is a library for property-based testing, a testing method that verifies the properties of a system hold for a large set of randomly generated inputs.

The module is named `ExercisesTest`. The `use ExUnit.Case` line includes the necessary functions and macros from ExUnit to write tests, while `use PropCheck` does the same for PropCheck.

The `property` macro is used to define a property-based test. In this case, the test is named "exercise 2: a sample". The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, a tuple `{start, count}` is generated where `start` is any integer and `count` is a non-negative integer. For each generated tuple, the test creates a list of integers from `start` to `start + count` and asserts that the length of the list is `count + 1` and that the list increments by 1 for each element.

The `increments` function is defined with two clauses. The first clause matches when the input is a non-empty list. It starts the process of checking the increments by calling a helper function with the head of the list and the tail of the list.

The helper function `increments` is defined with three private (`defp`) clauses. The first clause matches when the list is empty, in which case it returns `true`. The other two clauses match when the list is non-empty. They compare the head of the list with the previous number plus one and call the helper function recursively with the tail of the list. If the head of the list is equal to the previous number plus one, it continues with the next element, otherwise, it returns `false`.

This code is a good example of how to use property-based testing in Elixir. It also demonstrates the use of recursion and pattern matching to process lists, which are common techniques in functional programming.

The functionality being tested in this code is the creation of a list of integers that starts from a certain number (`start`) and has a certain length (`count + 1`), and that each number in the list increments by 1 from the previous number.

The test generates random pairs of integers where the first integer is any integer (`start`) and the second integer is a non-negative integer (`count`). For each pair, it creates a list of integers from `start` to `start + count` and checks two properties:

1. The length of the list is `count + 1`. This checks that the list has the correct length.
2. The list increments by 1 for each element. This is checked by the `increments` function, which uses recursion to go through the list and checks that each number is 1 greater than the previous number.

If both properties hold for all generated pairs of integers, the test passes. If any property does not hold for a generated pair, the test fails.

At a higher level of abstraction, this functionality can be referred to as "Sequential Number Generation and Verification". The code generates a sequence of numbers starting from a given number (`start`) and verifies that the sequence is incrementing by 1 for each subsequent number, up to a given count. The verification also includes checking that the sequence has the correct length.

Yes, the code is generating a range of numbers. The `start` value is randomly generated as any integer, and the `count` is a non-negative integer. The range is then from `start` to `start + count`. This range is converted to a list with the `Enum.to_list(start..(start + count))` line. The test then verifies that the list has the correct length (`count + 1`) and that each number in the list increments by 1 from the previous number.
