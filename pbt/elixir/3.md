## Modeling

Library to find biggest:

```elixir
defmodule Pbt do
  def biggest([head | tail]) do
    biggest(tail, head)
  end

  defp biggest([], max) do
    max
  end

  defp biggest([head | tail], max) when head >= max do
    biggest(tail, head)
  end

  defp biggest([head | tail], max) when head < max do
    biggest(tail, max)
  end

end
```

This is a module written in Elixir named `Pbt`. This module contains a public function `biggest/1` and three private helper functions, all named `biggest` but with different arities and patterns.

The public function `biggest/1` takes a list of numbers as its argument. It uses pattern matching to separate the list into its head (the first element) and tail (the rest of the list). It then calls a helper function, passing the tail of the list and the head of the list as the initial maximum value.

The helper function `biggest/2` is defined with three clauses. The first clause matches when the list is empty. In this case, it returns the current maximum value, effectively ending the recursion.

The second clause of `biggest/2` matches when the list is not empty and the head of the list is greater than or equal to the current maximum value. In this case, it calls itself recursively with the tail of the list and the head of the list as the new maximum value.

The third clause of `biggest/2` matches when the list is not empty and the head of the list is less than the current maximum value. In this case, it calls itself recursively with the tail of the list and the current maximum value.

In summary, this module provides a function to find the largest number in a list. It uses recursion and pattern matching, which are common techniques in functional programming. The function assumes that the list is non-empty and contains only numbers. If the list is empty or contains non-number elements, the function will not work correctly.

```elixir
  property "finds biggest element" do
    forall x <- non_empty(list(integer())) do
      Pbt.biggest(x) == model_biggest(x)
    end
  end

  def model_biggest(list) do
    List.last(Enum.sort(list))
  end
```

This is a property-based test written in Elixir using the PropCheck library. The test is named "finds biggest element" and it verifies that the `biggest` function in the `Pbt` module correctly finds the largest number in a list.

The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, `x` is a variable that will hold the randomly generated values, and `non_empty(list(integer()))` is a generator that produces non-empty lists of integers. For each generated list, the test asserts that the `Pbt.biggest(x)` function returns the same result as the `model_biggest(x)` function.

The `model_biggest` function is a model or reference implementation of the functionality being tested. It sorts the list in ascending order using `Enum.sort(list)` and then returns the last element of the sorted list using `List.last`. This is a simple and straightforward way to find the largest number in a list, but it is not be the most efficient way for large lists.

This test is a good example of how to use property-based testing to verify the correctness of a function. It generates a large number of test cases with random inputs and checks that the function under test behaves the same as a reference implementation. This can help catch edge cases and other issues that might not be caught with traditional example-based tests.

## Notes

```elixir
defmodule PbtTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  use PropCheck

  property "finds biggest element" do
    forall x <- non_empty(list(integer())) do #(1)
      biggest(x) == List.last(Enum.sort(x))
    end
  end


  def biggest([head | tail]) do
    biggest(tail, head)
  end

  defp biggest([], max) do
    max
  end

  defp biggest([head | tail], max) when head >= max do #(2)
    biggest(tail, head)
  end

  defp biggest([head | tail], max) when head < max do
    biggest(tail, max)
  end

end
```

## Generalizing Example Tests

Look at example based tests and see if it can be generalized into a property.

```elixir
  property "picks the last number" do
    forall {list, known_last} <- {list(number()), number()} do
      known_list = list ++ [known_last]
      known_last == List.last(known_list)
    end
  end
```

This is a property-based test written in Elixir using the PropCheck library. The test is named "picks the last number" and it verifies that the `List.last` function correctly returns the last element in a list.

The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, a tuple `{list, known_last}` is generated where `list` is any list of numbers and `known_last` is any number. For each generated tuple, the test creates a new list `known_list` by appending `known_last` to the end of `list` and asserts that `List.last(known_list)` returns `known_last`.

This test is checking that the `List.last` function, a built-in Elixir function, correctly returns the last element of a list. It does this by generating a large number of random lists and known last elements, appending the known last element to the list, and checking that `List.last` returns the known last element.

This test is a good example of how to use property-based testing to verify the correctness of a function. It generates a large number of test cases with random inputs and checks that the function behaves as expected in all cases. This can help catch edge cases and other issues that might not be caught with traditional example-based tests.

## Explanation

```elixir
defmodule PbtTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  use PropCheck
```

This is a test module written in Elixir using the ExUnit and PropCheck libraries. ExUnit is Elixir's built-in test framework, while PropCheck is a library for property-based testing, a testing method that verifies the properties of a system hold for a large set of randomly generated inputs.

The module is named `PbtTest`. The `use ExUnit.Case` line includes the necessary functions and macros from ExUnit to write tests, while `use PropCheck` does the same for PropCheck.

```elixir
  property "finds biggest element" do
    forall x <- non_empty(list(integer())) do #(1)
      biggest(x) == List.last(Enum.sort(x))
    end
  end
```

The `property` macro is used to define a property-based test. In this case, the test is named "finds biggest element". The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, `x` is a non-empty list of integers. For each generated list, the test asserts that the `biggest` function returns the same result as sorting the list and taking the last element (which should be the largest).

```elixir
  def biggest([head | tail]) do
    biggest(tail, head)
  end
```

The `biggest` function is defined with two clauses. The first clause matches when the input is a non-empty list. It starts the process of finding the biggest element by calling a helper function with the tail of the list and the head of the list as the initial maximum.

```elixir
  defp biggest([], max) do
    max
  end

  defp biggest([head | tail], max) when head >= max do #(2)
    biggest(tail, head)
  end

  defp biggest([head | tail], max) when head < max do
    biggest(tail, max)
  end
```

The helper function `biggest` is defined with three private (`defp`) clauses. The first clause matches when the list is empty, in which case it returns the maximum found so far. The other two clauses match when the list is non-empty. They compare the head of the list with the current maximum and call the helper function recursively with the tail of the list and the new maximum. The `when` keyword is used to specify a guard clause, which is a condition that must be met for the function clause to match.

This code is a good example of how to use property-based testing in Elixir. It also demonstrates the use of recursion and pattern matching to process lists, which are common techniques in functional programming.
