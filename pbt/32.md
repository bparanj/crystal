## Abstraction

An abstraction allows programmers to say more with less in their code. Justify this statement with two examples.

Abstraction in programming simplifies complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem, and working with instances of these classes. It allows programmers to handle complexity by hiding technical details and showing only the necessary features. Here are two examples to justify this statement:

1. **Function Abstraction**: 
   - Without Abstraction: Imagine writing a program where you need to sort data multiple times. Without abstraction, you'd have to write the sorting logic every time you need to sort data. This approach is repetitive and error-prone.
   - With Abstraction: By creating a function, say `sort()`, you encapsulate the sorting logic inside this function. Now, whenever you need to sort data, you simply call `sort()` without worrying about the underlying sorting mechanism. This function is an abstraction that hides the complexity of the sorting algorithm and allows you to say more (perform a sort operation) with less (a single function call).

2. **Object-Oriented Abstraction**:
   - Without Abstraction: Consider a program that manages vehicles. Without object-oriented abstraction, you would handle each type of vehicle (car, bike, truck) with separate code blocks, leading to redundant and hard-to-manage code.
   - With Abstraction: Using object-oriented principles, you can create a base class `Vehicle` with common attributes and methods. Specific vehicle types like `Car`, `Bike`, or `Truck` can inherit from `Vehicle` and have additional features unique to them. This approach lets you write less code (thanks to shared functionality in the `Vehicle` class) while still being able to represent a wide range of vehicles in your program. You can operate on the concept of a "vehicle" without needing to know the specifics of each type, unless necessary.

In both examples, abstraction allows you to reduce code complexity and increase readability and maintainability by focusing on the relevant details at a higher level, rather than getting bogged down in the intricacies of each implementation.
