Dialectical logic is a method of reasoning and argument that emphasizes the process of contradiction and its resolution. It originates from ancient philosophy but is most commonly associated with Marxist theory and Hegelian philosophy. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. **Thesis**: This is the initial statement or position. It represents an existing idea or argument.

2. **Antithesis**: This is the contradiction or opposition to the thesis. It challenges the initial position with a competing idea or argument.

3. **Synthesis**: This is the resolution of the contradiction between the thesis and antithesis. The synthesis takes elements from both to form a new proposition that reconciles the differences or transcends the initial conflict.

Dialectical logic views the process of thought and historical progress as a dynamic and contradictory process, where conflict and its resolution drive the development of ideas and societal change. Unlike classical logic, which may seek to establish static truths, dialectical logic focuses on the process of change, conflict, and contradiction as fundamental to understanding reality.

Hegel used dialectical logic to explain the process of philosophical development and history, where each stage of development necessarily leads to contradictions that are resolved at a higher level of understanding. Marx and Engels later adopted and adapted Hegel's dialectical method to analyze societal and economic conditions, focusing on the material conditions of life and the class struggle as the driving force of historical development.

Dialectical logic is critical in understanding complex processes of change, especially in social, economic, and philosophical contexts, providing a framework to analyze and understand the dynamics of contradictions and their resolutions.
