## ADT vs Type Class

The concepts of a type class and an Abstract Data Type (ADT) in Haskell represent two fundamentally different aspects of the language's type system and its approach to abstraction and polymorphism. Understanding the distinction between them is crucial for grasping Haskell's type-centric design philosophy.

### Abstract Data Type (ADT)

- **Definition**: An ADT in Haskell is a way to define new types by composing existing types. It encapsulates data and provides a concrete implementation. ADTs are used to model the data structures and are defined using the `data` keyword.
- **Purpose**: The primary goal of an ADT is to bundle data into more complex structures, potentially hiding implementation details (encapsulation) and providing a set of operations to manipulate the data safely.
- **Examples**: A list, a tree, or a custom type like `Maybe` or `Either` can be considered ADTs. For example, a binary tree might be defined as:
  ```haskell
  data BinaryTree a = Leaf a | Node (BinaryTree a) a (BinaryTree a)
  ```
- **Characteristics**: ADTs define the "shape" of the data, including the constructors that can be used to create instances of the type. They are about structuring and organizing data.

### Type Class

- **Definition**: A type class defines a set of functions that can operate on multiple types. Type classes specify behavior (interface) that types must implement, allowing for polymorphism. They are defined using the `class` keyword.
- **Purpose**: Type classes are used to define generic operations that can be applied to a wide range of types. Types become instances of a type class by implementing the specified functions, enabling a form of ad-hoc polymorphism.
- **Examples**: `Eq`, `Ord`, and `Show` are standard Haskell type classes. For instance, `Eq` provides an interface for equality testing:
  ```haskell
  class Eq a where
      (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
      (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  ```
- **Characteristics**: Type classes define behavior or operations that types must support, rather than the structure of the data itself. They allow functions to work abstractly with any type that implements the class's interface.

### Key Differences

- **What They Define**: ADTs define new data types by specifying their structure and components. Type classes define a set of operations (an interface) that types can implement.
- **Purpose and Use**: ADTs are about creating new types by combining existing ones, focusing on data structure. Type classes are about defining behavior that can be shared across different types, focusing on polymorphic function interfaces.
- **Polymorphism**: ADTs are used to achieve data abstraction and encapsulation, creating complex data types. Type classes enable ad-hoc polymorphism, allowing functions to operate on any type that implements the class's interface.

In summary, while ADTs are centered on structuring data, type classes are focused on defining and implementing behavior across different types. Both concepts are fundamental to Haskell's powerful and expressive type system, enabling high levels of abstraction, code reuse, and safety.
