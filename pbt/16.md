## Hundred Doors

In a Haskell project, it's good practice to organize your code by separating functions and their tests into different files. This makes your codebase more manageable and easier to navigate. For your `run` function and its QuickCheck test, you can follow this structure:

1. **Create a File for the Function**:
   - Create a new Haskell file for your function, e.g., `HundredDoors.hs`.
   - Define your `run` function in this file:
     ```haskell
     module HundredDoors where

     run :: Int -> [Int]
     run n = takeWhile (< n) [k*k | k <- [1..]]
     ```

2. **Create a File for Tests**:
   - Create a separate file for tests, e.g., `HundredDoorsTests.hs`.
   - In this test file, import both `Test.QuickCheck` and your `HundredDoors` module:
     ```haskell
     module HundredDoorsTests where

     import Test.QuickCheck
     import HundredDoors

     prop_run :: Int -> Property
     prop_run n = n > 0 ==> all (< n) xs && (null xs || maximum xs < n)
       where xs = run n

     main :: IO ()
     main = quickCheck prop_run
     ```

3. **Integrate with Your Build System**:
   - If you're using Cabal or Stack, make sure to update your `.cabal` or `package.yaml` file to include these new files in the right sections (library for `HundredDoors.hs` and test-suite for `HundredDoorsTests.hs`).

4. **Run the Tests**:
   - Use Cabal or Stack to run your tests:
     ```bash
     cabal test
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     stack test
     ```

This structure keeps your source code and tests organized. It's a common practice in Haskell and most other programming languages, aiding in maintainability and clarity.

Create the doors file inside the app directory. Create the test file inside the test directory. In cabal file, add:

```
test-suite hundred-doors-tests
  type: exitcode-stdio-1.0
  hs-source-dirs: test
  main-is: HundredDoorsTests.hs
  build-depends: base, QuickCheck   
  default-language: Haskell2010
```
