## LISP Popular Implementations

The most popular Lisp implementations vary depending on the specific dialect of Lisp being considered. For Common Lisp and Scheme, two of the most widely used dialects, the popular implementations are:

### Common Lisp

- **SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp)**: SBCL is one of the most popular and actively maintained implementations of Common Lisp. It is known for its performance, compliance with the ANSI Common Lisp standard, and powerful debugging tools. SBCL supports various platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows, making it a preferred choice for many Lisp developers.

- **Clozure CL (formerly OpenMCL)**: Clozure CL is another widely used Common Lisp implementation, appreciated for its performance and support for multithreading. It runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows, and like SBCL, it is known for being closely compliant with the ANSI Common Lisp standard.

### Scheme

- **Racket**: While Racket started as a Scheme implementation, it has evolved into a full-fledged programming language in its own right, extending Scheme with a powerful macro system and an extensive standard library. Racket is designed to be an educational language as well as a practical tool for building real-world applications. It comes with DrRacket, an IDE that is particularly friendly for beginners.

- **Guile**: Guile is the GNU Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions, designed to be embedded into applications to provide a high-level, Scheme-based scripting or extension language. Guile supports the writing of applications and scripts with a rich set of features and an emphasis on freedom and cooperation.

### Clojure

- **Clojure**: Though not a direct descendant of Common Lisp or Scheme, Clojure is a modern, functional Lisp dialect that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It has gained popularity for its concurrency support, immutable data structures, and interoperability with Java. Clojure's design emphasizes simplicity and robustness, making it a popular choice for modern software development, especially for web development and data analysis.

### Choosing a Lisp Implementation

The choice of a Lisp implementation often depends on the project requirements, such as performance needs, platform compatibility, and specific language features. SBCL is frequently recommended for those looking for a high-performance Common Lisp implementation, while Racket is praised for its educational resources and innovative language features. Clojure stands out for projects that can benefit from JVM interoperability and functional programming paradigms.

Each of these implementations has a strong community and ecosystem, making them viable choices for both beginners and experienced Lisp programmers.
