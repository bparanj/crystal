Extracting properties for Property-Based Testing (PBT) from a problem statement involves identifying invariant conditions that should always hold true, regardless of the input. These properties are derived from the specifications and expected behaviors of the function or system under test. The process usually includes the following steps:

### 1. Understand the Specification

- **Purpose**: Understand what the function or system is supposed to do. What are its inputs and outputs? What is its expected behavior?
- **Constraints**: Identify any constraints on the inputs or outputs. Are there limits on the sizes or types of inputs? Are there guarantees about the outputs?

### 2. Identify Invariants

- **Invariants**: These are conditions that remain true before and after the execution of the function, regardless of the specific inputs. For example, the sum of inputs equals the output in an addition function.
- **Postconditions**: What must be true about the outputs after the function has executed, given certain inputs?

### 3. Look for Edge Cases

- **Boundary Conditions**: Consider the limits of the inputs. What happens with very large, very small, or boundary values?
- **Special Cases**: Are there any inputs that should be treated differently? How should the function behave in those cases?

### 4. Define Properties

From the above considerations, define specific properties that can be tested:

- **Correctness**: The output correctly implements the specification for all possible inputs.
- **Idempotency**: Applying the function twice with the same inputs doesn’t change the output.
- **Commutativity**: For functions where order shouldn't matter, swapping inputs doesn’t change the output.
- **Inversibility**: For functions that have an inverse, applying the function and then its inverse should return to the original input.
- **Associativity**: For associative operations, grouping of operations doesn’t affect the result.
- **Range or Domain Constraints**: Outputs fall within a specific range or domain, given certain inputs.

### Example: Adding Two Numbers

Let's say we have a function `add(a, b)` that returns the sum of two numbers. From the problem statement, we can extract the following properties:

- **Correctness**: For any integers `a` and `b`, `add(a, b)` should equal `a + b`.
- **Commutativity**: `add(a, b)` should equal `add(b, a)`.
- **Identity Element**: Adding 0 should not change the number: `add(a, 0)` should equal `a`.
- **Associativity**: For any integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, `add(a, add(b, c))` should equal `add(add(a, b), c)`.

### Practice

Extracting properties becomes easier with practice. Start by identifying the core behavior expected from the function or system and then systematically consider how you can generalize that behavior into properties that can be tested for a wide range of inputs.
