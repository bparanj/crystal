In Lisp, `cdr` (pronounced "could-er") is a function that operates on lists. It returns the "rest" of the list, which is everything except the first element. The term `cdr` originates from the assembly language of the IBM 704 computer, where Lisp was first implemented, standing for "Contents of the Decrement part of Register."

When you apply `cdr` to a list, you get a list that contains all the elements except the first one. For example:

```lisp
(cdr '(a b c))  ; Returns '(b c)
```

Here are a few key points about `cdr`:

- If the list has only one element, applying `cdr` to it returns an empty list:
  ```lisp
  (cdr '(a))  ; Returns NIL or '()
  ```
- If applied to an empty list, `cdr` also returns an empty list:
  ```lisp
  (cdr '())  ; Returns NIL or '()
  ```
- `cdr` can be used in conjunction with `car` to navigate and manipulate lists. While `car` retrieves the first element, `cdr` gets the remainder of the list, making it possible to iterate over a list by recursively processing its head and tail.

Together, `car` and `cdr` form the foundation of list manipulation in Lisp, enabling a rich set of operations on list structures through their combination and repeated application.
