## η-reduction

η-reduction (eta-reduction) is a concept from lambda calculus, often used in functional programming languages like Haskell. It's a form of expression simplification. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **Lambda Calculus**: This is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application. It's the foundation of functional programming.

2. **η-Reduction Defined**: In lambda calculus, η-reduction is a rule used to simplify functions. The rule states that a function that takes an argument and simply applies another function to it can be simplified.

3. **The Rule**: If you have a function `f` defined as:
   ```haskell
   f = \x -> g x
   ```
   where `\x -> g x` means "a function that takes an argument `x` and applies `g` to `x`," η-reduction allows you to simplify `f` to just `g`. So, `f = g`.

4. **Example**:
   - Before η-reduction: `f x = add x 5` (a function `f` that adds 5 to `x`)
   - After η-reduction: `f = add 5` (a simpler representation of the same function)

5. **Why It's Used**:
   - **Simplification**: It makes functions simpler and more readable.
   - **Reduced Redundancy**: Avoids unnecessary wrapping of functions.
   - **Optimization**: In some cases, it can lead to more efficient code.

6. **In Practice**: In programming, especially in functional languages like Haskell, η-reduction is often applied by the compiler as an optimization technique. It can also be a useful principle for developers when writing or refactoring code to make it more concise and clear.

In summary, η-reduction is a rule from lambda calculus used in functional programming to simplify functions by removing unnecessary function wrappers, making the code more concise and potentially more efficient.
