## Reasons to Package Code

List three reasons one would package code in a procedure or function to solve a problem.

Packaging code in a procedure or function is a fundamental practice in software development, offering several advantages. Here are three key reasons for using this approach:

1. **Modularity**: Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts makes a program easier to understand, develop, and maintain. Functions and procedures encapsulate specific tasks or computations, allowing developers to focus on one aspect of the problem at a time. This modular approach facilitates debugging and testing, as each piece can be developed and tested independently before integrating into a larger system.

2. **Reusability**: Once a procedure or function is written to perform a specific task, it can be reused throughout the program whenever that task needs to be performed again. This reduces code duplication, which not only minimizes the chance for errors but also simplifies changes. If the logic of the task changes, only the function or procedure needs to be updated, and all parts of the program that use it automatically benefit from the change.

3. **Abstraction**: Functions and procedures provide a level of abstraction by hiding the implementation details of a task from the rest of the program. Callers of a function don't need to know how it accomplishes its task; they only need to know what inputs it requires and what output it produces. This abstraction barrier allows changes to be made to the implementation of a function without affecting the rest of the program, as long as its interface remains the same. This abstraction also supports the development of cleaner, more readable code by allowing developers to think and program at a higher level of logic rather than focusing on the nitty-gritty details of implementation.
