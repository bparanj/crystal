Solding mat and an ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) mat are different. Sometimes they have overlapping purposes.

## Soldering Mat

Designed to protect work surface from heat damage, solder splashes and other high-temperature materials. It is used when soldering electronic components.

They are made from heat-resistant materials like silicone. Silicone can withstand high temperatures without burning, melting or sticking.

They can have compartments to hold small components, screws or tools. It might be marked with grids for measurement or placement guides.

They may not offer ESD protection. They do not have a specified resistivity. Silicone is an isulator. They do not conduct electricity. Their resistivity is very high. 

## ESD Mat

Designed to dissipate static electricity. It prevents static discharge from damaging sensitive electronic components. It is used when working with electronic devices to avoid electrostatic discharge.

They are made from materials like conductive rubber or vinyl. These materials are designed to be conductive or dissipative to allow static electricity to safely discharge through a grounding point.

They are connected to a grounding wire to safely discharge static electricity. They are not heat-resistant. Hot soldering iron on an ESD mat can damage it.

They come in two types based on their resistive properties: conductive and dissipative.
