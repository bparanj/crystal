Is dimmer switch an example for potentiometer?

Yes, resistors are commonly used in AC circuits. They serve the following purposes:

1. **Limiting Current**: Resistors control the amount of current flowing through components in AC circuits, just as they do in DC circuits.

2. **Voltage Divider**: In combination with other components like capacitors or inductors, resistors create voltage dividers to manage and distribute AC voltage across different parts of the circuit.

3. **Impedance Matching**: Resistors help match impedance between different parts of an AC circuit, improving signal quality and power transfer, especially in audio and RF applications.

4. **Signal Attenuation**: Resistors reduce or attenuate AC signal strength in circuits where lower signal levels are required.

In AC circuits, resistors behave similarly to DC circuits by opposing current flow, but they donâ€™t affect phase as capacitors and inductors do.

## Dimmer Switch

A good real-world example is a **dimmer switch** for a light bulb.

1. **Current Control**: In a dimmer, a resistor is used to control the current flowing to the bulb. By adjusting the resistor, you control how much current passes through.

2. **Reduced Voltage**: As you increase the resistance, less current flows to the bulb, and the effective voltage reaching the bulb drops.

3. **Dimming Effect**: With reduced voltage and current, the bulb glows dimmer. Lower voltage means less power reaching the bulb, which dims the light.

The resistor limits current and simultaneously lowers the voltage that reaches the light, reducing its brightness. This is an example of how resistors control both current and voltage in practical applications.
