Differences and similarities between a resistor and a diode:

| Feature              | Resistor                                       | Diode                                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Function             | Limits or controls the flow of electrical current | Allows current to flow in one direction only       |
| Ohm’s Law            | Follows Ohm’s Law: \(V = IR\)                      | Does not follow Ohm’s Law; current-voltage relationship is nonlinear |
| Current Direction    | Allows current to flow equally in both directions | Allows current to flow in one direction (forward bias); blocks current in the opposite direction (reverse bias) |
| Voltage-Current Relationship | Linear (current is proportional to voltage) | Nonlinear (current increases exponentially with voltage in forward bias, and is almost zero in reverse bias until breakdown) |
| Applications         | Used for controlling current, dividing voltage, and reducing power dissipation | Used for rectification, voltage regulation, signal modulation, and protection circuits |
| Material             | Typically made of carbon, metal film, or wire-wound | Made of semiconductor materials (e.g., silicon, germanium) |
| Power Dissipation    | Resistors dissipate power as heat (Power = \(I^2R\)) | Diodes also dissipate power, mainly in forward bias (Power = \(V_f \times I\)) |
| Forward Voltage      | Not applicable                                     | Requires a forward voltage ( 0.7V for silicon, 0.3V for germanium) to conduct current |
| Reverse Bias         | Not applicable                                     | Blocks current until the breakdown voltage is reached (for Zener diodes, conducts in reverse above the Zener voltage) |
| Symbol Polarity      | No polarity; can be connected in either direction | Polarity sensitive; anode and cathode terminals must be connected correctly |
| Dependence on Temperature | Resistance can change with temperature but is generally stable | Diode characteristics (e.g., forward voltage) are highly temperature-dependent |
| Types                | Fixed, variable, thermistor, light-dependent resistor (LDR) | Standard diode, Zener diode, Schottky diode, LED, photodiode |
| Current-Voltage Characteristics Curve | A straight line (Ohmic behavior) | A curve showing exponential increase in forward bias and near-zero current in reverse bias (until breakdown) |

- What is bias in forward bias?

Bias in electronics refers to applying a voltage across a component to control its operation. In forward bias (specifically for diodes), it means applying a voltage that allows current to flow through the diode. 

For a diode:

- The positive voltage is applied to the Anode (the positive side of the diode).
- The negative voltage is applied to the Cathode (the negative side).

When a diode is forward-biased, it overcomes its built-in potential barrier (typically 0.7V for silicon diodes and 0.3V for germanium diodes). This allows current to flow freely across it, letting the diode conduct electricity in the forward direction.

Bias in forward bias refers to:

1. Definition:

- Applying voltage across a diode/LED
- Positive voltage to anode (P-side)
- Negative voltage to cathode (N-side)
- Makes current flow easily

2. Technical Explanation:

- Reduces barrier at PN junction
- Pushes electrons and holes toward junction
- Creates conduction path
- Allows current to flow

3. Circuit Conditions:

- Anode must be more positive than cathode
- Voltage must exceed forward voltage
- For LEDs: typically 1.8V-3.3V
- For regular diodes: typically 0.7V

4. Visual Indicator:

- In LED: Light emission occurs
- In diodes: Current flows freely
- Device conducts electricity

Think of it as setting up the correct polarity to make the device work as intended.

To plot linear and non-linear relationships involving a resistor and a diode, you can design simple experiments with varying voltage inputs and measure the resulting current. Here are two experiments:

### 1. Linear Relationship (Resistor: Ohm’s Law Experiment)

- Objective: Demonstrate a linear relationship between voltage and current across a resistor.
- Setup: Connect a resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ) in series with a variable DC power supply.
- Procedure:
  1. Vary the power supply voltage incrementally (e.g., 1V, 2V, 3V up to 10V).
  2. Measure the current through the resistor at each voltage.
  3. Plot Voltage (V) on the x-axis and Current (I) on the y-axis.
- Expected Result: A straight line, showing a linear relationship \( I = \frac{V}{R} \), where the slope represents the inverse of the resistor’s value.

### 2. Non-Linear Relationship (Diode: I-V Characteristic Experiment)

- Objective: Demonstrate a non-linear relationship between voltage and current across a diode.
- Setup: Connect a diode in series with a small resistor (e.g., 100Ω) and a variable DC power supply.
- Procedure:
  1. Gradually increase the voltage in small steps (e.g., 0.1V increments) up to around 1V, then in 0.2V increments up to 2V or 3V.
  2. Measure the current through the diode at each voltage step.
  3. Plot Voltage (V) on the x-axis and Current (I) on the y-axis.
- Expected Result: A non-linear, exponential curve. At low voltages, current remains nearly zero (cutoff region); once the threshold (around 0.7V for silicon) is crossed, current rises rapidly.

These experiments show:

- Resistor: A linear relationship following Ohm’s Law.
- Diode: A non-linear relationship due to its exponential response in the forward bias region.

- Shows perfect linear relationship (Ohm's Law)
- Includes simulated measurement noise for realism
- Plots I-V curve showing linear characteristics

2. For the Diode (Non-linear Relationship):

- Voltage range: -1V to +1V (typical for silicon diodes)

- Shows exponential relationship in forward bias
- Demonstrates near-zero current in reverse bias

3. Practical Experiment Setup:

- Lists required equipment
- Provides step-by-step instructions

- Specifies measurement ranges and steps

To conduct the actual experiments:
1. Use the power supply to apply voltage in steps
2. Measure both voltage across and current through each component
3. Record data points in a table
4. Plot the results using the provided code
