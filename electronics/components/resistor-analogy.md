PENDING DIAGRAM

Imagine a highway with multiple lanes (representing an electrical wire with minimal resistance) where traffic flows smoothly. When there’s a lane closure due to roadwork, cars must merge into fewer lanes, leading to slower traffic and increased congestion. This is similar to adding resistance in a circuit.

Electrons as Cars: In this analogy, cars are like electrons. Normally, they flow freely when resistance is low (all lanes are open).

Lane Closure (Adding Resistance): Closing lanes limits the number of cars (electrons) that can pass through at once. With fewer open lanes (higher resistance), the flow of traffic (current) decreases.

Voltage Drop: Just as cars take longer to get through due to congestion, the voltage “drops” across the resistor as it slows down the electron flow.

Closing lanes in traffic is like increasing resistance in a circuit: both restrict flow, leading to a traffic jam that reduces the current or the effective flow of cars/electrons moving forward.
