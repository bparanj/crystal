**Bias** in electronics refers to applying a voltage across a component to control its operation. In **forward bias** (specifically for diodes), it means applying a voltage that allows current to flow through the diode. 

For a diode:
- The **positive voltage** is applied to the **Anode** (the positive side of the diode).
- The **negative voltage** is applied to the **Cathode** (the negative side).

When a diode is forward-biased, it overcomes its **built-in potential barrier** (typically 0.7V for silicon diodes and 0.3V for germanium diodes). This allows current to flow freely across it, letting the diode conduct electricity in the forward direction.
