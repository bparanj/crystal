The current drawn from a battery depends on the load connected to it (the resistance or the power-consuming device) and Ohm's Law:

\[
I = \frac{V}{R}
\]

Where:
- \( I \) = Current (in Amps)
- \( V \) = Battery Voltage
- \( R \) = Load Resistance (in Ohms)

However, if you want to know the maximum current a battery can typically supply, here's a general guide for each type:

1. 1.5V (AA/AAA/C/D):
   - Capacity varies, around 2000-3000 mAh for AA.
   - Can supply currents up to 500 mA (AA) safely, with peak currents higher depending on type.

2. 3V (Coin cell CR2032):
   - Capacity is around 200-250 mAh.
   - Best for low current devices, typically 10-25 mA continuous.

3. 3.7V (Li-Ion/Li-Po):
   - Capacity ranges from 1000-3000 mAh.
   - Can deliver higher currents, often 1-3A safely.

4. 6V (Four AA in series):
   - Similar characteristics to AA, can provide 500-1000 mA, depending on battery type (alkaline or rechargeable).

5. 9V (Rectangular):
   - Capacity is low, around 500 mAh.
   - Provides moderate currents, typically 100-200 mA continuous.

6. 12V (Car Battery):
   - Very high capacity, up to 40-100 Ah (or more).
   - Can supply high currents, often 10-100A depending on the battery type.

For precise current draw, measure the resistance of the load or use the device specifications that will be connected to the battery.

You can find the maximum current a battery can supply in the following sources:

1. Battery Datasheet: The manufacturer provides a datasheet for each battery type, which includes key specifications like the maximum continuous current, peak current, and other important parameters.

2. Battery Packaging or Label: Sometimes, the current limits are mentioned on the battery's packaging or on the label, especially for rechargeable batteries.

3. Manufacturer's Website: Visit the battery manufacturer's website to access product specifications and datasheets for various battery models.

4. Battery Distributor Websites: Sites like Digi-Key, Mouser, Battery Junction, or Adafruit often have technical specs, including maximum current, for batteries they sell.

5. Technical Reviews or Guides: Some websites and forums publish detailed reviews and performance tests, particularly for popular batteries (like Li-Ion cells), which may indicate real-world current limits.

By consulting these sources, you can get accurate information about the battery's maximum current capabilities.
