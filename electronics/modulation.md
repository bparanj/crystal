Modulation** in electronics is the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal, with a separate signal that contains the information to be transmitted. This is essential in communication systems to efficiently transmit data over long distances.

There are several types of modulation:

1. Amplitude Modulation (AM): The amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the information signal.
2. Frequency Modulation (FM): The frequency of the carrier wave is varied according to the information signal.
3. Phase Modulation (PM): The phase of the carrier wave is varied in line with the information signal.

These techniques can be used for both analog and digital signals, allowing for the transmission of audio, video, and data.
