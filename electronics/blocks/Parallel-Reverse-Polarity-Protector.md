### **Parallel Reverse Polarity Protector Using Diodes**

A **Parallel Reverse Polarity Protector** is a simple circuit designed to protect a load from damage due to incorrectly connected power supply terminals. Unlike a series reverse polarity protector, this circuit places the diode in parallel with the load to shunt reverse current away, ensuring the load is not damaged.

---

### **Key Concepts**:

1. **Reverse Polarity Protection**:
   - When the power supply polarity is reversed, the diode becomes forward-biased and conducts, creating a short circuit to protect the load.

2. **Fuse for Protection**:
   - A fuse is typically included in the circuit to prevent overheating or damage to the power source or diode during reverse polarity.

3. **Applications**:
   - Battery-powered devices.
   - Power supplies and circuits requiring polarity protection.

### **Experiment Design for Tinkercad**:

#### **Objective**:
To design and simulate a **Parallel Reverse Polarity Protector** circuit and observe how it protects a load from damage when the power supply polarity is reversed.

---

#### **Components**:
1. **Diode** (1N4007 or similar).
2. **Fuse** (\( 1A \)).
3. **Resistor** (\( R = 1k\Omega \), simulating the load).
4. **DC Power Supply** (\( V_{supply} = 5V \)).
5. **Multimeters** (to measure current and voltage).
6. **Breadboard** and wires.

### **Circuit Connections**:

1. **Power Supply**:
   - Connect the positive terminal of the power supply to one terminal of the load resistor (\( R \)).

2. **Load Resistor**:
   - Connect the other terminal of the resistor to the ground of the power supply.

3. **Diode**:
   - Place the diode in parallel with the load:
     - Connect the cathode of the diode to the positive terminal of the power supply.
     - Connect the anode of the diode to the ground of the power supply.

4. **Fuse**:
   - Place the fuse in series with the power supply's positive terminal to protect against excessive current during reverse polarity.

5. **Multimeters**:
   - Place one multimeter across the load to measure voltage.
   - Place another multimeter in series with the power supply to measure current.

### **Steps to Perform**:

#### **1. Correct Polarity**:
1. Connect the power supply correctly (\( V_{supply} = +5V \) to the load's positive terminal).
2. Observe:
   - The load operates normally.
   - The diode is reverse-biased and does not conduct.
   - Voltage across the load is approximately \( 5V \).

#### **2. Reverse Polarity**:
1. Reverse the power supply terminals (\( V_{supply} = -5V \) to the load's positive terminal).
2. Observe:
   - The diode becomes forward-biased and conducts.
   - The voltage across the load drops to \( 0V \), protecting the load.
   - The fuse limits current, preventing overheating or damage to the diode.

#### **3. Restore Correct Polarity**:
1. Reconnect the power supply with correct polarity.
2. Observe:
   - The load resumes normal operation.
   - The diode is reverse-biased again.

### **Expected Results**:

1. **Correct Polarity**:
   - Voltage across the load is \( ~5V \).
   - The diode does not conduct.

2. **Reverse Polarity**:
   - The diode conducts, shunting current away from the load.
   - Voltage across the load is \( 0V \).
   - The fuse protects the diode from excessive current.

3. **Fuse Blowing (Optional Test)**:
   - If the reverse polarity is applied for an extended duration, the fuse may blow, cutting off the current to prevent damage.

---

### **Key Insights**:

1. **Protection Mechanism**:
   - The diode acts as a safeguard, conducting during reverse polarity and preventing current from reaching the load.

2. **Fuse Role**:
   - The fuse limits current through the diode to protect it from overheating.

3. **Applications**:
   - Essential in battery-powered devices where polarity mistakes can occur.

### **Tinkercad Simulation**:
In **Tinkercad**, you can simulate this circuit by:
1. Reversing the polarity of the power supply.
2. Observing the behavior of the diode, load, and fuse.
3. Verifying the current and voltage readings on the multimeters to confirm the circuit's operation.
