Electric energy can be converted to magnetic energy. Magnetic energy can be converted to electric energy.

This is the principle behind electromagnetism and is fundamental to many devices and systems.

Electric to Magnetic Energy: 

When electric current flows through a conductor, it creates a magnetic field around it. This is described by Ampere's Law, where electric current creates a magnetic field. This effect is the basis of electromagnets and devices like transformers. In an electromagnet, electric energy creates a magnetic field that can be used to attract ferromagnetic objects or interact with other magnets.

Magnetic to Electric Energy: 

When a magnetic field changes around a conductor, it induces an electric current in the conductor. This is governed by Faraday's Law of Induction, which states that a change in magnetic flux through a coil induces an electromotive force (EMF), generating electric current.

This phenomenon, known as electromagnetic induction, is the principle behind generators. In a generator, mechanical energy moves magnets near coils of wire, converting magnetic energy into electric energy.

This mutual conversion is widely used in motors, generators, transformers, and various electromagnetic applications. The efficiency of this conversion is fundamental to modern electrical engineering and power distribution systems.
