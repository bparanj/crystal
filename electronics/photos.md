Below are steps to address lighting and blurriness problems. Start with simple techniques and move towards more detailed approaches.

**1. Improve Lighting Conditions**  
   - **Basic Step: Increase Ambient Light**  
     Turn on overhead lights or position the setup near a window for natural light. More overall light reduces the camera’s need for long exposures, which can introduce blur.  
   - **Use a Desk Lamp or LED Light Panel**  
     Shine a small, consistent light source onto the component. Position it so the object is well lit but not washed out.  
   - **Add Diffusion**  
     If the light is harsh, place a white sheet of paper or a thin cloth between the lamp and the component. This softens shadows and evens out the lighting.  
   - **Light Tent or Softbox**  
     Consider a simple light tent (a small, white box-like enclosure) to surround the component. This ensures uniform, diffused light and reduces harsh shadows.

**2. Addressing Blurred Photos**  
   - **Stabilize the Camera**  
     Use a tripod or a stable surface to hold your camera steady. Any hand movement can cause blur in close-up shots.  
   - **Use a Faster Shutter Speed**  
     Switch to shutter priority mode (Tv) and choose a faster shutter speed to minimize motion blur. When lighting is improved, the camera can afford faster exposures.  
   - **Adjust Aperture for Depth of Field**  
     Use a smaller aperture (higher f-number) to increase depth of field. More of the object will be in focus, reducing the risk of parts appearing blurry.  
   - **Manual Focus**  
     Switch to manual focus and carefully adjust until the component is sharp. For static shots, manual focus often works better than autofocus.  
   - **Use Focus Peaking (If Available)**  
     Enable focus peaking in the camera’s settings. This feature highlights the areas in sharp focus, making it easier to fine-tune focus on small details.

**3. Combining Both Concepts**  
   - **Balance Lighting and Exposure**  
     With steady lighting, you can use a faster shutter speed and smaller aperture, reducing blur. Proper lighting also lets you keep ISO low, which keeps the image clear.  
   - **Refine Setup**  
     Position the component so that you have enough room for your camera and lights. Adjust the angle and distance to get the best combination of sharpness and even lighting.

**Key Takeaways**  
- Good lighting allows faster shutter speeds and smaller apertures, both of which reduce blur.  
- Stabilizing the camera and using manual focus are critical for capturing sharp details in close-up shots.  
- Combining proper lighting and stable camera settings leads to clear, detailed photos of small components.
