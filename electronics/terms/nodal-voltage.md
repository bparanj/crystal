Nodal voltage in electronics refers to the electric potential (voltage) at a specific node (point) in a circuit relative to a common reference point, usually ground. It’s a key concept in nodal analysis, a method for determining the voltage at various points in a circuit to analyze current flow and overall circuit behavior.

### Key Points about Nodal Voltage:

1. Node Definition:

A node is a point in a circuit where two or more components connect, like where resistors, capacitors, or voltage sources meet.
   
2. Reference Node (Ground):

Typically, one node is chosen as the reference node (ground), which is considered to have zero voltage. All other node voltages are measured relative to this point.
   
3. Using Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL):

Nodal analysis applies KCL to calculate nodal voltages. KCL states that the sum of currents entering and leaving a node must be zero. By setting up equations based on KCL for each node, you can solve for unknown voltages.

4. Purpose:

Knowing the nodal voltages allows you to determine currents through various components using Ohm’s Law, providing insight into the circuit's functionality.

### Example:

For a simple circuit with resistors and a voltage source:

- Label each node and select one as the reference (ground).
- Write equations based on KCL for each node, incorporating the resistances and source voltages.
- Solve these equations to find the nodal voltages.

Nodal voltage analysis is essential for complex circuits as it provides a systematic way to understand voltage distribution and current flow.

In TinkerCAD Circuit simulator, to measure nodal voltages using a multimeter, follow these steps:

1. Set up the multimeter:

   - Drag a multimeter onto your workspace
   - Set it to measure voltage (V)
   - Make sure it's set to DC voltage for DC circuits or AC for AC circuits

2. Measuring technique:

   - Black lead (COM) connects to ground/reference node (usually 0V)
   - Red lead (V) connects to the node you want to measure
   - The reading shows voltage relative to ground

3. Steps in TinkerCAD:

   - Click on the multimeter to place it
   - Click on the leads to create connection points
   - Connect black lead to ground
   - Connect red lead to your node of interest
   - Start simulation to see readings

Notes:

- You can use multiple multimeters simultaneously
- Voltage is always measured relative to a reference point
- Make sure your circuit is properly grounded
- TinkerCAD multimeters are ideal (don't affect circuit operation)
