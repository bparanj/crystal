Forward Bias (Conducting State):

When a diode is forward-biased (positive voltage applied to the anode relative to the cathode), current flows easily from the anode to the cathode.

Reverse Bias (Non-Conducting State)

When a diode is reverse-biased (positive voltage applied to the cathode relative to the anode), it prevents current from flowing, except in special cases like Zener diodes where reverse breakdown occurs.
