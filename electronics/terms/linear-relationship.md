A **linear relationship** means that two quantities change at a constant rate relative to each other. In a graph, this relationship appears as a straight line. It can be expressed with the equation:

\[
y = mx + b
\]

Where:
- \( y \) and \( x \) are the two variables.
- \( m \) is the slope (rate of change).
- \( b \) is the y-intercept (starting value when \( x = 0 \)).

In simple terms, a linear relationship means that as one variable increases or decreases, the other does so in a steady, predictable way.
