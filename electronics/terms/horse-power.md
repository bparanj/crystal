The term **horsepower (hp)** comes from the historical comparison of the power output of engines to the work done by horses, which were commonly used for tasks like pulling carts or plowing fields before the advent of engines.

### Origin:
1. **Coined by James Watt**: In the late 18th century, James Watt, a Scottish engineer and inventor, introduced the term to market his steam engines. He wanted to give people a relatable way to understand the capability of his engines compared to the common "engine" of the timeâ€”horses.
   
2. **Measurement Basis**:
   - Watt observed that an average horse could turn a mill wheel with a certain amount of force and speed.
   - He calculated that a horse could do **33,000 foot-pounds of work per minute**, which became the standard definition of one horsepower.

3. **Why "Horse"?**
   - Horses were widely used as a measure of work capability in agriculture and transportation.
   - Comparing his steam engines to horses allowed Watt to show that his invention could replace multiple horses, making it a practical and appealing investment.

### Fun Fact:
Although horses inspired the term, actual horsepower differs slightly:
   - A **horse** can produce **about 15 horsepower** during short bursts of effort.
   - One horsepower is a standardized unit, not the literal power output of a single horse. 

This historical context gave rise to the lasting use of "horse" in "horsepower."
