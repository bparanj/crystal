The farad (F) and the coulomb (C) measure different but related properties in electrical systems.

- Coulomb (C) is a unit of electric charge. It measures the amount of electric charge present, where 1 coulomb equals the charge carried by approximately \(6.24 \times 10^{18}\) electrons.

- Farad (F) is a unit of capacitance. It measures the capacity of a system to store electric charge per unit voltage.

### Why We Need Farads

Capacitance is about how much electric charge a component (like a capacitor) can hold at a given voltage. The relationship between charge (\(Q\)), capacitance (\(C\)), and voltage (\(V\)) is given by:

\[
Q = C \cdot V
\]

In this equation:
- Q is measured in coulombs,
- C is measured in farads,
- V is measured in volts.

This equation shows that capacitance is a property that tells us how many coulombs of charge can be stored per volt of electric potential difference. The farad expresses this storage ability, which depends not only on the amount of charge but also on the voltage.

### Example:

If a capacitor has a capacitance of 1 farad, it means that for every 1 volt applied, the capacitor can store 1 coulomb of charge. If the capacitance were higher, the same voltage would store more charge, and vice versa.

Coulomb describes the quantity of charge.
Farad describes the capacity to store charge relative to the voltage, a distinct property crucial in designing circuits for energy storage, filtering, and timing applications.

Farads are used in calculating how components behave in circuits, especially where energy storage or discharge timing is involved, which goes beyond just knowing the charge amount.
