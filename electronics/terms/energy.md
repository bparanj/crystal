Here are the different types of energy:

1. **Kinetic Energy** - Energy of motion.
2. **Potential Energy** - Stored energy due to position.
3. **Thermal Energy** - Energy from heat.
4. **Chemical Energy** - Energy stored in chemical bonds.
5. **Electrical Energy** - Energy from electric charges.
6. **Nuclear Energy** - Energy stored in atomic nuclei.
7. **Radiant Energy** - Energy from electromagnetic waves (light).
8. **Mechanical Energy** - Sum of kinetic and potential energy in a system.
9. **Sound Energy** - Energy carried by sound waves.

Each type of energy can be converted from one form to another.

The unit of energy for all these types is the **Joule (J)**.

All types of energy use the Joule as a unit because energy, regardless of its form, is a measure of the ability to perform work. The Joule is defined as the amount of work done when a force of one newton displaces an object by one meter in the direction of the force. This standardization allows for consistent measurement and comparison of different energy forms.

## Thermal vs Heat Energy

Thermal energy and heat energy are related concepts but are not the same.

### Thermal Energy

- **Definition**: Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of particles in a substance due to their random motion. Itâ€™s an internal property of the material and depends on the temperature and mass of the substance.
- **Context**: All objects with a temperature above absolute zero contain thermal energy, as their particles are in constant motion.

### Heat Energy

- **Definition**: Heat energy, or simply heat, is the transfer of thermal energy between objects of different temperatures. It flows from the warmer object to the cooler one until thermal equilibrium is reached.
- **Context**: Heat is not a property contained in an object but rather an energy flow due to a temperature difference.

### Difference

- **Thermal energy** is the energy within an object due to particle motion, while **heat energy** is the transfer of that energy from one object to another. 

So, while thermal energy is stored within a substance, heat is the movement of thermal energy between substances.
