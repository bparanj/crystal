A directly proportional relationship means that as one quantity increases, the other increases at the same rate. If you double one quantity, the other also doubles. This relationship can be expressed with the formula:

\[
y = kx
\]

Where:

- \( y \) and \( x \) are the two quantities.
- \( k \) is a constant that shows the rate of proportionality.

In simpler terms, if two values are directly proportional, they change together consistently.

In a graph, a directly proportional relationship looks like a straight line passing through the origin (0, 0). This means the line starts at the origin and increases or decreases with a constant slope. The equation for a directly proportional relationship is:

\[
y = kx
\]

Where:

- \( y \) is the dependent variable.
- \( x \) is the independent variable.
- \( k \) is a constant.

Key characteristics:

- Straight Line: The relationship is linear.
- Passes Through the Origin: The line always starts at (0, 0), indicating when one quantity is 0, the other is also 0.
- Constant Slope: The slope (rate of change) remains the same, showing a steady increase or decrease between the variables.
