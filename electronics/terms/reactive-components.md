Capacitors and inductors are called reactive components because they store and release energy rather than dissipating it, as resistors do. This energy storage causes them to react to changes in voltage and current over time, which creates a phase difference between voltage and current in AC circuits.

### Characteristics of Reactive Components

1. Energy Storage:
   - Capacitors store energy in an electric field created by the separation of charges across their plates.
   - Inductors store energy in a magnetic field created by the current flowing through their coils.
   - Unlike resistors, which convert energy into heat, capacitors and inductors temporarily store energy and then release it back into the circuit.

2. Phase Shift:
   - In capacitors, the current leads the voltage by 90 degrees (current reaches its peak before the voltage does).
   - In inductors, the voltage leads the current by 90 degrees (voltage reaches its peak before the current does).
   - This phase shift is a defining characteristic of reactive components in AC circuits.

3. Reactance:
   - Reactance is the opposition to AC current due to capacitors and inductors. It varies with frequency:
      - Capacitive reactance decreases as frequency increases (making it easier for AC to pass through).
      - Inductive reactance increases as frequency increases (making it harder for AC to pass through).
   - This frequency-dependent behavior is why these components are useful in filters, oscillators, and tuning circuits.

4. Reactive Power:
   - Capacitors and inductors produce reactive power, which is the power that oscillates back and forth between the component and the source without being converted to useful work.
   - Reactive power does not consume energy but instead causes temporary storage and return of energy, which influences the overall power flow in AC circuits.

Capacitors and inductors are called reactive components because they store energy temporarily, causing a phase difference between voltage and current, and produce reactance, which affects AC current flow. This reactive behavior is essential for controlling the behavior of AC circuits.
