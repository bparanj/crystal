No, this is not correct. In an alternating current (AC) system, both the polarity of the voltage and the direction of the current periodically reverse. The electrons in the wire oscillate back and forth, changing direction many times per second,  at a frequency of 50 or 60 Hz, depending on the country.

The power supply company generates AC voltage, which causes the current to alternate in direction. This means that the electrons in the wire move forward and backward, but they don't ly travel from the power company to your house. Instead, the energy is transmitted through the wire by the oscillating motion of the electrons.

This is different from direct current (DC), where the polarity of the voltage and the direction of the current remain constant, and the electrons flow steadily in one direction from the source to the load.

No, this is not correct. In alternating current (AC), both the polarity of the voltage and the direction of the current flow change periodically. The electricity flows back and forth between the power supply company and the house.

In an alternating current (AC) system, even though the direction of the current flow reverses periodically, the direction of energy flow remains consistently from the power supply company to the home. This is due to the way power is transferred in AC systems, where energy is delivered to the load (your home) during each cycle, regardless of the current's instantaneous direction. The energy transfer can be understood through the concept of instantaneous power, which, despite the oscillating current, results in a net flow of energy in the direction of the load over time.

The work of energy transmission in an AC system is done by the electromagnetic field. Here’s a detailed explanation:

In an AC power system, energy is transmitted from the power supply to the load (such as a home) through the creation and propagation of electromagnetic fields around the conductors. These fields oscillate with the alternating current, but the overall effect is a net transfer of energy in one direction—from the power plant to the end user.

### How It Works:

1. Electromagnetic Fields:

The alternating voltage and current in the conductors create alternating electric and magnetic fields. These fields propagate outward from the conductors and carry energy along the transmission lines.

2. Poynting Vector:

The Poynting vector (\(\mathbf{S}\)), defined as \(\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}\), represents the directional energy flux (the rate of energy transfer per unit area) of an electromagnetic field. Here, \(\mathbf{E}\) is the electric field, and \(\mathbf{H}\) is the magnetic field. The Poynting vector points in the direction of energy flow.

3. Energy Transmission:

Despite the current reversing direction, the Poynting vector consistently points from the source to the load, indicating that the net energy flow is always towards the home. This is because the product of voltage and current (power) is still positive on average, meaning that energy is being delivered to the load over time.

Net Energy Transfer:

The oscillating nature of AC current and voltage means that the instantaneous power can be positive or negative. However, over a complete cycle, the energy delivered to the load is positive, resulting in a net transfer of energy from the power supply to the home.

While the current direction changes periodically, the electromagnetic fields generated by this current ensure that energy consistently flows from the power supply to the home.
