The concept that connects electricity and magnetism is known as electromagnetism. This principle explains how electric fields and magnetic fields are interrelated and can influence each other. Key concepts in electromagnetism include:

### 1. Electromagnetic Fields:

When an electric current flows through a conductor, it generates a magnetic field around it. This is the foundation of electromagnetism, showing that electricity can produce magnetism.

Conversely, a changing magnetic field can induce an electric current in a conductor. This phenomenon is known as electromagnetic induction.

### 2. Electromagnetic Induction:

Discovered by Michael Faraday, electromagnetic induction is the principle behind transformers, generators, and inductors. Faraday’s Law states that a changing magnetic field within a coil of wire induces an electric current.

This principle is used in power generation, where mechanical energy (like a spinning turbine) creates a changing magnetic field, which then induces electrical current.

### 3. Maxwell's Equations:

James Clerk Maxwell developed a set of equations that mathematically describe the relationship between electric and magnetic fields. Maxwell’s Equations unified electricity and magnetism, showing them as different aspects of the same force—the electromagnetic force.

### Applications:

Electromagnetism is fundamental to various technologies, including:

- Electric motors: Use electric current to create a magnetic field, producing rotational motion.
- Transformers: Use electromagnetic induction to transfer electrical energy between circuits.
- Wireless communication: Uses electromagnetic waves (radio, microwaves) to transmit information.

Electricity and magnetism are deeply connected by the principles of electromagnetism, where electric currents generate magnetic fields, and changing magnetic fields induce electric currents. This connection is essential to many modern technologies and forms the basis of our understanding of electromagnetic waves, including light.
