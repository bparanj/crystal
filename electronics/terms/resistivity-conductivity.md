## Resistivity vs Conductivity

PENDING

What does it mean to be a reciprocal?

Is resistivity the opposite of conductivity?

Yes, resistivity is effectively the inverse of conductivity, but they are not precisely "opposites"; they are reciprocals.

1. Conductivity (\(\sigma\)) measures a material's ability to conduct electric current. It indicates how easily electrons can flow through the material. Higher conductivity means lower resistance to current.

2. Resistivity (\(\rho\)) measures a material's resistance to electric current. It indicates how much the material opposes the flow of electrons. Higher resistivity means more opposition to current.

They are mathematically related:

\[
\sigma = \frac{1}{\rho} \quad \text{and} \quad \rho = \frac{1}{\sigma}
\]

A high resistivity material (like rubber) has low conductivity, and a high conductivity material (like copper) has low resistivity. So, while they aren't opposites, they are inversely related.

Yes, resistivity and conductivity are mathematical reciprocals of each other, meaning:

Conductivity = 1/Resistivity

- Resistivity (ρ) measures how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current (measured in ohm-meters, Ω⋅m)
- Conductivity (σ) measures how easily a material allows electric current to flow (measured in siemens per meter, S/m)

For example:

- A material with high resistivity (like rubber) has low conductivity
- A material with low resistivity (like copper) has high conductivity

Think of it like a water pipe:

- High resistivity is like a narrow pipe that restricts water flow
- High conductivity is like a wide pipe that allows water to flow easily

While they measure opposite properties, they're simply different ways of expressing the same electrical characteristic of a material.
