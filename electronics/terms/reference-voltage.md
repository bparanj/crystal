voltage

A reference voltage is a stable and precise voltage used as a benchmark for comparing or measuring other voltages in a circuit. It's like a ruler for electricity. It is useful in applications where accuracy and stability of voltage are necessary.

Voltage Regulators: 

A reference voltage is used to maintain a stable output voltage in voltage regulator circuits, which is important for powering sensitive electronics.

3. Generating Reference Voltage:

Zener Diodes: 

Often used to create a stable reference voltage in simple circuits. A Zener diode, when reverse-biased, maintains a constant voltage across it equal to its Zener breakdown voltage.
