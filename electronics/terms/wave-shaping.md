No, there isnâ€™t a single word that universally encompasses both **clipper** and **clamper** circuits, as they serve distinct functions:

- **Clippers** limit or "clip" the amplitude of a signal, effectively removing parts of the waveform beyond a certain voltage threshold.
- **Clampers** shift the voltage level of a signal without altering its shape.

These circuits fall under the broader category of **wave-shaping circuits** or **signal conditioning circuits**, but neither term specifically identifies both functions simultaneously.
