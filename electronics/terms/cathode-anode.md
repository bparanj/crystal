Review and revise (manual edit):

The terms 'cathode' and 'anode' originate from Greek words 'kathodos' (downward path) and 'anodos' (upward path), respectively. Michael Faraday introduced these terms in the 1830s during his work on electrolysis. He conceived the cathode as where current exits (down) and the anode as where current enters (up) the device.

Despite our current understanding that electrons flow in the opposite direction, these terms are still used. The cathode is the electrode where reduction occurs (electrons enter), while the anode is where oxidation occurs (electrons leave). In a diode, the cathode is marked by a line, and the anode is represented by a triangle pointing towards the cathode.

The names cathode and anode originate from electrochemistry and were adopted in electronics to describe the terminals of devices like diodes. The cathode is where electrons enter the diode, and the anode is where they leave, corresponding to the direction of current flow when the diode is conducting.
