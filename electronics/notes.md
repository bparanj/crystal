Current limiting with a transistor

RC Network

Experiment to demonstrate capacitor as a timing component in an electronic circuit

A capacitor can be used:

 to block DC current while it passes pulses, or electrical “noise,” or alternating
current, or audio signals, or other wave forms. This capability enables it to smooth the output voltage provided by power supplies 

to remove spikes from signals that would otherwise tend to cause spurious triggering of components in digital circuits 

to adjust the frequency response of an audio circuit; or to couple separate components or circuit elements that must be protected from transmission of DC current.

When a resistor is placed across the leads of a charged capacitor, the capacitor will discharge 

itself through the resistor at a rate limited by the resistance. Conversely, if a capacitor is charged
through a resistor, the resistor will limit the charging rate.

A resistor in series with a capacitor is known as an RC network (Resistor-Capacitor network). An RC circuit is shown with a SPDT switch that charges or discharges the capacitor via a series resistor. The voltage at point A increases nonlinearly (relative to the negative side of the power supply) while the capacitor is charging, and decreases nonlinearly while the capacitor is discharging, as suggested by the graphs. At
any moment, the time that the capacitor takes to acquire 63% of the difference between its current charge and the voltage being supplied to it is known as the time constant for the circuit.
