What happens when capacitor is connected in parallel?

When capacitors are connected in parallel, their total or equivalent capacitance increases. This setup impacts the circuit’s behavior in several important ways:

### 1. Increased Total Capacitance

   - When capacitors are connected in parallel, their capacitances add up. The total capacitance \( C_{\text{total}} \) is given by:
     \[
     C_{\text{total}} = C_1 + C_2 + \dots + C_n
     \]
   - This means that the total capacitance is the sum of each capacitor’s individual capacitance. As a result, the circuit can store more charge overall.

### 2. Voltage Across Each Capacitor Remains the Same

   - In a parallel connection, each capacitor experiences the same voltage as the power supply. This is because each capacitor is directly connected across the supply terminals.
   - This is useful in applications where multiple capacitors are added to smooth voltage fluctuations or supply steady current without changing the voltage.

### 3. Increased Energy Storage Capacity

   - Because capacitance increases in parallel, the circuit can store more energy, which is helpful in applications requiring a steady current over time or in power supplies that need stable voltage even under load.
   - The total energy stored in capacitors in parallel is greater, following the formula:
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{2} C_{\text{total}} V^2
     \]
     where \( V \) is the voltage across the capacitors.

### Implications

   - Higher Capacitance for Energy Storage: Parallel capacitors are commonly used in power supply circuits to provide a large, stable current capacity, as this increases the total charge storage.
   - Stabilized Voltage Across Components: Since all capacitors share the same voltage, parallel capacitors help stabilize voltage across sensitive components.

In summary, connecting capacitors in parallel increases the total capacitance, allowing for more charge storage at a given voltage, which is ideal for applications needing stable power and high energy storage capacity.

You can use Tinkercad to demonstrate the effect of connecting capacitors in parallel by observing how the total capacitance changes and how it affects the charging and discharging behavior. In this experiment, we’ll measure the charge and discharge time of capacitors connected in parallel compared to a single capacitor.

### Components:

1. DC Power Supply: 9V DC source.
2. Capacitors: Two capacitors with equal values, such as 10 µF each.
3. Resistor: 1 kΩ resistor (to control the charging and discharging rate).
4. Switch: To control the charging and discharging of the capacitors.
5. Multimeter: To measure the voltage across the capacitors.
6. Oscilloscope: (Optional) To observe voltage changes over time.

### Circuit Setup:

1. Single Capacitor Setup (Reference Measurement):
   - Connect one terminal of the DC power source to one end of the resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to the positive terminal of a single 10 µF capacitor.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the capacitor to the ground terminal of the power supply.
   - Place a switch in series with the capacitor to control charging and discharging.
   - Attach the multimeter across the capacitor to measure voltage.

2. Parallel Capacitor Setup:
   - Now, modify the circuit to include two capacitors in parallel:
     - Connect the positive terminal of the second capacitor to the positive terminal of the first capacitor.
     - Connect the negative terminal of the second capacitor to the negative terminal of the first capacitor (both capacitor negative terminals go to ground).
   - Keep the switch in the same position as before.
   - Attach the multimeter across both capacitors to measure the combined voltage.

### Experiment Steps:

1. Step 1: Charge a Single Capacitor:
   - Begin with the single capacitor setup.
   - Close the switch to allow the capacitor to charge.
   - Observe the voltage across the capacitor using the multimeter or oscilloscope.
   - Expected Outcome: The capacitor will charge up to the supply voltage (9V). Record the time taken for the capacitor to charge to approximately 63% of the full voltage (which corresponds to one time constant, \( \tau = RC \)).

2. Step 2: Charge Capacitors in Parallel:
   - Replace the single capacitor with the parallel capacitor setup (two capacitors in parallel).
   - Close the switch to allow the capacitors to charge.
   - Observe the voltage across the capacitors using the multimeter or oscilloscope.
   - Expected Outcome: The voltage across the parallel capacitors will also reach 9V, but the charging time will be longer compared to the single capacitor setup. This is because the total capacitance has increased, so the circuit can store more charge, making the charging process slower.

3. Step 3: Compare Discharge Times:
   - Open the switch to allow the capacitors to discharge through the resistor.
   - Observe the time it takes for the voltage across the capacitors to drop back down, and compare it to the time taken for the single capacitor to discharge.
   - Expected Outcome: The parallel capacitors will discharge more slowly than the single capacitor due to the increased total capacitance.

### Explanation:

- Total Capacitance in Parallel: When capacitors are connected in parallel, their total capacitance is the sum of individual capacitances:
  \[
  C_{\text{total}} = C_1 + C_2
  \]
  For two 10 µF capacitors in parallel, the total capacitance becomes 20 µF, allowing the circuit to store more charge.
- Charging and Discharging Times: The increased capacitance in the parallel setup increases the time constant \( \tau = RC \), which leads to a longer charging and discharging time compared to a single capacitor.

### Observing the Results

This experiment allows you to visualize the impact of connecting capacitors in parallel, demonstrating how total capacitance increases, which leads to a slower charge/discharge rate and a higher charge storage capacity. This is useful in applications that need stable, long-lasting power, such as power supplies and energy storage systems.
