In TRIZ, the **Object-Tool-Function** model helps identify and define the relationships within a system. Each part of the model represents:

1. **Object**: The element being affected.
2. **Tool**: The element causing the effect.
3. **Function**: The interaction or effect between the tool and the object.

### Resistor in Electronics as Object-Tool-Function

For a resistor in an electronic circuit, let’s apply this model:

- **Tool**: The resistor acts as the tool, as it influences the current in the circuit.

- **Object**: The current or voltage that flows through the circuit becomes the “object” influenced by the resistor.

- **Function**: The resistor limits or regulates the current flow, preventing other components (e.g., LEDs, transistors) from damage. This regulation is the resistor's function in the circuit.

### Example Breakdown:

- **Tool (Resistor)**: Adjusts the flow of electrons.
- **Object (Current/Voltage)**: Receives the limiting effect of the resistor.
- **Function (Regulation)**: Controls the amount of current, ensuring it stays within safe levels.

By applying this model, we see the resistor’s role more clearly: it’s not merely a component but a “tool” used to fulfill a critical function (regulation) to achieve stability and safety within an electronic circuit. This perspective helps analyze and optimize designs by examining how well each component’s function aligns with system needs.

## Work Done vs Function

In TRIZ, the term **function** refers broadly to any intended action or purpose a component performs within a system. This isn’t exactly the same as "work done by using energy," though it’s related.

- **Function in TRIZ**: It describes what a component (tool) achieves with respect to another component (object) in the system. The function might not always involve energy use in a physical sense but can still define a purposeful interaction, such as organizing, supporting, protecting, or even stopping something. Functions can be both physical (e.g., generating heat, emitting light) or non-physical (e.g., organizing information, restricting movement).

- **Work Done by Using Energy**: This typically refers to physical energy expenditure in classical physics, where work occurs when a force moves an object over a distance. While many TRIZ functions involve energy (like powering a motor to move), not all functions in TRIZ require physical energy or movement. For example, in TRIZ, a function might involve an aesthetic or organizational role that doesn’t fit into the traditional concept of work.

So, while TRIZ functions often involve energy transfer or work, the TRIZ concept of function is broader, encompassing any purposeful action or effect a component has within the system.
