Pragmatic Electronics

Foundations through Experimentation

The basic principles from physics is explained in a simple language to provider a deeper understanding of the electronics. The basics of innovation is also discussed in the context of electronics.

Don't damaage any components and waste. Big companies are already wasting lot of electronics. Simulation is the answer.

Revise the experiments

Experiments Sequence

1. Short Circuit
		Demonstrate what happens to the voltage between the power source when there is a short circuit.
2. LED damage
		Demonstrate what happens to an electronic component when the current is not controlled.
3. LED Circuit (Resistor + LED)
		Demonstrate how controlling the current through an electronic component can protect it from damage.
    
Add voltage divider etc to this list. Refer voltage-divider-circuit.md

4. Push Button
		Demonstrate the use of pushbutton to control the flow of current through a circuit.
5. Slide Switch
		Demonstrate the use of slide switch to control the flow of current through a circuit.
6. Potentiometer
		Demonstrate the use of variable resistor to control the flow of current through a circuit.
7. Capacitor
		Demonstrate the basic function of a capacitor in a circuit.
8. Polarized Capacitor (see components/polarized-capacitor)
- Take screenshots of the Polarized Capacitor Demo Circuit

See polarized-capacitor-experiment.md

Run the polarized capacitor experiment in Tinkercad https://www.tinkercad.com/things/blx1Lukof5N/editel

Design an experiment to demonstrate capacitor charging and discharging using an LED indicator. Modified the existing slideswitch demo and add a capacitor to the circuit.

See the capacitor-experiments.md

8. Missing Capacitor Experiment
		Demonstrate what happens to an electronic circuit when capacitor is not used.
9. Diode
		Demonstrate the basic function of a diode in a circuit.
10. Transistor
		Demonstrate the use of transistor in a circuit.

Create Simulation

Refer the links. Run simulation. Take screenshots of every step in the simulation

11. Inductor (Demo: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/jw2rfdSUsWg-inductordemonstration)
12. Variable Capacitor (LC Tuning Circuit) (LC - Inductor-Capacitor) https://www.tinkercad.com/things/bNBojeH8c6s-frequency-generator
		This should go after experiment #8.
