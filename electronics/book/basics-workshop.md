jumper wire connections
Breadboard are used to prototype and experiment with electronic circuits.

The areas A and D are power rails. They are used to connect the postive and negative terminals of a battery to provider power source to the circuit. This is the top and bottom sections of the breadboard. The horizontal rows are connected together.

The terminal strips are used to connect the electronic components to form a circuit. The vertical columns are connected together. The gap between area B and area C are not connected.


The Arduino Nano module is used as a power source. We can use it as a 5V power source by connecting it to a USB-C cable and connecting the other end to a laptop. Once connected, a red LED will be glow.
