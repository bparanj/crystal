Missing Capacitor Experiment

Demonstrate what happens to an electronic circuit when capacitor is not used.

Tinkercad Simulation is pending. Is this possible to simulate using Tinkercad? If not, show the real experiment.

## Missing Capacitor Experiment

A simple experiment to demonstrate the problem caused by not using a **capacitor** involves using an **LED** with a **switch** connected to a DC power supply. This setup shows how **capacitors help stabilize voltage** and prevent flickering or noise in circuits.

### Materials:
- **LED**
- **Resistor** (e.g., 220Ω to protect the LED)
- **Switch** (push button or slide switch)
- **Power supply** (e.g., 5V battery or DC source)
- **Capacitor** (e.g., 100 µF electrolytic capacitor)
- Connecting wires

### Steps:

1. **Build the Circuit Without a Capacitor**:
   - Connect the LED in series with the resistor and switch to the power supply.
   - The circuit should be: **Power supply -> Resistor -> LED -> Switch -> Power supply**.

2. **Operate the Switch**:
   - Toggle the switch on and off quickly. Observe the LED as you repeatedly switch the power.

3. **Observe Flickering**:
   - Without a capacitor, the LED may flicker or blink slightly as you toggle the switch. This happens because there is no smoothing component to stabilize the voltage fluctuations.

4. **Add a Capacitor and Repeat**:
   - Connect the capacitor in parallel with the LED and resistor (positive side to positive supply, negative side to ground).
   - Toggle the switch on and off as before, but now observe how the LED behaves with the capacitor in place.

5. **Observe the Stabilizing Effect**:
   - With the capacitor, the LED will remain stable, and any flickering or noise will be reduced. The capacitor smooths out the fluctuations by temporarily storing and releasing energy as needed.

### Explanation:
Without a capacitor, quick voltage changes can cause flickering, especially in circuits with sensitive components. Adding a capacitor acts as a **voltage stabilizer**, storing charge to maintain a steady output, which prevents flickering and ensures smooth operation. This experiment demonstrates the capacitor's role in **smoothing out voltage fluctuations** in circuits.
