Experiment #1:

A **capacitor** is an electronic component that can become a **short-circuit** when it fails.

In a normal state, a capacitor blocks DC current after charging and allows AC to pass, acting as an insulator for direct current. However, when a capacitor fails, particularly through **dielectric breakdown**, it can lose its insulating property and create a low-resistance path between its terminals. This failure effectively **short-circuits** the capacitor, allowing current to flow freely where it should be blocked, potentially damaging other components in the circuit.

Other components, such as **transistors** and **diodes**, can also fail as a short-circuit in certain conditions, but capacitors are commonly known for this type of failure mode.

A **resistor** commonly becomes an **open-circuit** when it fails.

In normal operation, a resistor provides a specific resistance to limit current flow. However, due to factors like excessive heat or mechanical stress, the resistor can break or **burn out**, creating an open circuit. When this happens, it stops conducting entirely, and current can no longer flow through it.

Other components, such as **fuses**, **inductors**, and certain **semiconductors** (e.g., transistors), can also fail as open circuits under specific conditions. However, resistors are frequently associated with open-circuit failures in electronics.
