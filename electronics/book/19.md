Steps

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 3

Take a 100 k ohm resistor and connect it to d8 and f8 in the breadboard. Anode of the Zener diode is connected to one end of the resistor.

Step 4

Connect the resistor to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. This is the black wire from a8 to the negative terminal.

Step 5

Connect the ? of the Zener diode to the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Step 6

Take a function generator and change its setting to 1000 Hz frequency, 5 volts and sine wave function.

Step 7

Connect the negative terminal of the function generator to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Step 8

Connect the positive terminal of the function generator to the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Step 9

Take an oscilloscope and change the setting to 0.3 m seconds.

Image 12

Step 10

Connect the negative terminal of the oscilloscope to the negative terminal of the function generator.

Image 13

Step 11

Connect the positive terminal of the oscilloscope to the positive terminal of the function generator.

Step 12

Run the simulation. We can see the input to the circuit in the oscilloscope.

Image 15

Step 13

Take another oscilloscope for viewing the output of the circuit. Change the setting to 0.2 m seconds.

Image 16

Step 14

Connect the negative terminal of the output oscilloscope to the negative side of the resistor. This is the connection to c8 in the breadboard.

Image 17

Step 15

Connect the postive terminal of the output oscilloscope to the g8 in the breadboard. Now we can view the output across this resistor in the oscilloscope.

Step 16

Run the simulation. You can see the positive side of the input is clipped. This is a negative clipper. The reason it is clipping the positive side is due to polarity of the Zener diode.

Step 17

Change the Zener diode direction.

Step 18

Run the simulation. You can now see the negative side of the input has been clipped in the output.
