Step 16

Run the simulation. You can see the positive side of the input is clipped. This is a negative clipper. The reason it is clipping the positive side is due to polarity of the Zener diode.

In this experiment, the Zener diode is used as a negative clipper, where it restricts the positive half of the AC waveform. Here’s a breakdown of the relevant steps and observations focused specifically on the Zener diode’s role as a negative clipper:

PENDING

Review and condense:

   - The 5.1V Zener diode is placed with its cathode connected to the positive terminal of the function generator (through the power rail).
   - The anode of the Zener diode is connected to a 100 kΩ resistor, which is then connected to the ground (negative terminal of the power rail).

   - A sine wave with a frequency of 1000 Hz and a peak-to-peak amplitude of 10V (5V in each direction) is generated by the function generator.
   - This sine wave oscillates between +5V and -5V.

   - When the sine wave goes positive and exceeds the Zener breakdown voltage (5.1V), the Zener diode begins to conduct in reverse bias.
   - This action limits the positive voltage across the output to the Zener breakdown voltage, approximately +5.1V.
   - The oscilloscope shows that the positive side of the waveform is clipped, flattening the peaks above +5.1V while the negative side remains unaffected.

In this configuration, the Zener diode’s reverse-biased breakdown property limits the voltage across it. When the input voltage goes above the Zener voltage (5.1V in this case), the diode conducts, preventing the output voltage from rising further. This behavior clips the positive peaks of the AC signal, resulting in a waveform that oscillates from approximately 0V to +5.1V.

This experiment demonstrates the negative clipping effect of a Zener diode, where the diode limits or "clips" the positive side of the input waveform to its breakdown voltage. This effect occurs due to the orientation of the Zener diode, where it is reverse-biased relative to the positive input cycle.

Demonstrate Zener diode voltage regulation:

a) Set up a circuit with a variable power supply, a 470Ω resistor, and a 5.1V Zener diode.
b) Connect a voltmeter across the Zener diode.
c) Increase the supply voltage from 0V to 12V.
d) Observe the voltage across the Zener diode:
   - Below 5.1V, it follows the supply voltage.
   - Above 5.1V, it remains constant at approximately 5.1V due to the controlled breakdown effect.
