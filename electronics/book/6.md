Potentiometer

Demonstrate the use of variable resistor to control the flow of current through a circuit.

Components

1. Coin cell 3 volt battery
2. Red LED
3. Resistor with 51 ohm value
4. Potentiometer with 500 ohm value

Step 1

Take a breadboard. We will place it vertical position to make it easy to understand the connections between the components.

Step 2

Take a coin cell 3 volt battery.

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard. This is the black color connection.

Step 4

Connect a red LED to the breadboard.

Step 5

Connect the Anode of the LED to the positive terminal of the breadboard. This is the red color connection.

Step 6

Connect the Cathode of the LED to the section C of the breadboard. This is the green color connection.

Step 7

Connect the Cathode terminal of the LED to one end of the resistor.

Step 8

Connect the potentiometer to the breadboard as shown in the diagram. This makes the first terminal of the potentiometer connect to the resistor.

Step 9

Connect the middle terminal of the potentiometer to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 10

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard. This completes the circuit by creating a closed circuit.

Step 11

Run the simulation. The red LED turns on.

Step 12

Turn the potentiometer. You can see the pointer has moved to the right. The brightness of the LED is reduced because the total resistance increases due to the potentiometer.

Step 13

Increase the dial of the potentiometer. Observe the brightness of the LED.

Step 14

Move the potetiometer dial position to its original position. You can see the brightness of the LED is maximum. This is because the potentiometer resistance is lowest at this setting.

The closeup image shows the connections between the components.

Step 15

A white LED is used to make the brightness easy to see.

Step 16

Potentiometer setting at its highest, reduces the brightness of the LED.

Step 17

A blue LED is used to make the brightness changes easier to observe.

### Key Takeaways

1. A potentiometer acts as a variable resistor. It controls the flow of current through a circuit and adjust the LED brightness.

2. A fixed 51 Î© resistor is added to ensure a minimum current limit, protecting the LED even if the potentiometer is set to its lowest resistance.

3. Turning the potentiometer changes its resistance, affecting the current and altering the LED brightness:
   - **Low Resistance**: More current, LED is brighter.
   - **High Resistance**: Less current, LED is dimmer.

4. Potentiometers provide a way to fine-tune current flow without changing circuit components, offering flexibility for experimenting with different brightness levels.

5. The circuit visually demonstrates how adjusting resistance impacts current flow and LED behavior, making it a practical example of current control in electronics.
