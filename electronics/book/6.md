Step 1

Take a breadboard. We will place it vertical position to make it easy to understand the connections between the components.

Step 2

Take a coin cell 3 volt battery.

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard. This is the black color connection.

Step 4

Connect a red LED to the breadboard. The longer leg connects to e4 and the shorter leg connects to e5.

Step 5

Connect the Anode of the LED to the positive terminal of the breadboard. This is the red color connection postive power rails of the breadboard to a4.

Step 6

Connect the Cathode of the LED to the section C of the breadboard. This is the green color connection e5 to f5.

Step 7

Connect the Cathode terminal of the LED to one end of the resistor. The resistor is on g5 and g9.

- Why do you need a resistor when a potentiometer is used here?

Step 8

Connect the potentiometer to the breadboard as shown in the diagram (j9-j10-j11). This makes the first terminal of the potentiometer connect to the resistor. The breadboard makes the connection between j9 to g9 from underneath. No wires are required for this connection.

Step 9

Connect the middle terminal of the potentiometer to the negative terminal of the breadboard. The negative terminal of the breadboard connects to f10.

Step 10

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard. This completes the circuit by creating a closed circuit.

Step 11

Run the simulation. The red LED turns on.

Step 12

Turn the potentiometer. You can see the pointer has moved to the right. The brightness of the LED is reduced because the total resistance increases due to the potentiometer.

Step 13

Increase the dial of the potentiometer. Observe the brightness of the LED.

Step 14

Move the potetiometer dial position to its original position. You can see the brightness of the LED is maximum. 

Image 14

This is because the potentiometer resistance is lowest at this setting.

The closeup image shows the connections between the components.

Step 15

A white LED is used to make the brightness easy to see.

Step 16

Potentiometer setting at its highest, reduces the brightness of the LED.

Step 17

A blue LED is used to make the brightness changes easier to observe.

This experiment demonstrates the use of a **variable resistor (potentiometer)** to control the flow of current in a circuit, affecting the brightness of an LED.


The potentiometer adjusts the total resistance in the circuit, controlling the current flowing through the LED. By turning the dial, the resistance can be increased or decreased, which directly affects the LED's brightness.

When the potentiometer’s resistance is low, more current flows through the LED, resulting in higher brightness. As the potentiometer’s resistance is increased, the current decreases, causing the LED to dim.

A fixed resistor (51Ω) is used alongside the potentiometer to ensure a minimum level of resistance, protecting the LED from excessive current when the potentiometer is at its lowest setting.

The potentiometer allows for **real-time control** of current flow, demonstrating the concept of a variable resistor in managing current within an electronic circuit.

This experiment highlights how a potentiometer can be used to control current and, consequently, the brightness of an LED. It demonstrates the principle of variable resistance and the importance of a fixed resistor to prevent excessive current, offering flexible current management in circuits.

PENDING

Realworld example of dimmer switch goes here. Find the notes.

A potentiometer acts as a variable resistor. It controls the flow of current through a circuit and adjust the LED brightness.

A fixed 51 Ω resistor is added to ensure a minimum current limit, protecting the LED even if the potentiometer is set to its lowest resistance.

Turning the potentiometer changes its resistance, affecting the current and altering the LED brightness:
   - Low Resistance: More current, LED is brighter.
   - High Resistance: Less current, LED is dimmer.

Potentiometers provide a way to fine-tune current flow without changing circuit components, offering flexibility for experimenting with different brightness levels.

The circuit visually demonstrates how adjusting resistance impacts current flow and LED behavior, making it a practical example of current control in electronics.
