Potentiometer

Demonstrate the use of variable resistor to control the flow of current through a circuit.

In this circuit, the resistor is used in addition to the potentiometer to provide a minimum level of current limiting and to protect the LED.

The potentiometer can vary its resistance from 0 to 500 ohms. At or near 0 ohms, there would be very little resistance if no other resistor were present. Without the additional 51-ohm resistor, setting the potentiometer to a low resistance could allow too much current to flow through the LED, potentially exceeding its maximum safe current and causing it to burn out.

The fixed 51-ohm resistor provides a baseline resistance in the circuit, ensuring that even at the potentiometer's lowest setting, the circuit still has some resistance This fixed resistor protects the LED and other components by keeping the current within a safe range, regardless of how low the potentiometer is set.

A fixed resistor (51Ω) is used alongside the potentiometer to ensure a minimum level of resistance, protecting the LED from excessive current when the potentiometer is at its lowest setting.

The resistor also helps prevent the battery from being overloaded by limiting the maximum current that can flow through the circuit, which could otherwise quickly drain a small coin cell battery.

- Limit the minimum current to a safe level,
- Protect the LED from high current when the potentiometer is set to low resistance,
- Ensure stable operation of the circuit and prevent damage to components.

This combination of a fixed resistor and a potentiometer provides both safety and control, allowing for smooth adjustment of the LED brightness without risking damage to the LED or the power source.

A potentiometer acts as a variable resistor. It controls the flow of current through a circuit.
A fixed 51 Ω resistor is added to ensure a minimum current limit, protecting the LED even if the potentiometer is set to its lowest resistance.

Turning the potentiometer changes its resistance, affecting the current and altering the LED brightness:

Low Resistance: More current, LED is brighter.
High Resistance: Less current, LED is dimmer.

Potentiometers provide a way to fine-tune current flow without changing circuit components, offering flexibility for experimenting with different brightness levels.

Step 11

Run the simulation. The red LED turns on.

Step 12

Turn the potentiometer. You can see the pointer has moved to the right. The brightness of the LED is reduced because the total resistance increases due to the potentiometer.

Step 13

Increase the dial of the potentiometer. Observe the brightness of the LED.

Step 14

Move the potetiometer dial position to its original position. You can see the brightness of the LED is maximum.

This is because the potentiometer resistance is lowest at this setting.

This experiment demonstrates the use of a variable resistor (potentiometer) to control the flow of current in a circuit, affecting the brightness of an LED.

The potentiometer adjusts the total resistance in the circuit, controlling the current flowing through the LED. By turning the dial, the resistance can be increased or decreased, which directly affects the LED's brightness.

When the potentiometer’s resistance is low, more current flows through the LED, resulting in higher brightness. As the potentiometer’s resistance is increased, the current decreases, causing the LED to dim.

This experiment highlights how a potentiometer can be used to control current and the brightness of an LED. It demonstrates variable resistance and the importance of a fixed resistor to prevent excessive current.
