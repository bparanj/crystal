This experiment is a variation of the existing LED experiment. Merge content with this experiment.

A diode is a device that conducts current in one direction. When forward-biased (anode positive relative to cathode), current flows through the circuit. When reverse-biased, current flow becomes negligible.

Reverse the direction of LED and you will not see it turn on. This shows the current can flow in only one direction in a diode.


A diode only allows current to flow in one direction—from the Anode to the Cathode. Reversing the diode's orientation blocks current, demonstrating its role as a one-way valve for electrical flow.

In the forward direction, the diode allows current to pass, lighting up the LED. In the reverse direction, it blocks the current, and the LED stays off.

Diodes can protect circuits by preventing reverse polarity connections, which could otherwise damage sensitive components.

The LED’s behavior visually confirms the function of the diode, as it only lights up when the current flows correctly through the circuit.

5. Resistor Usage: 

A 1 kΩ resistor limits the current, ensuring both the LED and diode operate safely without excessive current draw.

e) Observe the LED lighting up, indicating forward current flow.
f) Reverse the LED's connections to the battery.
g) Observe the LED remaining off, demonstrating reverse-bias blocking.
