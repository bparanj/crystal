Diode

Demonstrate the basic function of a diode in a circuit.

Components

1. 9 volt battery
2. Diode
3. Resistor with 1 k ohm value
4. Red LED

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery.

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect a diode to the section B of the breadboard.

Step 5

Connect the Anode terminal of the diode to the 1 k ohm resistor.

Step 6

Connect the red LED to the section C of the breadboard.

Step 7

Connect the Cathode terminal of the red LED to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 8

Connect the positive terminal of the breadboard to the Cathode of the diode.

Step 9

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the postive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 10

Run the simulation. The red LED turns on.

PENDING

Reverse the direction of the diode and show that the red LED will be off. This demonstrate how the diode only allows current to flow in one direction.
