Diode

Demonstrate the basic function of a diode in a circuit.

Components

1. 9 volt battery
2. Diode
3. Resistor with 1 k ohm value
4. Red LED

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery.

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect a diode to the section B of the breadboard.

Step 5

Connect the Anode terminal of the diode to the 1 k ohm resistor.

Step 6

Connect the red LED to the section C of the breadboard.

Step 7

Connect the Cathode terminal of the red LED to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 8

Connect the positive terminal of the breadboard to the Cathode of the diode.

Step 9

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the postive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 10

Run the simulation. The red LED turns on.

PENDING DEMO

Reverse the direction of the diode and show that the red LED will be off. This demonstrates how the diode only allows current to flow in one direction.

### Key Takeaways

1. Diode Directionality: 

A diode only allows current to flow in one direction—from the Anode to the Cathode. Reversing the diode's orientation blocks current, demonstrating its role as a one-way valve for electrical flow.

2. Current Control: 

In the forward direction, the diode allows current to pass, lighting up the LED. In the reverse direction, it blocks the current, and the LED stays off.

3. Circuit Protection: 

Diodes can protect circuits by preventing reverse polarity connections, which could otherwise damage sensitive components.

4. LED Behavior: 

The LED’s behavior visually confirms the function of the diode, as it only lights up when the current flows correctly through the circuit.

5. Resistor Usage: 

A 1 kΩ resistor limits the current, ensuring both the LED and diode operate safely without excessive current draw.
