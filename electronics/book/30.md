RC Delay Timer

see rc-delay-timer folder for images

To introduce a delay using an RC (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit in Tinkercad, you can set up a simple LED circuit where the LED lights up after a delay, controlled by the charging time of the capacitor.

### Objective:

To demonstrate a basic delay using an RC circuit.

### Components:

- 1 Power Source (e.g., 9V battery)
- 1 Resistor (e.g., 10 kΩ)
- 1 Capacitor (e.g., 500 μF)
- 1 NPN Transistor (e.g., 2N2222)
- 1 LED
- 1 Resistor for LED (e.g., 220 Ω)

### Steps:

   - Connect the positive terminal of the 9V battery to the positive rail of the breadboard.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the 9V battery to the ground rail.

   - Connect one end of the 10 kΩ resistor to the positive rail.
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to one leg of the 100 μF capacitor.
   - Connect the other leg of the capacitor to the ground rail. 

   - Connect the base of the NPN transistor to the point where the resistor and capacitor meet.
   - Connect the emitter of the transistor to the ground rail.
   - Connect the collector of the transistor to one leg of the LED.

   - Connect the other leg of the LED to a 220 Ω resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the 220 Ω resistor to the positive rail.

   - When you connect the battery, the capacitor will start charging through the 10 kΩ resistor.
   - As the capacitor charges, the voltage at the transistor’s base gradually increases.
   - Once the voltage reaches a certain threshold, the transistor turns on, allowing current to flow through the LED and lighting it up.
   - The time delay before the LED lights up is determined by the RC time constant, which is the product of the resistor and capacitor values ( \( \tau = R \times C \) ).

Change the value of the capacitor from 500 micro F to 4000 micro F to demonstrate the increase in time delay.
