Steps

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take a ? ohm resistor. Connect it to e4 and g4 in the breadboard.

Step 3

Connect a 9 volt battery to the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect the resistor to the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. This is the red line from j4 to the positive terminal.

Step 5

Take a multimeter. Change the setting to measure current.

Step 6

Connect the positive terminal of the multimeter to the end of the resistor.

Step 7

Connect the negative terminal of the multimeter to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. This connects the multimeter in series with the resistor. Now we can measure current through the circuit.

Step 8

Run the simulation. You will see the reading is 8.99 m Amps of current flowing through the circuit.

Step 9

Remove the multimeter connection. Let's add a ? F capacitor in series with the resistor. Capacitor is connected to b4 and b5 in the breadboard.

Step 10

Connect the positive terminal of the multimeter to the other end of the capacitor. This is the red line connecting to a5 in the breadboard.

Step 11

Connect the negative terminal of the multimeter to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. Now the multimeter is in series with the resistor and the capacitor. We can now measure the current flowing after the capacitor.

Step 12

Run the simulator. You will see the current through the circuit after the capacitor is 0.
