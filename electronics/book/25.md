Step 7

Connect the negative terminal of the multimeter to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. This connects the multimeter in series with the resistor. Now we can measure current through the circuit.

Step 8

Run the simulation. You will see the reading is 8.99 m Amps of current flowing through the circuit.

Step 9

Remove the multimeter connection. Let's add a 100 nano F capacitor in series with the resistor. Capacitor is connected to b4 and b5 in the breadboard.

Step 10

Connect the positive terminal of the multimeter to the other end of the capacitor. This is the red line connecting to a5 in the breadboard.

Step 11

Connect the negative terminal of the multimeter to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. Now the multimeter is in series with the resistor and the capacitor. We can now measure the current flowing after the capacitor.

Summarize:

This experiment demonstrates properties of DC circuits and capacitors in series, showing how capacitors block DC current while allowing initial transient currents during charging.

1. Ohmâ€™s Law and Current Measurement:
   - Initially, with just the resistor in the circuit, the current through the resistor is measured using a multimeter.
   - The current value is determined by Ohm's Law: \( I = \frac{V}{R} \), where \( V = 9 \, \text{V} \) and \( R \) is the resistor value.

2. Capacitors Block DC Current:
   - When a capacitor is added in series with the resistor, the steady-state current through the circuit drops to 0 mA because a fully charged capacitor blocks the flow of DC current.
   - This demonstrates that capacitors do not allow a continuous flow of DC current; they only allow current to flow temporarily while charging.

3. Series Circuit Behavior:
   - The experiment highlights the difference in current flow with and without a capacitor in a series circuit.
   - In the presence of a capacitor, the circuit becomes open once the capacitor is fully charged.

4. Transient Current (Not explicitly shown):
   - If the capacitor were initially uncharged, a brief current would flow as the capacitor charges. However, once fully charged, the current would drop to zero.

Capacitors in DC Circuits: 

Used to block DC current while allowing AC signals in mixed circuits.

Energy Storage: 

Capacitors temporarily store charge, which can be used in pulsed or transient applications.

Circuit Behavior Analysis: 

Demonstrates the importance of understanding how components behave differently in DC and AC circuits.
