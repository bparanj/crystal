LED Circuit (Resistor + LED)

Demonstrate how controlling the current through an electronic component can protect it from damage.

Components

1. Resistor with 1 k ohm value
2. Red LED
3. 4 batteries (AA size)

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take 4, 1.5 volt batteries. This will give a power source with 1.5 * 4 = 6 volts.

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect the postive terminal in the power rails of the breadboard to section B of the breadboard. We keep an open circuit when we lay the components for safety.

Step 5

Connect the resistor such that the section B of the breadboard connected to positive terminal connects to one end of the resistor.

Step 6

Connect the other end of the resistor to the section C of the breadboard by using a connecting wire. This is the green line in the diagram. We need this connection because the section B and C of the breadboard are not connected.

Step 7

Connect the red LED to the breadboard.

Step 8

Connect the smaller leg of the LED to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 9

Connect the positive terminal of the breadboard to the positive terminal of the battery. Now the entire circuit is complete.

Step 10

Run the simulation. The RED led is in the on state.

For contrast, a white LED is used to show the on and off state. The off state is seen as gray color and the on state is seen as white as the LED glows.

A blue LED is also used to make the on and off state easy to see.
