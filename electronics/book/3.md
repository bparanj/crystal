LED Circuit (Resistor + LED)

Demonstrate how controlling the current through an electronic component can protect it from damage.

Components

1. Resistor with 1 k ohm value
2. Red LED
3. 4 batteries (AA size)

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take 4, 1.5 volt batteries. This will give a power source with 1.5 * 4 = 6 volts.

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect the postive terminal in the power rails of the breadboard to section B of the breadboard. We keep an open circuit when we lay the components for safety.

Step 5

Connect the resistor such that the section B of the breadboard connected to positive terminal connects to one end of the resistor.

Step 6

Connect the other end of the resistor to the section C of the breadboard by using a connecting wire. This is the green line in the diagram. We need this connection because the section B and C of the breadboard are not connected.

Step 7

Connect the red LED to the breadboard.

Step 8

Connect the smaller leg of the LED to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 9

Connect the positive terminal of the breadboard to the positive terminal of the battery. Now the entire circuit is complete.

Step 10

Run the simulation. The RED led is in the on state.

For contrast, a white LED is used to show the on and off state. The off state is seen as gray color and the on state is seen as white as the LED glows.

A blue LED is also used to make the on and off state easy to see.

### Key Takeaways

1. Current Limiting Resistor: 

Using a resistor (1 kΩ) limits the current through the LED, protecting it from damage due to excessive current.
   
2. Controlled Power Supply: 

The circuit uses four AA batteries (6V total), demonstrating how to control voltage and current for safe LED operation.

3. LED Polarity Matters: 

Proper orientation of LED connections is crucial—the longer leg (Anode) to positive, the shorter leg (Cathode) to negative.

4. Circuit Integrity: 

Completing the circuit step-by-step ensures safety by avoiding accidental short circuits.

5. Visual Feedback: 

LEDs provide clear visual feedback of circuit status—lit LED confirms correct connections, while off state signals potential issues.

By controlling current, the LED is protected and operates reliably, illustrating the importance of precise circuit design.

Key Takeaways:

1. Current Control:
- Resistor limits current flow through LED
- Prevents LED damage by keeping current below maximum rating
- Demonstrates Ohm's Law in practical application

2. Component Protection:
- Without resistor (previous experiment): LED burns out at 915mA
- With 1kΩ resistor: Current is limited to safe level
- Shows importance of current regulation in electronic circuits

3. Circuit Design Principle:
- LED requires current management for proper operation
- Power source (6V) is safely converted to usable energy
- Demonstrates basic protection in electronic circuit design

4. Electrical Safety:
- Current limiting components are essential
- Proper component selection prevents device failure
- Shows relationship between voltage, current, and resistance

The experiment demonstrates how a resistor protects electronic components by controlling current flow, which is a fundamental principle in electronic circuit design.
