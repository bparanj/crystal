Provide a short description for finding the datasheet and reading the relevant sections to find the values needed for the experiment.

LED Circuit (Resistor + LED)

Demonstrate how controlling the current through an electronic component can protect it from damage.

We will begin with the same circuit used for the LED damage demo and modify it. The circuit diagram is shown in the diagram.

Components

1. Resistor with 1 k Ohm value
2. Red LED
3. 9 volt battery

Image 1

The circuit uses one 9 volt battery, demonstrating how to control voltage and current for safe LED operation.

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery. This will give a power source with 9 volts.

Image 4

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Image 5

Step 4

Connect the negative terminal of the power rails of the breadboard to section B of the breadboard.

Image 6

We keep an open circuit when we lay the components for safety.

Step 5

Connect the LED to the section B of the breadboard. The Cathode of the LED is connected to the negative terminal.

Step 6

Connect the Anode of the LED to the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Step 7

Connect the the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard. Now the entire circuit is complete. This is the same circuit as the previous experiment.

Step 8

We can now modify the previous experiment. Instead of connecting the LED directly to the negative terminal, we will use the resistor. Remove the direct connection from LED to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 9

Connect one end of the resistor to the Cathode of the LED, connect the other end to the section C of the breadboard.

Step 10

Connect the resistor to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 11

Run the simulation. The RED led is in the on state.

Step 12

If we reverse the direction of LED by connecting Anode of the LED to the resistor and Cathode of the LED to the positive terminal of the power supply, the LED will not turn on. This demonstrates that LED which is a type of diode only allows current to flow through in one direction. The polarity matters.

Revise and condense:

Using a resistor (1 kÎ©) limits the current through the LED, protecting it from damage due to excessive current. The LED used in this experiment can only handle current upto 20 mA. You can see the maximum rating for the LED in the datasheet.

LEDs have polarity. They only allow current to flow in one direction. Reversing the LED's connections by connecting the anode to the resistor and cathode to the positive terminal will not turn on the LED. Correct polarity is required for proper functioning of the LED. The longer leg (Anode) is connected to positive, the shorter leg (Cathode) to negative.

LEDs provide visual feedback of flow of current through the circuit. LED confirms correct connections by turing on and not getting damaged like the previous experiment when the current was 915 mA.
