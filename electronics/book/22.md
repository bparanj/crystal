Step 13

Take another oscilloscope to view the output of the circuit.

Step 14

Connect the negative terminal of the output oscilloscope to the cathode of the diode. This is the black line from the oscilloscope to the c8 in the breadboard.

Step 15

Connect the positive terminal of the output oscilloscope to the anode of the diode. This is the red line from the oscilloscope to the g8 in the breadboard.

Step 16

Run the simulation. You can see the input waveform and the output waveform. The output has chopped the positive sides of the input wave form. This is the positive clipper circuit.

In this experiment, we have a positive clipping circuit using a diode and a resistor to clip the positive part of an AC waveform.

- The diode is oriented with its anode connected to the resistor and its cathode connected to the negative rail (ground).
- When the input sine wave goes positive (above 0V), the diode becomes forward-biased if the input voltage exceeds the diode's forward voltage (typically around 0.7V for a silicon diode).
- As a result, the positive part of the input waveform above 0.7V is "clipped" or removed, because the diode conducts and directs this excess voltage to ground, preventing it from reaching the output.

- When observing the output on the oscilloscope, you’ll see that the positive portion of the sine wave above approximately 0.7V is removed, or clipped, resulting in a flat line at 0.7V during these peaks.
- The negative portion of the sine wave, however, is unaffected because the diode is reverse-biased during this half-cycle and does not conduct.

- When you run the simulation, you’ll observe the input waveform on one oscilloscope as a full sine wave.
- On the output oscilloscope, you’ll see a clipped sine wave with the positive peaks limited to around 0.7V or less, depending on the diode's characteristics.

This circuit is a positive clipper because it clips or removes the positive portion of the input signal above a specific threshold (the diode's forward voltage), demonstrating the basic function of diode-based clipping in signal processing.
