Step 4

Take a diode. Connect the diode to f8 and d8 in the breadboard.

Image 4

Anode of the diode is connected to the resistor.

Step 6

Connect the resistor to the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. This is the red wire from j4 to the positive terminal.

Step 7

Connect the negative terminal of the function generator to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Step 10

Connect the negative terminal of the oscilloscope to the negative terminal of the function generator.

Image 12

Step 11

Connect the positive terminal of the oscilloscope to the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Step 12

Run the simulation. The input wave form is a sine wave with frequency 1 kHz and 5 volts. So far, we have verified the input. Stop the simulation.

Step 13

Take another oscilloscope to view the output of the circuit.

Image 15

Step 14

Connect the negative terminal of the output oscilloscope to the ? of the diode. This is the black line from the oscilloscope to the c8 in the breadboard.

Image 16

Step 15

Connect the positive terminal of the output oscilloscope to the ? of the diode. This is the red line from the oscilloscope to the g8 in the breadboard.

Step 16

Run the simulation. You can see the input waveform and the output waveform. The output has chopped the positive sides of the input wave form. This is the positive clipper circuit.
