Threshold Voltage

When the LED turns on in this circuit, it demonstrates forward voltage. Forward voltage is the voltage required for the LED to conduct current and emit light. When the LED is forward-biased and the voltage across it reaches a certain threshold (the forward voltage), it allows current to flow and the LED lights up. So, the LED turning on is an example of forward voltage at work.
