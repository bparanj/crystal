## Relay

An electromagnetic armature relay is a type of relay that uses an electromagnet to mechanically operate a switch. When an electric current flows through the relay's coil, it creates a magnetic field that attracts a movable armature. This movement either opens or closes electrical contacts, allowing or interrupting the flow of current in a circuit.

These relays are commonly used in various applications, such as controlling high-power circuits with low-power signals, providing over-current protection, and managing voltage regulation.

Relay's Purpose: 

A relay is used to turn on or off a separate electrical circuit.

Voltage/Current Control: 

Relays often use a low voltage or current to control a higher voltage or current.

Signal Transmission: 

A small switch can initiate the low voltage/current signal, which is then sent to the relay.

Wire Efficiency: 

This signal can be transmitted using small, inexpensive wires.

Relay’s Action: 

The relay, located near the load (the component that requires power), then manages the larger current.

Example: 

In a car, when you turn the ignition switch, it sends a signal to a relay near the starter motor, which then activates the starter motor.

Basically, it’s about using a small control signal to manage a larger power load efficiently.
