Connecting a battery directly to another component or system by wires is not recommended without proper protection for several reasons:

1. Risk of Short Circuit:

   - Potential Hazards:

   Directly connecting wires from a battery can easily cause a short circuit if the wires touch or if the circuit path has very low resistance. This can lead to a rapid discharge of the battery, generating heat, sparks, or even causing the battery to explode or catch fire.

2. Lack of Current Limiting:
   - Overcurrent Damage:

   Batteries can supply a large amount of current if not limited by a resistor or other current-limiting device. Connecting directly with wires could allow too much current to flow, potentially damaging electronic components or creating dangerous situations.

3. Heat Generation:
   - Thermal Runaway:

   Without appropriate load management, excessive current can cause wires and connected components to overheat. This heat can melt insulation, damage components, or create a fire hazard, especially in circuits with high current draw.

4. Component Damage:
   - Exceeding Voltage/Current Ratings:

   Directly connecting a battery may apply voltages or currents that exceed the ratings of the circuit components, leading to immediate or long-term damage.

5. Lack of Control:
   - No Regulation:

   Connecting directly by wires offers no way to control the voltage or current supplied to the circuit. Batteries can vary in voltage depending on their charge state, potentially causing inconsistent or unsafe operation.

Directly connecting a battery by wires is not recommended because it can lead to short circuits, excessive current flow, overheating, component damage, and lack of control over the power supplied to the circuit. Itâ€™s important to use proper connections, current limiting, and protection components to ensure safe and reliable operation.
