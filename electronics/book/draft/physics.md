### Concepts That Are Generic and Carry Over Directly

These are concepts that describe core principles, so they naturally apply to electronics:

Energy is a foundational concept across all physical systems. Whether in mechanics (kinetic or potential energy) or electronics (electrical or magnetic energy), energy represents the capacity to do work, and it is always conserved. The unit, Joule (J), is the same.

Power as the rate of energy transfer applies universally. In both physics and electronics, Watts (W) measure how quickly energy is used. For example, a mechanical engine and an electronic resistor both consume power, and we can calculate it consistently using formulas adapted to the context (force and velocity for mechanics, voltage and current for electronics).

Both resistance in electronics and friction in mechanics oppose motion, causing energy dissipation (often as heat). The idea of opposition to flow—whether of electric current or physical movement—carries over easily because they serve similar roles in regulating energy transfer.

### Concepts Requiring Adjustments for Electronics

Some concepts need modifications to fit the specific characteristics of electric systems, where energy is transferred and stored in ways unique to electromagnetic fields and electric charges:

In mechanics, potential energy is often tied to position in a gravitational field. In electronics, voltage represents electric potential energy per charge in an electric field. Voltage adjusts the idea of potential energy to describe electrical potential difference, an abstract quantity that doesn’t directly map to visible mechanical energy.

In physics, moving objects have mass and momentum, while in electronics, current is the flow of charge with no mass involved in the same way. Current requires an adapted understanding: it’s not a flow of "stuff" like air or water, but rather a flow of electrons or charge that interacts with fields rather than relying on mass.

These concepts are specific to electric and magnetic systems:
   - Capacitance adjusts the idea of storage to hold charge within an electric field.
   - Inductance describes energy storage in a magnetic field, resisting changes in current, somewhat like inertia but not based on mass or position.

Frequency in general physics often applies to oscillations or waves, such as sound. In electronics, however, AC and frequency describe oscillating currents and voltages, essential for signal processing and energy transfer. Here, frequency requires an adaptation to capture the specific behavior of electrical circuits.

Electronics, especially at small scales, involves quantum mechanics (e.g., semiconductor properties, tunneling), which doesn’t have a direct classical analogy. Concepts like resistance change at quantum scales, requiring unique laws and principles that differ from macroscopic physics.

### Why Some Concepts Need Adjustment

Electronics deals specifically with the flow of electric charge and the behavior of electromagnetic fields, introducing phenomena not encountered in classical mechanics, where forces typically act on masses. These unique behaviors require adapted concepts and new terms that capture the specific ways energy, force, and motion operate in electronic systems.

- Generic concepts like energy, power, and resistance transfer directly, providing a consistent foundation.
- Adjusted concepts reflect unique properties of electric charge and fields, capturing behaviors specific to electronics.

This combination of universal and specialized concepts is what makes electronics both accessible through fundamental physics and distinctive in its own right.

### Concepts that Map Directly

Power as the rate of energy transfer maps directly. Whether in mechanical systems (moving a weight) or electronic systems (powering a circuit), power is measured in Watts (W), and it represents how quickly energy is used or transferred.

Energy is a universal concept in both physics and electronics. In electronics, energy might be stored in capacitors or batteries and is measured in Joules (J), the same unit used for other energy forms like kinetic or potential energy.

While resistance is specific to electrical systems, it’s similar to friction in mechanics—both resist the flow of “motion” (current in electronics, objects in mechanics). In electronics, resistance is measured in Ohms (Ω), controlling the flow of current just as friction limits movement.

Voltage in electronics is like potential energy in physics—it represents stored energy available to do work. Just as gravitational potential energy represents energy based on position, voltage indicates the potential energy per charge that can drive current in a circuit.

### Concepts that Don’t Map Directly or Need Adapting

In mechanics, mass or objects move, while in electronics, it’s the flow of electric charge (current). There’s no direct analogy to mass in electronics since electrons flow without adding substantial mass, unlike moving objects in physics.

These are unique to electrical and magnetic systems with no exact equivalents in basic mechanics.
   - Inductance stores energy in magnetic fields when current flows, acting somewhat like inertia, resisting changes in current.
   - Capacitance stores energy in electric fields, related to the ability to hold charge, which doesn’t have a straightforward mechanical counterpart.

While fields are general physics concepts, magnetic and electric fields play a special, central role in electronics. Fields enable wireless energy transfer (e.g., inductive charging, radio signals), which has limited mechanical analogy beyond gravitational fields.

Concepts like frequency and AC are central in electronics for signal processing and alternating current systems. In physics, frequency is commonly tied to waves, but in electronics, it represents how currents and voltages oscillate, which doesn’t map to mechanics.

At micro and nano scales, electronics encounters quantum mechanics (e.g., electron tunneling, semiconductor properties), which rarely appears in macroscopic physics. Quantum effects are essential in designing transistors and semiconductors but are not present in classical physics on a visible scale.

### Why Some Concepts Don’t Map

Electronics deals specifically with the behavior of electric charges and fields, which often operate under unique principles (e.g., circuit laws, electromagnetic fields) that aren’t found in classical mechanics. This gives electronics its own set of principles and tools, though foundational physics concepts like energy, power, and force still provide a consistent base.

While electronics builds on physics, it also has specialized concepts that don’t fully map onto traditional physics, especially when dealing with electromagnetic fields, charge flow, and quantum effects. These differences are what make electronics its own field, bridging physical principles with unique behaviors of electric and magnetic phenomena.

Some concepts in physics are generic and fundamental enough that they apply directly to electronics without modification. These concepts describe basic aspects of the universe—like energy, power, and resistance—that are universal, whether in mechanical, thermal, or electrical systems. However, other concepts require adjustments or adaptations to fit the specific nature of electronics, especially due to the unique behavior of electric charges, fields, and currents.
