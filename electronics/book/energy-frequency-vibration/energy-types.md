Iron Box

Electrical energy is converted into heat energy. The surface of the iron box is heated when current passes through a resistive coil. This heat is used to iron clothes.

PENDING

What is a resistive coil? What does it look like? Need an image.

A resistive coil is a coil of wire. It is designed to have electrical resistance, which converts electrical energy into heat energy when current flows through it. This is found in toasters, ovens and electric stoves.

Heater

Electrical energy is transformed into heat energy. The resistive heating element keeps the space in a room warm.

PENDING

What does resistive heating element look like? Need an image.

A resistive element in a heater converts electrical energy into heat. The high resistance of the resistive element opposes the current flow. This generates heat, which warms up the surrounding area.

Fan

Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy. The motor rotates the fan blades, this creates airflow.

PENDING

Need an image.

Bulb

Electrical energy is transformed into light energy. The current flows through the filament to illuminate the area.

PENDING

Need an image.

A filament in a bulb is a thin wire. It can withstand the high heat generated by the electrical current. The resistance to the current in the filament causes it to heat up to a high temperature. This results in glowing of the filament which we can see as visible light.

Door Bell

Electrical energy is converted to sound energy. The circuit activates a buzzer, this produces the ringing sound.

PENDING

Need an image.

Fridge

Electrical energy powers a compressor, which transfers thermal energy from inside to outside the fridge, keeping food cool.

These devices we encounter in everyday life are examples of transforming one form of energy into another form of energy to perform useful function.
