Iron Box

Electrical energy is converted into heat energy. The surface of the iron box is heated when current passes through a resistive coil. This heat is used to iron clothes.

PENDING

Need an image.

A resistive coil is a coil of wire. It has electrical resistance. This wire converts electrical energy into heat energy when current flows through it. It is found in toasters, ovens and electric stoves.

Heater

Electrical energy is transformed into heat energy. The heater has a resistive element that has resistance. This element opposes the current flow. This generates the heat, which warms up the room.

This converts electrical energy into heat energy.

PENDING

What does resistive heating element look like? Need an image.

Fan

Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy. The motor rotates the fan blades, this creates airflow.

PENDING

Need an image.

Bulb

Electrical energy is transformed into light energy. The current flows through the filament to illuminate the area.

PENDING

Need an image.

A filament in a bulb is a thin wire. It can withstand the high heat generated by the electrical current. The resistance to the current in the filament causes it to heat up to a high temperature. This results in glowing of the filament which we see as visible light.

Door Bell

Electrical energy is converted to sound energy. The circuit activates a buzzer, this produces the ringing sound.

PENDING

Need an image.

Fridge

Electrical energy powers a compressor, which transfers thermal energy from inside to outside the fridge, keeping food cool.

These devices we encounter in everyday life are examples of transforming one form of energy into another form of energy to perform useful function.

In the context of electronic circuits the main types of energy involved are electrical energy. thermal energy, magnetic field energy, electric field energy, light energy and chemical energy.

The electrons have kinetic energy when they move. The flow of electrons creates an electric current. This is called as electrical energy.We measure the electrical energy in Joules or watt-seconds.

Thermal energy is the heat generated in electronic components such as resistors, battery, diode etc. Unless it is an appliance where the usefulness is in the heat, this heat is undesirable. This undesirable heat is lost energy during the conversion process.

Magnetic Field Energy is found in inductors and transformers.

Electric Field Energy is stored in  Capacitors.

Light Energy is Converted in LEDs, photodiodes, displays and optical sensors

Chemical Energy is present in batteries, fuel cells and chemical sensors.

PENDING

Batteries also have Chemical to Electrical.

   - Electrical → Heat (Resistors)
   - Electrical ↔ Magnetic (Inductors)
   - Electrical ↔ Chemical (Batteries)
   - Electrical → Light (LEDs)
