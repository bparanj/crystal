Frequency is how often something happens over a period of time.

Heart Rate (Beats per Minute)

The human heart rate beats at 60 times in a minute. Its frequency is 60 beats per minute. Each beat repeats. The frequency is about how often these beats occur in a given time frame.

Blinking Light (Flashes per Second)

If a blinking light flashes twice every second, its frequency is 2 flashes per second (or 2 Hz). The faster it blinks, the higher the frequency. Frequency here is the number of flashes per second, showing how often the light turns on and off.

In electronics, frequency refers to how often a periodic signal or oscillation occurs in a given amount of time, usually measured in Hertz (Hz).

Alternating Current (AC) Power Supply

In household AC power, the current oscillates back and forth at a frequency of 60 Hz. This means the electric current changes direction 60 times per second. Frequency here describes the rate at which the AC current switches direction.

Radio Signals

Radio stations broadcast at specific frequencies, such as 100 MHz (megahertz). The frequency represents how many oscillations the radio signal has per second. Tuning your radio to a station means selecting the frequency that matches the stationâ€™s signal.

Frequency is used to distinguish radio signals, where each station transmits at a unique rate of oscillation.

In these examples, frequency measures how often a repetitive event occurs. The event could be the oscillation of current, the broadcast of a radio wave, or the blinking of LEDs.
