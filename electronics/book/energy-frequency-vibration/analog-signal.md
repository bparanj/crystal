Separate in scope and out of scope

The real world naturally consists of analog signals. Analog signals vary continuously and can take any value within a given range. Examples of analog signals in the natural world include:

Sound Waves:

Sound is a pressure wave that varies continuously as it moves through air as continous pressure variations.

Light Intensity:

Light from natural sources, like the sun, varies smoothly in intensity and wavelength.

Temperature:

Temperature changes gradually and can have any value within a range.

Human Voice:

When we speak, our vocal cords create sound waves that are inherently analog.
