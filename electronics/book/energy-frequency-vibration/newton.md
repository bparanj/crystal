A newton (N) is a unit of force. It can be visualized using simple, physical examples of pushing or pulling objects.

PENDING EXAMPLE

Picky only one example from below and summarize it in concise way.

1. Lifting an Apple:

   - A force of about 1 newton is roughly what you need to hold a small apple (weighing about 100 grams) in your hand against the pull of Earth's gravity. If you imagine lifting that apple, you're applying approximately 1 newton of upward force.

PENDING

   Why do I need to consider weight here?

2. Gravity on Objects:

   - For every kilogram of mass, Earth exerts about 9.8 newtons of force (due to gravity). So, if you're holding a 1-kilogram object, like a textbook, you’re feeling about 9.8 newtons of downward force in your hand.

4. Acceleration Example:
   - Using Newton’s second law, F = ma (force = mass × acceleration), a newton can also be visualized as the force needed to accelerate a 1-kilogram object at 1 meter per second squared. Picture a toy car being pushed to start moving—applying a small force results in a small acceleration.

   - Force can be pushing or pulling
   - Not the same as weight or mass
   - Changes with gravity (less on moon, more on Jupiter)
