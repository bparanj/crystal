Step 15

Run the simulation. You will see the red LED turn on.

The top left terminal of the pushbutton is called Terminal 1b. Fig 20.png. This is not used in this circuit.

This experiment demonstrates the concept of using a transistor as a switch in a circuit to control an LED. Here are the main concepts illustrated:


The NPN transistor acts as an electronic switch, controlling the current flow from the battery to the LED. When the transistor’s base receives a small current (from pressing the pushbutton), it allows a larger current to flow from the collector to the emitter.

The pushbutton provides the base current to the transistor. When pressed, the pushbutton allows a small current to reach the transistor’s base, turning it “on” and enabling the main current to flow through the LED, lighting it up.

This setup demonstrates the transistor’s amplification capability in switching. A small input current at the base enables a larger current to flow between the collector and emitter, powering the LED.

Measure the current to show the amplification of the transistor

When the pushbutton is pressed, the circuit path is completed through the transistor, allowing current from the battery's positive terminal to flow through the collector-emitter path, through the LED, and to ground, lighting up the LED.

This experiment shows how a transistor can act as a switch, where a small base current (controlled by a pushbutton) enables a larger current flow, turning on an LED. This principle is widely used in electronics to control devices and manage power with low-power control signals.
