Step 7

Anode of the LED.

Image 7

Connect the Anode of the LED to the transistor. This is the green wire from f5 to f9.

Image 8

Step 8

Connect the Cathode of the LED to c4 in the breadboard.

Step 9

The collector of the transistor.

Image 11

Connect the Cathode of the LED to the collector of the transistor.

Image 12

Step 10

Emitter of the transistor.

Image 13

Connect the emitter of the transistor to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Image 14

Step 11

Connect the resistor to the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. This is the red wire that connects j13 in the breadboard to the postive terminal of the power supply.

Image 15

Step 12

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the postive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Image 16

Step 13

The base terminal of the transistor. This needs to go below the step 14.

Step 14

Take a function generator.

Image 18

Step 15

Set the function generator parameters to values shown.

Image 19

Step 14

Connect the positive terminal of the function generator to the base terminal of the transistor.

Image 20

Step 16

Connect the negative terminal of the function generator to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Step 17

Run the simulation.

Image 22

Step 18

You can see the LED is on.

Image 23

When the input waveform which is a square waveform. When the input is at the maximum, the LED will be on. When the input is at the minimum, it will be off.

This experiment  the concept of using a transistor as a switch in a circuit to control an LED.
