Transistor

Demonstrate the use of transistor in a circuit.

Components

1. 9 volt battery
2. Resistor with 1 k ohm (quantity: 2)
3. NPN Transistor
4. Red LED
5. Pushbutton

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery.

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect one end of the resistor to the negative terminal of the breadboard and the other end to the section C of the breadboard.

Step 5

Connect the second resistor the same way as the first resistor.

Step 6

Connect the transistor to the section B of the breadboard.

Step 7

Connect the red LED to the section B of the breadboard.

Step 8

Connect the pushbutton to the breadboard such that it is connected to the section B and C of the breadboard.

Step 9

The rightmost terminal of the transistor is the emitter. Connect the emitter terminal of the transistor to the Anode terminal of the LED.

14.png shows Anode but it has connections so it cannot be used here. Create a new picture for showing Anode.

13.png shows the Cathode

Step 10

The middle terminal of the transistor is the Base. Connect the Base of the transistor to the first resistor.

Step 11

The left leg of the LED is the Cathode. Connect the Cathode of the LED to the second resistor.

Step 12

Connect the positive terminal of the breadboard to the top right terminal of the pushbutton. Does this terminal have a name?

Step 13

Connect the positive terminal of the breadboard to the first terminal of the transistor. What is the name of the first terminal? Show the name in the screenshot.

Step 14

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 15

Run the simulation. You will see the red LED turn on.


The top left terminal of the pushbutton is called Terminal 1b. Fig 20.png.
