Transistor

Demonstrate the use of transistor as a switch in a circuit.

Components

1. 9 volt battery
2. Resistor with 1 k ohm (quantity: 2)
3. NPN Transistor
4. Red LED
5. Pushbutton

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery.

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect one end of the resistor to the negative terminal of the breadboard and the other end to the section C of the breadboard. The resistor connects to b8 and the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 5

Connect the second resistor the same way as the first resistor. This connects to b18 and the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 6

Connect the transistor to the section B of the breadboard. The green wire connects f8 and e8.

Step 7

Connect the red LED to the section B of the breadboard. The Cathode is connected to i18 and the Anode to i19.

Step 8

Connect the pushbutton to the breadboard such that it is connected to the section B and C of the breadboard. The Terminal 2b of the pushbutton is connected to the f26. The Terminal 1a of the pushbutton is connected to the e24.

Step 9

The rightmost terminal of the transistor is the emitter. Connect the emitter terminal of the transistor to the Anode terminal of the LED. The green wire connects g9 to g19.

Step 10

The middle terminal of the transistor is the Base. Connect the Base of the transistor to the first resistor. The green wire connects f8 to e8.

Step 11

The left leg of the LED is the Cathode. Connect the Cathode of the LED to the second resistor. The green wire connects f18 to e18.

Step 12

Connect the positive terminal of the breadboard to the top right terminal of the pushbutton. The red wire connects the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard to j26.

Image 

Step 13

Connect the positive terminal of the breadboard to the Collector of the transistor. The red wire connects the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard to g7.

Image 

Step 14

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 15

Run the simulation. You will see the red LED turn on.

The top left terminal of the pushbutton is called Terminal 1b. Fig 20.png. This is not used in this circuit.
