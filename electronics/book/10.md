Demonstrate how a transistor can be used as a switch to control a LED.

PENDING

Cut the apprpriate lines and paste it into the steps.

Materials:

- NPN transistor (e.g., 2N2222)
- Resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ for the base, 220 Ω for the LED)
- LED or small light bulb
- Battery (e.g., 9V)
- Switch
- Wires for connections

   - Connect the base of the transistor to the positive terminal of the battery through the 1 kΩ resistor.
   - Place the switch in series with the base resistor.

Operation:

   - When the switch is open, no current flows to the base of the transistor, so the LED remains off.
   - When the switch is closed, a small current flows into the base, allowing a larger current to flow from the collector to the emitter, lighting up the LED.

This experiment shows how a small current at the base of the transistor can control a larger current flowing through the collector-emitter path, acting as a switch.

PENDING

Measure the current to show the amplification of the transistor. Maybe a different experiment?

Transistor is used to control the LED, demonstrating its use as a switch. When the function generator applies a high voltage (square wave maximum) to the base of the transistor, the transistor allows current to flow from the collector to the emitter, turning the LED on.

This demonstrates the switching behavior of transistors, where they conduct or block current based on the input voltage.

The function generator provides a square wave signal to the transistor's base, showing how an external signal can control the state of a transistor.

The square wave signal alternates between high and low values, turning the transistor on and off periodically, which makes the LED blink in sync with the waveform.

The resistor in series with the power rail is used to limit current, which is necessary to protect both the LED and the transistor.

The high and low levels of the square wave from the function generator control the LED, providing a practical demonstration of how digital signals or AC waveforms can control an electronic component.

When the square wave reaches its high value, the base of the transistor is biased, allowing current flow and turning the LED on. When it reaches its low value, the transistor stops conducting, turning the LED off.

The LED blinks on and off with the input square wave, showing how dynamic signals can control the state of components in real-time.

This experiment demonstrates the use of a transistor as a switch, with an LED responding to an external AC signal, as well as basic concepts like component polarity, current limiting, and breadboard connections. This setup models how digital signals can control components in electronics.
