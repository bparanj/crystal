A basic inverter (NOT gate) circuit.

Components:

1. 1x NPN transistor (2N3904)
2. 1x 1kΩ resistor (R1)
3. 1x 10kΩ resistor (R2)
4. 5V power supply
5. Breadboard
6. Connecting wires

How it works:

- When the input is LOW (0V), the transistor is OFF, and the output is HIGH (≈5V)
- When the input is HIGH (5V), the transistor turns ON, and the output is LOW (≈0V)

Steps:

1. Place a breadboard
2. Connect the 5V power supply to the power rail
3. Place the NPN transistor
4. Connect R1 (1kΩ) from 5V to the collector
5. Connect R2 (10kΩ) to the base
6. Connect the emitter to ground
7. Take the output from the collector


1. When R2 is connected to ground or left unconnected (floating):
   - The transistor's base doesn't receive enough voltage to turn ON
   - The transistor stays OFF (like an open switch)
   - Current flows through R1 → LED → R3 → Ground
   - So the LED stays ON

2. When R2 is connected to 5V (positive):
   - The transistor's base receives voltage through R2
   - The transistor turns ON (like a closed switch)
   - The collector-emitter path becomes almost a short circuit
   - Most current flows through R1 → transistor → ground (bypassing the LED)
   - So the LED turns OFF

This is normal behavior because:
- The transistor's base-emitter junction needs about 0.7V to conduct
- When floating or grounded, this voltage isn't reached
- The high-value resistor R2 (10kΩ) also helps prevent any stray voltage from accidentally turning on the transistor

So you're seeing the correct operation of the inverter:
- Input HIGH (5V) → Output LOW (LED OFF)
- Input LOW (0V or floating) → Output HIGH (LED ON)
