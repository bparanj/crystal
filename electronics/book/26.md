Step 13

Connect the other end of the inductor to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. This is the black wire from f16 to the ground.

Image 20

Step 14

Connect the resistor to the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. This is the red line from j4 to the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Step 15

Connect a 9 volt battery to the breadboard

Image 22

Step 16

Run the simulation. Turn on the switch to close the circuit. The blue LED turns on.

Image 25

Step 17

Turn off the switch. The red LED turns on.

Image 26

Step 18

Flip the switch again. It turns off the red LED and turns on the blue LED.
