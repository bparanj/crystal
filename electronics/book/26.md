Summarize:

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of an inductive energy storage circuit. It shows the role of inductors in storing and releasing energy when the circuit switches states.

1. Switching Behavior:
   - The slide switch controls whether the circuit is connected to the power supply or disconnected.
   - Turning the switch on powers the circuit, lighting the blue LED.
   - Turning the switch off causes the red LED to light, as energy stored in the inductor is released.

2. Inductive Energy Storage:
   - The inductor stores energy in its magnetic field when current flows through it.
   - When the circuit is disconnected (switch off), the inductor resists the sudden drop in current by releasing its stored energy.
   - This released energy powers the red LED momentarily after the switch is turned off.

3. Direction of Current:
   - The blue LED lights up during normal current flow when the switch is on.
   - The red LED lights up when the inductor discharges, as the polarity of the current reverses.

4. Current Flow Through LEDs:
   - LEDs are polarized components that light up only when current flows in the forward direction.
   - This circuit demonstrates how current changes direction in response to the inductor's behavior during switching.

- Energy Storage: Demonstrates how inductors store and release energy in circuits.
- Switching Circuits: Useful for understanding how inductors behave in switches, relays, and transient protection.
- LED Polarity: Highlights the importance of correct orientation and current flow in LEDs.

This experiment demonstrates inductive behavior, switching circuits, and energy transfer.
