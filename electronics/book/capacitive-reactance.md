**Capacitive reactance** is the opposition that a capacitor offers to alternating current (AC) in a circuit. It depends on the frequency of the AC signal and the capacitance of the capacitor.

### Key Formula:
\[
X_C = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}
\]
where:
- \( X_C \) is the capacitive reactance (measured in ohms),
- \( f \) is the frequency of the AC signal,
- \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor.

### Explanation:
- **Inversely Proportional**: Capacitive reactance decreases as frequency or capacitance increases. This means high-frequency signals pass through a capacitor more easily than low-frequency signals.
- **AC vs. DC**: In DC circuits (where \( f = 0 \)), capacitive reactance is infinite, effectively blocking current. In AC circuits, the capacitor allows current to flow based on the reactance value.

Capacitive reactance plays a role in controlling AC current flow in circuits with capacitors.
