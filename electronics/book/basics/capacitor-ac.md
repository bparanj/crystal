### **Demonstrate Capacitor Passing AC**

#### **Objective**

Demonstrate how a capacitor blocks direct current (DC) but allows alternating current (AC) to pass through.

### **Components**

1. **AC Power Source** (e.g., 6V or 12V AC)
2. **Capacitor** (e.g., 1 µF, non-polarized or polarized if voltage rating is higher than AC voltage)
3. **LED** or a small **incandescent bulb** (for visual feedback)
4. **Resistor** (e.g., 1 kΩ, to protect the LED or bulb)
5. **Multimeter** (optional, to measure voltage across components)

### **Concept**

Capacitors block DC but allow AC to pass by continuously charging and discharging in response to the alternating voltage. This property demonstrates the capacitor's **reactive behavior** in AC circuits.

### **Steps**

#### Step 1:

1. Connect one terminal of the **AC power source** to one terminal of the **capacitor**.
2. Connect the other terminal of the capacitor to one terminal of the **LED** (via a resistor, if required for protection).
3. Connect the other terminal of the LED to the second terminal of the AC power source.

#### Step 2: Observe with AC

1. Turn on the AC power source.
2. Observe the LED or bulb lighting up, showing that AC is passing through the capacitor.

### **Observation**

- With AC: The LED or bulb lights up, indicating that the capacitor allows AC to pass by continuously charging and discharging with the alternating voltage.

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

**Capacitor Passing AC:**
   - Alternating current continuously changes direction, allowing the capacitor to charge and discharge, effectively enabling current to "pass through."
**Reactance:**
   - The capacitor's resistance to AC (reactance) depends on the frequency of the AC signal; higher frequencies pass more easily.

### **Applications**

- Capacitors are used in AC circuits for signal coupling, filtering, and timing applications.
- The principle is critical in designing circuits like high-pass filters and AC coupling in audio and RF systems.

This experiment provides a simple yet profound demonstration of a capacitor's fundamental behavior in AC and DC circuits.
