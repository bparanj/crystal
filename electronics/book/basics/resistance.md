**Resistance** is the property of a material or component that opposes the flow of electric current in a circuit. It quantifies how much the material resists the movement of electric charges.

---

### **Definition**
Resistance is the ratio of the voltage (\(V\)) across a conductor to the current (\(I\)) flowing through it, as described by **Ohm's Law**:
\[
R = \frac{V}{I}
\]

Where:
- \(R\): Resistance (measured in ohms, \(\Omega\)).
- \(V\): Voltage across the component (in volts, \(V\)).
- \(I\): Current through the component (in amperes, \(A\)).

---

### **Units**
- **SI Unit**: **Ohm (\(\Omega\))**
  - \(1 \, \Omega = 1 \, \text{volt per ampere}\)

---

### **Physical Meaning**
Resistance determines how much a material or component hinders the flow of electrons. Higher resistance means less current for a given voltage.

---

### **Factors Affecting Resistance**
1. **Material**:
   - Conductors (e.g., copper, silver): Low resistance.
   - Insulators (e.g., rubber, glass): High resistance.
2. **Length** (\(L\)):
   - Resistance increases with the length of the material:
     \[
     R \propto L
     \]
3. **Cross-Sectional Area** (\(A\)):
   - Resistance decreases with a larger cross-sectional area:
     \[
     R \propto \frac{1}{A}
     \]
4. **Temperature**:
   - For most conductors, resistance increases with temperature.
   - For some materials (e.g., semiconductors), resistance decreases with temperature.
5. **Resistivity** (\(\rho\)):
   - A material property that quantifies intrinsic resistance.
     \[
     R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
     \]
     Where:
     - \(\rho\): Resistivity (in \(\Omega \cdot \text{m}\)).
     - \(L\): Length (in meters).
     - \(A\): Cross-sectional area (in square meters).

---

### **Applications**
1. **Current Limiting**:
   - Resistors are used in circuits to control current flow.
2. **Heat Generation**:
   - Resistance converts electrical energy into heat (e.g., heaters, lightbulbs).
3. **Voltage Division**:
   - Resistors create voltage drops in circuits, enabling signal conditioning and measurement.

---

### **Example**
- A resistor with \( R = 100 \, \Omega \) and a voltage of \( V = 10 \, \text{V} \) across it will have a current of:
  \[
  I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{10}{100} = 0.1 \, \text{A}
  \]

---

Resistance determines how current flows and how voltage is distributed.
