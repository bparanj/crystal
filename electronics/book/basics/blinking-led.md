### **Demonstrate Polarity and Rectification**

#### **Objective**

Demonstrate the importance of **polarity** for an LED and how it acts as a **rectifier**, allowing current to flow in only one direction when connected to an AC source.

### **Components**

1. **Low-Voltage AC Source** (e.g., 6V or 12V AC for safety)
2. **Red LED**
3. **Resistor** (e.g., 1 kÎ© to limit current)

### **Concept**

An LED is a polarized component that allows current to flow in only one direction. When connected to an AC source, the LED will blink, lighting up only during the half-cycles of the AC waveform where the polarity matches the LED's forward bias.

### **Steps**

#### Step 1:

1. Connect one terminal of the **AC source** to one terminal of the **resistor**.
2. Connect the other terminal of the resistor to the **anode** (long leg) of the **LED**.
3. Connect the **cathode** (short leg) of the LED to the other terminal of the AC source.

#### Step 2: Run the Experiment

1. Power on the AC source.
2. Observe the LED blinking as it lights up during half of the AC cycle.

### **Observation**

- The LED blinks because it conducts current only during the positive half-cycles of the AC waveform when it is forward-biased.
- During the negative half-cycles, the LED does not light up as it is reverse-biased and blocks current.

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **Polarity and Rectification:**
   - The LED lights up only when forward-biased, acting as a rectifier by blocking current in the reverse direction.
2. **Half-Wave Rectification:**
   - This experiment introduces the concept of half-wave rectification, where the LED effectively converts an AC waveform into a pulsating DC signal.
3. **AC Waveform Behavior:**
   - Shows how alternating current changes direction periodically, affecting the behavior of polarized components like LEDs.

### **Applications**

- This principle is foundational for understanding rectifiers, used in power supplies to convert AC to DC.
- Demonstrates how LEDs can be used as indicators for AC polarity or signal presence.

This simple experiment provides an intuitive understanding of polarity, rectification, and AC waveform behavior with minimal components.
