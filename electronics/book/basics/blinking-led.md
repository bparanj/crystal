The output wave form is not fully rectified, the upper cycle is reduced a bit. Remove the rectification part and only show the polarity? Polarity is already covered in 13.md

### **Demonstrate Rectification**

Demonstrate the importance of **polarity** for an LED and how it acts as a **rectifier**, allowing current to flow in only one direction when connected to an AC source.

### **Components**

1. **Low-Voltage AC Source** (e.g., 5V)
2. **Red LED**
3. **Resistor** (e.g., 1 kÎ© to limit current)

An LED is a polarized component that allows current to flow in only one direction. When connected to an AC source, the LED will blink, lighting up only during the half-cycles of the AC waveform where the polarity matches the LED's forward bias.

### **Steps**

#### Step 1:

1. Connect one terminal of the **AC source** to one terminal of the **resistor**.
2. Connect the other terminal of the resistor to the **anode** (long leg) of the **LED**.
3. Connect the **cathode** (short leg) of the LED to the other terminal of the AC source.

#### Step 2:

1. Power on the AC source.
2. Observe the LED blinking as it lights up during half of the AC cycle.

### **Observation**

- The LED blinks because it conducts current only during the positive half-cycles of the AC waveform when it is forward-biased.
- During the negative half-cycles, the LED does not light up as it is reverse-biased and blocks current.

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **Polarity and Rectification:**

   - The LED lights up only when forward-biased, acting as a rectifier by blocking current in the reverse direction.

2. **Half-Wave Rectification:**

   - This experiment introduces the concept of half-wave rectification, where the LED effectively converts an AC waveform into a pulsating DC signal.

3. **AC Waveform Behavior:**

   - Shows how alternating current changes direction periodically, affecting the behavior of polarized components like LEDs.

### **Applications**

- Rectifiers are used in power supplies to convert AC to DC.
- Demonstrates how LEDs can be used as indicators for AC polarity or signal presence.

This experiment demonstrates polarity, rectification, and AC waveform behavior.
