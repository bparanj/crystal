When we apply Ohm’s law (I = V/R) to a theoretical circuit with zero resistance, it suggests that the current would be infinitely large. However, no real circuit behaves this way because:

1. **Real Materials Have Non-Zero Resistance:**  
   Even conductors marketed as “very good conductors” still have a small amount of resistance. There is no perfectly zero-resistance material under normal conditions (except superconductors at very low temperatures, which introduce their own complexities).

2. **Internal Resistance of Sources:**  
   Real batteries and power supplies have internal resistance. This means that the voltage source itself cannot deliver infinite current. As you draw more current, the source’s internal resistance drops the voltage, preventing the current from rising without limit.

3. **Physical Limitations and Damage:**  
   If you tried to approximate a zero-resistance path (like a near-direct short circuit), the current would become extremely high, potentially limited only by the source’s ability to supply it. This would cause wires to heat, fuses to blow, components to burn out, or the power supply’s protection mechanisms to trigger. Essentially, the circuit would fail or be damaged before reaching anything like “infinite” current.

In short, the theoretical idea of infinite current assumes ideal conditions that don’t exist in the real world. Real circuits always have some form of resistance or limitation that prevents infinite current from occurring.

### **Demonstrate Ohm’s Law**

PENDING

Run experiment

Demonstrate **Ohm’s Law**—the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit.

### **Components**

1. **Battery** (e.g., 9V)
2. **Resistor** (e.g., \(1 \, \text{k}\Omega\))
3. **Multimeter** (to measure current and voltage)

Ohm’s Law states:
\[
V = I \times R
\]
Where:
- \(V\) is the voltage across the resistor (in volts).
- \(I\) is the current flowing through the resistor (in amperes).
- \(R\) is the resistance (in ohms).

This experiment shows how increasing resistance decreases current and how voltage, current, and resistance are mathematically linked.

### **Steps**

#### Step 1:

1. Connect one terminal of the **resistor** to the positive terminal of the **battery**.
2. Connect the other terminal of the resistor to the **negative terminal** of the battery.

#### Step 2: Measure Current

1. Insert the **multimeter** in series with the resistor to measure current (\(I\)).
2. Note the current value.

#### Step 3: Measure Voltage

1. Connect the **multimeter** across the resistor to measure voltage (\(V\)).
2. Note the voltage value.

#### Step 4: Verify Ohm’s Law

1. Using the formula:
   \[
   I = \frac{V}{R}
   \]
   Calculate the current using the measured voltage and known resistance.
2. Compare this calculated current to the multimeter reading.

### **Observation**

- If the battery voltage is \(9V\) and the resistor is \(1 \, \text{k}\Omega\):
  \[
  I = \frac{9}{1000} = 0.009 \, \text{A} \, \text{(or 9 mA)}
  \]

- The multimeter should confirm this result, demonstrating the practical application of Ohm’s Law.

### **Variations**

1. **Change Resistance:**
   - Replace the \(1 \, \text{k}\Omega\) resistor with \(500 \, \Omega\) or \(2 \, \text{k}\Omega\) and observe the current change. A lower resistance increases current, while a higher resistance decreases current.

2. **Measure Power:**
   - Use the measured values to calculate power dissipated by the resistor:
     \[
     P = V \times I
     \]

1. **Ohm’s Law:** Voltage, current, and resistance relationship.
2. **Current Limiting:** Importance of resistance to control current flow.
3. **Power Dissipation:** The resistor converts electrical energy into heat, demonstrating energy transformation.

This experiment is basic for understanding electronic circuit behavior.
