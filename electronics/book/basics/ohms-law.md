### **Demonstrate Ohm’s Law**

#### **Objective**

Demonstrate **Ohm’s Law**—the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit.

### **Components**

1. **Battery** (e.g., 9V)
2. **Resistor** (e.g., \(1 \, \text{k}\Omega\))
3. **Multimeter** (to measure current and voltage)

### **Concept**

Ohm’s Law states:
\[
V = I \times R
\]
Where:
- \(V\) is the voltage across the resistor (in volts).
- \(I\) is the current flowing through the resistor (in amperes).
- \(R\) is the resistance (in ohms).

This experiment shows how increasing resistance decreases current and how voltage, current, and resistance are mathematically linked.

### **Steps**

#### Step 1: 

1. Connect one terminal of the **resistor** to the positive terminal of the **battery**.
2. Connect the other terminal of the resistor to the **negative terminal** of the battery.

#### Step 2: Measure Current

1. Insert the **multimeter** in series with the resistor to measure current (\(I\)).
2. Note the current value.

#### Step 3: Measure Voltage

1. Connect the **multimeter** across the resistor to measure voltage (\(V\)).
2. Note the voltage value.

#### Step 4: Verify Ohm’s Law

1. Using the formula:
   \[
   I = \frac{V}{R}
   \]
   Calculate the current using the measured voltage and known resistance.
2. Compare this calculated current to the multimeter reading.

### **Observation**

- If the battery voltage is \(9V\) and the resistor is \(1 \, \text{k}\Omega\):
  \[
  I = \frac{9}{1000} = 0.009 \, \text{A} \, \text{(or 9 mA)}
  \]

- The multimeter should confirm this result, demonstrating the practical application of Ohm’s Law.

### **Variations**

1. **Change Resistance:**
   - Replace the \(1 \, \text{k}\Omega\) resistor with \(500 \, \Omega\) or \(2 \, \text{k}\Omega\) and observe the current change. A lower resistance increases current, while a higher resistance decreases current.

2. **Measure Power:**
   - Use the measured values to calculate power dissipated by the resistor:
     \[
     P = V \times I
     \]

1. **Ohm’s Law:** Voltage, current, and resistance relationship.
2. **Current Limiting:** Importance of resistance to control current flow.
3. **Power Dissipation:** The resistor converts electrical energy into heat, demonstrating energy transformation.

This experiment is basic for understanding electronic circuit behavior.
