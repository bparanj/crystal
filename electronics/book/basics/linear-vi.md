The **linear relationship between current and voltage** is described by **Ohm's Law**, which states:

\[
I = \frac{V}{R}
\]

Where:
- \(I\): Current through the conductor (in amperes, \(A\)).
- \(V\): Voltage across the conductor (in volts, \(V\)).
- \(R\): Resistance of the conductor (in ohms, \(\Omega\)).

---

### **Key Characteristics of the Linear Relationship**

1. **Direct Proportionality**:
   - Current (\(I\)) is directly proportional to voltage (\(V\)) when resistance (\(R\)) is constant.
   - Doubling the voltage across a resistor doubles the current through it.
   - This relationship is linear, meaning a plot of \(I\) vs. \(V\) is a straight line.

2. **Slope of the Line**:
   - The slope of the \(I\)-\(V\) graph represents the reciprocal of resistance (\(1/R\)).
   - Steeper slopes correspond to lower resistance, and flatter slopes correspond to higher resistance.

3. **Conditions for Linearity**:
   - The material must behave as an **ohmic conductor**, meaning it follows Ohmâ€™s Law.
   - Examples: Metals like copper and aluminum, under normal operating conditions.

### **Graphical Representation**

- **Ohmic Conductors**:
  - For resistors and other ohmic materials, the \(I\)-\(V\) graph is a straight line passing through the origin.
  - Equation: \(I = V/R\)

- **Non-Ohmic Conductors**:
  - Materials like diodes or transistors do not show a linear relationship. Their \(I\)-\(V\) curves are non-linear.

---

### **Real-World Example**
- Consider a resistor of \(10 \, \Omega\):
  - When \(V = 10 \, \text{V}\), \(I = 10/10 = 1 \, \text{A}\).
  - When \(V = 20 \, \text{V}\), \(I = 20/10 = 2 \, \text{A}\).
  - Doubling the voltage doubles the current, illustrating the linearity.

### **Applications of the Linear Relationship**
1. **Circuit Analysis**:
   - Simplifies calculations of current and voltage in resistive circuits.
2. **Design**:
   - Helps in selecting appropriate resistors for voltage and current regulation.
3. **Testing Materials**:
   - Used to identify whether a material is ohmic (linear) or non-ohmic (non-linear).

The linear relationship between current and voltage is used in analysis and design of resistive circuits.
