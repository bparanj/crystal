In electrical circuits, **dependent sources** and **independent sources** are types of ideal sources that provide voltage or current. 

---

### **1. Definition**
- **Independent Source**:
  - A source whose output (voltage or current) is constant and does not depend on any other variable in the circuit.
  - Examples: A battery, a DC voltage source, or an AC generator.

- **Dependent Source**:
  - A source whose output (voltage or current) depends on another variable in the circuit, such as voltage or current at a different location.
  - Also called a **controlled source**.

### **2. Symbol in Circuit Diagrams**
- **Independent Source**:
  - Voltage: \( \bigoplus \bigominus \) (DC) or \( \sim \) (AC).
  - Current: \( \rightarrow \) with a circle.

- **Dependent Source**:
  - Voltage: Diamond-shaped symbol with \( \bigoplus \bigominus \) inside.
  - Current: Diamond-shaped symbol with an arrow inside.

---

### **3. Behavior**
- **Independent Source**:
  - Provides a fixed voltage or current regardless of what happens elsewhere in the circuit.

- **Dependent Source**:
  - Its value is determined by a specific circuit parameter, such as:
    - Voltage across a component (voltage-controlled).
    - Current through a component (current-controlled).

### **4. Types of Dependent Sources**
Dependent sources are categorized based on the type of control and output:

| **Control**              | **Output**              | **Type**                       | **Example Notation** |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Voltage-Controlled       | Voltage                | Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS) | \( V_x = kV_c \)    |
| Voltage-Controlled       | Current                | Voltage-Controlled Current Source (VCCS) | \( I_x = kV_c \)    |
| Current-Controlled       | Voltage                | Current-Controlled Voltage Source (CCVS) | \( V_x = kI_c \)    |
| Current-Controlled       | Current                | Current-Controlled Current Source (CCCS) | \( I_x = kI_c \)    |

Where:
- \( V_x \): Output voltage of the dependent source.
- \( I_x \): Output current of the dependent source.
- \( V_c \): Controlling voltage.
- \( I_c \): Controlling current.
- \( k \): Proportional constant (gain).

---

### **5. Applications**
- **Independent Sources**:
  - Used to provide power to circuits.
  - Examples: Batteries, generators, AC power supplies.

- **Dependent Sources**:
  - Used in circuit models for amplifiers, transistors, and operational amplifiers.
  - Examples:
    - A **VCVS** can represent an operational amplifier.
    - A **CCCS** can represent a current gain in a transistor.

---

### **6. Mathematical Representation**
- **Independent Source**:
  - Voltage Source: \( V = \text{constant} \)
  - Current Source: \( I = \text{constant} \)

- **Dependent Source**:
  - Voltage or Current is expressed as:
    \[
    V_x = k \cdot V_c \quad \text{or} \quad I_x = k \cdot I_c
    \]

### **Comparison Table**

| **Aspect**              | **Independent Source**            | **Dependent Source**              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Output**               | Constant voltage or current       | Depends on another circuit variable |
| **Symbol**               | Circle                            | Diamond                           |
| **Control**              | No control needed                | Controlled by voltage or current  |
| **Applications**         | Power supply for circuits         | Amplifiers, transistor models     |
| **Examples**             | Battery, AC generator             | Operational amplifier, transistor |

---

In summary:
- An **independent source** provides a constant voltage or current irrespective of circuit conditions.
- A **dependent source** generates voltage or current based on a controlling variable within the circuit, often used to model active components.
