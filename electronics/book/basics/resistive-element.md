A resistive element, commonly known as a resistor, is a fundamental component in electronics that introduces electrical resistance into a circuit.

1. **Function**:
   - **Resistance**: Resistors oppose the flow of electric current, creating a voltage drop across their terminals. This property is known as resistance, measured in ohms (Î©).
   - **Ohm's Law**: The relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) is defined by Ohm's Law: \( V = IR \). This means the voltage across a resistor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it.

2. **Types of Resistors**:
   - **Fixed Resistors**: These have a constant resistance value. They are used in circuits where a specific resistance is needed.
   - **Variable Resistors**: These allow for adjustment of resistance. Examples include potentiometers and rheostats.

3. **Applications**:
   - **Current Limiting**: Resistors are used to limit the amount of current flowing through a circuit.
   - **Voltage Division**: They can divide voltages in a circuit, creating reference voltages.
   - **Biasing**: Resistors are used to set the operating point of active devices like transistors.
   - **Signal Conditioning**: They help in shaping and conditioning signals in various electronic applications.

4. **Construction**:
   - Resistors can be made from various materials, including carbon, metal film, and wire-wound. Each type has different characteristics suitable for specific applications.

5. **Power Rating**:
   - Resistors dissipate electrical energy as heat. The power rating, measured in watts (W), indicates how much power a resistor can safely dissipate without being damaged.
