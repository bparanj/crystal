**Electric potential** and **voltage** are closely related concepts in electricity that describe the energy associated with electric charges and their movement. Understanding these terms is essential for analyzing electrical systems.

### **1. Electric Potential**

- **Definition**: 
  Electric potential is the amount of electric potential energy per unit charge at a specific point in an electric field. It represents the ability of a location in the field to do work on a charge.

- **Formula**:
  \[
  V = \frac{U}{q}
  \]
  Where:
  - \(V\): Electric potential (in volts, \(V\))
  - \(U\): Electric potential energy (in joules, \(J\))
  - \(q\): Charge (in coulombs, \(C\))

- **Units**: 
  Measured in **volts (V)**, where \(1 \, \text{volt} = 1 \, \text{joule per coulomb}\).

- **Characteristics**:
  - Electric potential is a scalar quantity.
  - A charge placed at a point with electric potential will have potential energy proportional to the charge and the potential at that point.

### **2. Voltage**

- **Definition**: 
  Voltage is the difference in electric potential between two points. It drives the movement of electric charges in a circuit, analogous to pressure in a water system.

- **Formula**:
  \[
  V = V_A - V_B
  \]
  Where:
  - \(V\): Voltage (potential difference)
  - \(V_A, V_B\): Electric potentials at points \(A\) and \(B\)

- **Units**:
  Also measured in **volts (V)**.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Voltage is the "electric pressure" that pushes charges through a conductor.
  - Voltage determines the energy delivered to or by a charge as it moves between two points:
    \[
    W = q \cdot V
    \]
    Where \(W\) is the work (energy) done in joules.

### **Key Differences**

| **Aspect**         | **Electric Potential**                    | **Voltage (Potential Difference)**       |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | Potential energy per unit charge at a point | Difference in electric potential between two points |
| **Physical Meaning**| Energy available for a charge at a single point | Work done to move a charge between two points |
| **Scalar or Vector**| Scalar                                   | Scalar                                   |

### **Examples in Circuits**

1. **Battery**:
   - A battery creates a voltage by maintaining a potential difference between its terminals.
   - The positive terminal is at a higher potential, while the negative terminal is at a lower potential.

2. **Electric Field**:
   - Charges move naturally from higher potential to lower potential within an electric field, driven by voltage.

---

### **Applications**

1. **Energy Transfer**:
   - Voltage determines how much energy is transferred per charge in devices like motors and heaters.

2. **Circuit Analysis**:
   - Voltage drops across components (e.g., resistors, capacitors) describe energy usage in a circuit.

3. **Signal Processing**:
   - Voltage changes carry information in communication systems.

---

### **Analogy**: 
Think of electric potential like elevation in a landscape:
- A charge at a high potential is like a ball on a hill, ready to roll down.
- Voltage is like the height difference between two points, determining the energy the ball (charge) gains or loses.

Understanding electric potential and voltage allows us to analyze how charges move, how energy is distributed in circuits, and how electrical systems function.
