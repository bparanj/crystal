**Coulomb's Law** mathematically describes the force between two electric charges. It states that:

The magnitude of the electrostatic force (\(F\)) between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (\(r\)) between them.

### **Mathematical Expression**:
\[
F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
\]

Where:
- \(F\): Magnitude of the force between the charges (Newtons, \(N\)).
- \(q_1\), \(q_2\): Magnitudes of the charges (Coulombs, \(C\)).
- \(r\): Distance between the charges (meters, \(m\)).
- \(k\): Coulomb's constant, \(k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{C}^2\).

### **Vector Form**:
The force is a vector quantity, so it also has direction. The vector form of Coulomb's Law is:
\[
\vec{F} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]
Where:
- \(\hat{r}\): Unit vector along the line connecting the charges, indicating the direction of the force.
- The force is **attractive** if \(q_1 q_2 < 0\) (opposite charges) and **repulsive** if \(q_1 q_2 > 0\) (like charges).

### **Characteristics**:

1. **Inverse-Square Relationship**:
   - Doubling the distance (\(r\)) reduces the force by a factor of 4 (\(F \propto 1/r^2\)).

2. **Proportionality to Charges**:
   - Increasing either charge increases the force proportionally (\(F \propto q_1 \cdot q_2\)).

3. **Line of Action**:
   - The force acts along the straight line connecting the centers of the two charges.

### **Applications**:

1. Calculating forces in electrostatic systems.
2. Designing capacitors and other charge-storage devices.
3. Understanding atomic and molecular interactions where electrostatic forces are significant.

Coulomb's Law is fundamental in electrostatics, forming the basis for understanding electric fields, potentials, and forces in electronic and physical systems.
