**Coulomb's Law** tells us how strong the force is between two charged objects. Imagine you have two tiny balls, each with some electric charge. The force between them depends on two things:

1. **The amount of charge** on each ball.
2. **The distance** between the two balls.

- If the charges are bigger, the force is stronger.
- If the balls are closer together, the force is stronger.
- If the charges are smaller or the balls are farther apart, the force is weaker.

Mathematically, Coulomb's Law is written as:
$$
F = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
$$
where:
- \( F \) is the force between the charges.
- \( k_e \) is a constant (you can think of it as a number that makes the units work out right).
- \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) are the amounts of charge on the two objects.
- \( r \) is the distance between the charges.

- **More charge = more force.**
- **Less distance = more force.**

This law helps us understand how charged objects interact, which is super important in electronics for things like capacitors and electric fields.

**Coulomb's Law** mathematically describes the force between two electric charges. It states that:

The magnitude of the electrostatic force (\(F\)) between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (\(r\)) between them.

### **Mathematical Expression**:
\[
F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
\]

Where:
- \(F\): Magnitude of the force between the charges (Newtons, \(N\)).
- \(q_1\), \(q_2\): Magnitudes of the charges (Coulombs, \(C\)).
- \(r\): Distance between the charges (meters, \(m\)).
- \(k\): Coulomb's constant, \(k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{C}^2\).

### **Vector Form**:
The force is a vector quantity, so it also has direction. The vector form of Coulomb's Law is:
\[
\vec{F} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]
Where:
- \(\hat{r}\): Unit vector along the line connecting the charges, indicating the direction of the force.
- The force is **attractive** if \(q_1 q_2 < 0\) (opposite charges) and **repulsive** if \(q_1 q_2 > 0\) (like charges).

### **Characteristics**:

1. **Inverse-Square Relationship**:
   - Doubling the distance (\(r\)) reduces the force by a factor of 4 (\(F \propto 1/r^2\)).

2. **Proportionality to Charges**:
   - Increasing either charge increases the force proportionally (\(F \propto q_1 \cdot q_2\)).

3. **Line of Action**:
   - The force acts along the straight line connecting the centers of the two charges.

### **Applications**:

1. Calculating forces in electrostatic systems.
2. Designing capacitors and other charge-storage devices.
3. Understanding atomic and molecular interactions where electrostatic forces are significant.

Coulomb's Law forms the basis for understanding electric fields, potentials, and forces in electronic and physical systems.
