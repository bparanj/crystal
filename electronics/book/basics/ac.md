### **Demonstrating AC with a Light Bulb**

Demonstrate the alternating nature of AC (Alternating Current) by observing a light bulb's behavior when connected to an AC power source.

### **Components**

1. **AC Power Source** (e.g., a low-voltage AC generator or transformer for safety, such as 12V AC)
2. **Light Bulb** (e.g., a low-voltage incandescent bulb)
3. **Wires** for connections
4. **Multimeter** (optional, to measure AC voltage)

**AC Voltage** alternates its direction and magnitude over time, in contrast to DC (Direct Current), which flows in a single direction. The periodic reversal of current in AC is what powers most household devices and systems.

### **Steps**

#### Step 1:

1. Connect one terminal of the **light bulb** to one terminal of the **AC power source**.
2. Connect the other terminal of the bulb to the other terminal of the power source.

#### Step 2: Observe the Bulb

1. Power the AC source.
2. Observe the light bulb turning on steadily.

#### Step 3: Optional - Measure Voltage

1. Connect a **multimeter** to the AC source in voltage mode.
2. Observe the multimeter displaying the root mean square (RMS) voltage of the AC source.

### **Observation**

- The light bulb glows steadily, indicating that the alternating current is effectively powering it.
- The multimeter shows the voltage value (RMS), not the peak voltage.

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **Alternating Nature of AC:**

   - Though AC current reverses direction periodically, the bulb lights steadily because the filament responds to the power, not the direction of current flow.

2. **RMS Voltage:**

   - The multimeter measures RMS voltage, which is the effective value of AC, showing how AC delivers energy comparable to DC.

3. **Practical Use of AC:**

   - Demonstrates how AC powers devices like light bulbs in real-world applications.

### **Safety Note**

- Use low-voltage AC (e.g., 12V) for safety, especially for beginners.
- Avoid using household AC (120V or 230V) unless under expert supervision.

This experiment is for understanding AC electricity, the dominant form of power transmission and usage in households and industries.
