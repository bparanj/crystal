### **Half-Wave Rectification**

#### **Objective**

Demonstrate how a diode allows current to flow in only one direction by converting an AC signal into a pulsating DC signal through **half-wave rectification**.

### **Components**

1. **AC Power Source** (e.g., 6V or 12V AC)
2. **Diode** (e.g., 1N4007 or any general-purpose diode)
3. **Small Incandescent Bulb** or **LED** with appropriate resistor for current limiting

### **Concept**

A diode acts as a one-way valve for current. In an AC circuit, it allows only the positive half-cycles of the waveform to pass through, effectively blocking the negative half-cycles, creating a pulsating DC output.

### **Steps**

#### Step 1: 

1. Connect one terminal of the AC power source to the **anode** of the diode.
2. Connect the **cathode** of the diode to one terminal of the bulb or LED (with resistor if required).
3. Connect the other terminal of the bulb or LED to the second terminal of the AC power source.

#### Step 2: Run the Experiment

1. Turn on the AC power source.
2. Observe the bulb or LED.

### **Observation**

- The bulb or LED lights up but is noticeably dimmer compared to being connected directly to the AC source. This happens because the diode only allows current to flow during half of the AC cycle (the positive half).
- During the negative half-cycle, the diode blocks current, causing the bulb or LED to remain off.

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **Rectification:**
   - The diode converts AC to pulsating DC by blocking half of the waveform.
2. **Directionality of Current:**
   - The diodeâ€™s behavior shows that current flows only in one direction, a key property of diodes.
3. **Efficiency in Rectification:**
   - Demonstrates the principle behind rectifiers used in power supplies.

### **Applications**

This experiment lays the foundation for understanding rectifiers, a critical component in AC-to-DC conversion used in almost every electronic power supply.
