In electronics, a reactive element is a component that stores and releases energy rather than dissipating it as heat. The two primary types of reactive elements are capacitors and inductors.

### Capacitors
- **Function**: Capacitors store energy in an electric field created between two conductive plates separated by an insulating material (dielectric).
- **Reactance**: The opposition to the change in voltage across the capacitor is called capacitive reactance, denoted as \( X_C \). It is inversely proportional to the frequency of the applied AC signal and the capacitance value:
  $$
  X_C = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}
  $$
  where \( f \) is the frequency and \( C \) is the capacitance.
- **Behavior**: In an AC circuit, capacitors cause the current to lead the voltage by 90 degrees.

### Inductors
- **Function**: Inductors store energy in a magnetic field created by the current flowing through a coil of wire.
- **Reactance**: The opposition to the change in current through the inductor is called inductive reactance, denoted as \( X_L \). It is directly proportional to the frequency of the applied AC signal and the inductance value:
  $$
  X_L = 2 \pi f L
  $$
  where \( f \) is the frequency and \( L \) is the inductance.
- **Behavior**: In an AC circuit, inductors cause the voltage to lead the current by 90 degrees.

- **Energy Storage**: Unlike resistors, which dissipate energy as heat, reactive elements store energy temporarily and release it back into the circuit.
- **Impedance**: The total opposition to AC current flow in a circuit with both resistive and reactive elements is called impedance, denoted as \( Z \). It combines resistance (R) and reactance (X) and is given by:
  $$
  Z = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2}
  $$
- **Applications**: Reactive elements are crucial in various applications, including filtering, tuning circuits, and managing power in AC systems.
