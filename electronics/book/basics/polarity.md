Devices with polarity, such as diodes, LEDs, polarized capacitors, and transistors, are necessary in circuits because they:

1. Control Current Direction:
   - Ensure current flows only in the intended direction, crucial for rectification, signal routing, and protection (e.g., diodes).

2. Enable Specific Functions:
   - Polarized components are designed for specific behaviors, like light emission (LEDs), voltage stabilization (Zener diodes), or energy storage (polarized capacitors).

3. Prevent Damage:
   - Components with polarity protect sensitive parts of the circuit by blocking reverse currents or overvoltage.

4. Improve Efficiency:
   - Properly oriented components optimize energy use and performance in circuits like power supplies, amplifiers, and signal processing systems.

Polarity is useful in achieving directional control in electronic circuits.

### **Demonstrate Polarity**

#### **Objective**

PENDING

This is already demonstrated in 9.md using diode and LED.

Demonstrate the concept of **polarity** and how it affects the functioning of an LED.

### **Components**

1. **Battery** (e.g., 3V coin cell or 9V)
2. **Red LED**

An LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a polarized component. It allows current to flow in only one direction:
- **Forward Bias:** The LED lights up when the **anode** (long leg) is connected to the battery's positive terminal and the **cathode** (short leg) is connected to the negative terminal.
- **Reverse Bias:** The LED does not light up if the connections are reversed because current cannot flow.

### **Steps**

#### Step 1: Connect the LED (Forward Bias)

1. Connect the **anode** (longer leg) of the LED to the **positive terminal** of the battery.
2. Connect the **cathode** (shorter leg) of the LED to the **negative terminal** of the battery.
3. Observe the LED lighting up.

#### Step 2: Reverse the LED (Reverse Bias)

1. Swap the connections:
   - Connect the **anode** to the battery's **negative terminal**.
   - Connect the **cathode** to the battery's **positive terminal**.
2. Observe that the LED does not light up.

### **Observation**

- In **forward bias**, the LED lights up, demonstrating proper current flow.
- In **reverse bias**, the LED remains off, showing that current does not flow through the LED in this configuration.

1. **Polarity:** LEDs are polarized components, and their functionality depends on correct connections.
2. **Direction of Current Flow:** Current flows from the anode to the cathode in forward bias, not in reverse bias.
3. **Practicality of Polarity:** Understanding polarity is critical when designing circuits with diodes, LEDs, and other polarized components.

This experiment introduces the basic concept of polarity in electronics.
