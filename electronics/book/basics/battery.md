### **Voltage as Electrical Potential**

#### **Objective**

Demonstrate the concept of **voltage** as the driving force behind the flow of current in a circuit.

### **Components**

1. **Battery** (e.g., 9V or AA cell)
2. **Multimeter** (to measure voltage)
3. **Two metal wires** (or jumper wires)

### **Concept**

**Voltage** is the measure of electrical potential difference between two points. A battery creates this potential difference, which drives the flow of current in a circuit.

### **Steps**

#### Step 1: Measure Voltage

1. Set the **multimeter** to the **voltage (V)** setting.
2. Place the **positive probe** of the multimeter on the **positive terminal** of the battery.
3. Place the **negative probe** on the **negative terminal** of the battery.
4. Observe the voltage reading (e.g., 9V for a 9V battery).

#### Step 2: Connect Wires and Observe

1. Connect one metal wire to the **positive terminal** and another wire to the **negative terminal** of the battery.
2. Observe no current flow because the wires are not connected (open circuit).

#### Step 3: Complete the Circuit

1. Briefly touch the free ends of the wires together to complete the circuit.
2. Feel a slight heat at the contact point, demonstrating energy transfer.

### **Observation**

1. The **multimeter reading** shows the battery's voltage, which represents the potential difference.
2. When the wires are connected, energy is released as heat, demonstrating the flow of current caused by the voltage.

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **Voltage as Potential Difference:**
   - The multimeter reading shows the energy per unit charge the battery can deliver.
2. **Open vs. Closed Circuit:**
   - Current flows only when there is a closed circuit (wires connected).
3. **Energy Transformation:**
   - The heat at the connection point shows electrical energy transforming into thermal energy.

### **Variations**

1. Use batteries of different voltages (e.g., 1.5V, 9V) to show how the potential difference changes.
2. Connect a low-resistance load, like a small resistor or an LED, to see visible energy transfer.

This simple experiment introduces voltage, the foundation of all electrical systems, and highlights how batteries serve as a source of energy in circuits.
