To determine the **efficiency** of an electrical device, you need to compare the useful output power (or energy) to the input power (or energy). Efficiency is expressed as a percentage and quantifies how effectively the device converts input energy into useful output.

---

### **Formula for Efficiency**
\[
\text{Efficiency} (\eta) = \frac{\text{Useful Output Power}}{\text{Input Power}} \times 100
\]

Where:
- \(\eta\): Efficiency (in percentage, \(%\)).
- **Useful Output Power**: The power delivered to the desired load or application.
- **Input Power**: The total power supplied to the device.

---

### **Calculate Efficiency**
1. **Measure Input Power (\(P_{\text{in}}\))**:
   - Use the formula:
     \[
     P_{\text{in}} = V_{\text{in}} \cdot I_{\text{in}}
     \]
   - \(V_{\text{in}}\): Input voltage (in volts, \(V\)).
   - \(I_{\text{in}}\): Input current (in amperes, \(A\)).

2. **Measure Useful Output Power (\(P_{\text{out}}\))**:
   - For electrical output:
     \[
     P_{\text{out}} = V_{\text{out}} \cdot I_{\text{out}}
     \]
   - For mechanical output (e.g., motors), calculate power based on the type of work:
     \[
     P_{\text{out}} = F \cdot v \quad \text{(for force and velocity)} \quad \text{or} \quad P_{\text{out}} = T \cdot \omega \quad \text{(for torque and angular velocity)}.
     \]

3. **Substitute into Efficiency Formula**:
   \[
   \eta = \frac{P_{\text{out}}}{P_{\text{in}}} \times 100
   \]

---

### **Example**
**Determine the efficiency of a motor:**
- Input power: \(V_{\text{in}} = 240 \, \text{V}\), \(I_{\text{in}} = 10 \, \text{A}\)
  \[
  P_{\text{in}} = V_{\text{in}} \cdot I_{\text{in}} = 240 \cdot 10 = 2,400 \, \text{W}.
  \]
- Output power: Measured mechanical output is \(P_{\text{out}} = 2,000 \, \text{W}\).

Efficiency:
\[
\eta = \frac{P_{\text{out}}}{P_{\text{in}}} \times 100 = \frac{2,000}{2,400} \times 100 = 83.33\%.
\]

---

### **Considerations**
1. **Energy Efficiency**:
   - If measuring over time, use energy values:
     \[
     \eta = \frac{\text{Useful Output Energy}}{\text{Input Energy}} \times 100
     \]
     Energy is measured in joules (\(J\)) or kilowatt-hours (\(kWh\)).

2. **Losses**:
   - Inefficiency arises due to energy losses in the form of heat, sound, or vibration.
   - Example: Heat loss in resistors, friction in motors.

3. **Real-World Devices**:
   - **Typical Efficiencies**:
     - Motors: 70–95%
     - Light bulbs: 5–15% (traditional incandescent) or 80–90% (LEDs)
     - Power supplies: 85–95%

---

### **Improving Efficiency**
- Reduce losses (e.g., use better insulation, reduce friction).
- Match the device to the load for optimal operation.
- Use high-efficiency components (e.g., transformers, LEDs).

---

### **Summary**
Efficiency measures how effectively a device converts input power to useful output power. It helps assess performance, identify energy losses, and optimize system design.
