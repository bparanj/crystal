The **principle of electric charge** forms the foundation of electromagnetism and electronics. It describes the nature, behavior, and interaction of electric charges, which are intrinsic properties of matter.

---

- Electric charge is a fundamental property of particles that determines their electromagnetic interactions.
- It is measured in **coulombs (C)**.
- Charges come in two types:
  1. **Positive charge**: Found in protons.
  2. **Negative charge**: Found in electrons.

### **Basic Principles**

1. **Opposite Charges Attract, Like Charges Repel**:
   - **Attraction**: Positive and negative charges pull toward each other.
   - **Repulsion**: Positive-positive or negative-negative charges push away from each other.
   - This is described by **Coulomb's law**, which quantifies the force between charges:
     \[
     F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
     \]
     - \(F\): Force between the charges.
     - \(q_1, q_2\): Magnitudes of the charges.
     - \(r\): Distance between the charges.
     - \(k\): Coulomb's constant (\(8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{C}^2\)).

2. **Conservation of Charge**:
   - Electric charge cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred from one object to another.
   - Total charge in an isolated system remains constant.

3. **Quantization of Charge**:
   - Electric charge exists in discrete packets, always as integer multiples of the elementary charge (\(e\)):
     \[
     q = n \cdot e
     \]
     - \(e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\) (charge of a single proton or electron).
     - \(n\): Integer representing the number of charges.

4. **Charge Transfer**:
   - Charges can be transferred between objects through:
     - **Friction**: Rubbing two materials transfers electrons.
     - **Conduction**: Direct contact transfers charge between conductors.
     - **Induction**: A nearby charged object induces charge separation without direct contact.

5. **Electric Field**:
   - Charges produce an electric field around them, influencing other charges in the vicinity.
   - The electric field (\(E\)) at a point is defined as the force (\(F\)) per unit charge (\(q\)):
     \[
     E = \frac{F}{q}
     \]
   - Direction: Away from positive charges and toward negative charges.

### **Applications**

1. **Electrostatics**:
   - Understanding static electricity and charge behavior at rest.

2. **Current Electricity**:
   - Electric charge in motion constitutes **electric current**, vital for powering circuits.

3. **Capacitance**:
   - The storage of electric charge in devices like capacitors.

4. **Electromagnetism**:
   - Moving charges generate magnetic fields, essential in motors and generators.

5. **Electronics**:
   - Charge flow and interaction underpin all electronic devices and circuits.

- Electric charge governs fundamental interactions in nature, from atomic bonding to macroscopic forces.
- Its conservation and quantization make it a predictable and measurable property.
- By understanding charge behavior, engineers and scientists design circuits, devices, and technologies that drive modern life.
