### **Inductive Reactance**

#### **Objective**

Demonstrate the property of **inductive reactance**, showing how an inductor resists changes in current in an AC circuit.

### **Components**

1. **AC Power Source** (e.g., 6V or 12V AC)
2. **Inductor** (e.g., 10 mH)
3. **Small Incandescent Bulb** (e.g., 6V rating)

### **Concept**

An inductor resists changes in current by developing a voltage (back EMF) opposing the change. In AC circuits, this resistance to current is called **inductive reactance** (\(X_L\)), which depends on the frequency of the AC signal:
\[
X_L = 2 \pi f L
\]
Where:
- \(f\) is the frequency of the AC source
- \(L\) is the inductance in henries (H)

### **Steps**

#### Step 1: Assemble the Circuit

1. Connect one terminal of the AC power source to one terminal of the inductor.
2. Connect the other terminal of the inductor to one terminal of the incandescent bulb.
3. Complete the circuit by connecting the other terminal of the bulb to the AC power source.

#### Step 2: Run the Experiment

1. Power the circuit with the AC source.
2. Observe the brightness of the bulb.

### **Observation**

- The brightness of the bulb decreases as the frequency of the AC increases because the inductor's reactance (\(X_L\)) increases, limiting current flow.
- At low frequencies, the bulb glows brighter due to lower reactance.

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **Inductive Reactance:**
   - The inductor opposes the AC current more strongly as the frequency increases.
2. **Frequency Dependence:**
   - The resistance to current (reactance) increases with higher frequencies.

This experiment directly demonstrates the frequency-dependent behavior of an inductor in an AC circuit with minimal components, emphasizing its fundamental role in opposing current changes.
