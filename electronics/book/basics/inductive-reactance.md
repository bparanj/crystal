A simple experiment to demonstrate reactance in an inductor using Tinkercad involves creating an AC circuit with an inductor and observing how the inductor affects the current and voltage. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Components:

- Breadboard
- AC power source (e.g., function generator)
- Inductor (e.g., 100 mH)
- Resistor (e.g., 1 kÎ©)
- Wires
- Multimeter (to measure voltage and current)

### Steps:

   - Place the resistor and inductor in series on the breadboard.
   - Connect the AC power source to the series combination of the resistor and inductor.
   - Connect the multimeter in series to measure the current and in parallel across the inductor to measure the voltage.

   - Configure the AC power source to a specific frequency (e.g., 50 Hz or 60 Hz).
   - Run the simulation and observe the voltage across the inductor and the current through the circuit.

### Observations:

- **Voltage and Current Phase Difference**: You will notice that the voltage across the inductor and the current through the circuit are not in phase. The voltage leads the current in an inductive circuit.
- **Reactance**: The inductive reactance (\(X_L\)) can be calculated using the formula \(X_L = 2\pi fL\), where \(f\) is the frequency of the AC source and \(L\) is the inductance. This reactance affects the amplitude of the current and voltage.

### Explanation:

- **Inductive Reactance**: Reactance is the opposition that an inductor offers to the flow of AC current. It depends on the frequency of the AC signal and the inductance. Higher frequencies result in higher reactance, reducing the current flow.
- **Phase Difference**: In a purely inductive circuit, the voltage leads the current by 90 degrees. This phase difference is a key characteristic of inductive reactance.

### Using Tinkercad:

1. **Create the Circuit**: Use the Tinkercad interface to place the components on the virtual breadboard.
2. **Simulate**: Run the simulation to observe the phase difference and the effect of reactance. Use the virtual multimeter to measure the voltage and current.

This experiment helps visualize how inductors behave in AC circuits and demonstrates the concept of reactance effectively.

Demonstrate the property of **inductive reactance**, showing how an inductor resists changes in current in an AC circuit.

### **Components**

1. **AC Power Source** (e.g., 6V or 12V AC)
2. **Inductor** (e.g., 10 mH)
3. **Small Incandescent Bulb** (e.g., 6V rating)

### **Concept**

An inductor resists changes in current by developing a voltage (back EMF) opposing the change. In AC circuits, this resistance to current is called **inductive reactance** (\(X_L\)), which depends on the frequency of the AC signal:
\[
X_L = 2 \pi f L
\]
Where:
- \(f\) is the frequency of the AC source
- \(L\) is the inductance in henries (H)

### **Steps**

#### Step 1:

1. Connect one terminal of the AC power source to one terminal of the inductor.
2. Connect the other terminal of the inductor to one terminal of the incandescent bulb.
3. Complete the circuit by connecting the other terminal of the bulb to the AC power source.

#### Step 2:

1. Power the circuit with the AC source.
2. Observe the brightness of the bulb.

### **Observation**

- The brightness of the bulb decreases as the frequency of the AC increases because the inductor's reactance (\(X_L\)) increases, limiting current flow.
- At low frequencies, the bulb glows brighter due to lower reactance.

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **Inductive Reactance:**
   - The inductor opposes the AC current more strongly as the frequency increases.
2. **Frequency Dependence:**
   - The resistance to current (reactance) increases with higher frequencies.

This experiment demonstrates the frequency-dependent behavior of an inductor in an AC circuit and shows how it opposes current changes.
