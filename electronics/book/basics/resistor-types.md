Resistors come in various types based on material, construction, and application.

### **1. Fixed Resistors**
These have a constant resistance value that cannot be adjusted.

1. **Carbon Composition Resistors**:
   - Made of carbon particles mixed with a binding material.
   - Used in general-purpose applications.
   - Example: Legacy electronics.

2. **Carbon Film Resistors**:
   - A carbon layer deposited on a ceramic core.
   - Provide better stability and lower noise than carbon composition resistors.
   - Example: Audio equipment.

3. **Metal Film Resistors**:
   - A thin metal film deposited on a ceramic rod.
   - Offer high accuracy, low noise, and temperature stability.
   - Example: Precision instruments.

4. **Metal Oxide Resistors**:
   - Made of metal oxides, offering better heat resistance than metal film resistors.
   - Example: High-temperature circuits.

5. **Wirewound Resistors**:
   - Resistive wire wound around a ceramic core.
   - High power-handling capacity, but bulky.
   - Example: Power supplies, motor controllers.

6. **Thick Film and Thin Film Resistors**:
   - Thick film: Made by screen-printing a resistive layer.
   - Thin film: A thin layer of resistive material on a substrate.
   - Example: Integrated circuits, high-frequency circuits.

7. **Chip Resistors**:
   - Surface-mount resistors (SMT) for compact circuit designs.
   - Example: Modern PCBs.

### **2. Variable Resistors**
These allow manual adjustment of resistance.

1. **Potentiometers**:
   - A three-terminal device used to vary voltage.
   - Example: Volume controls in audio devices.

2. **Rheostats**:
   - A two-terminal variable resistor used to control current.
   - Example: Light dimmers, fan speed controls.

3. **Trimmers**:
   - Small, adjustable resistors used for calibration or fine-tuning.
   - Example: Tuning circuits in radios.

### **3. Special Purpose Resistors**
Designed for specific applications or environmental conditions.

1. **Thermistors**:
   - Temperature-sensitive resistors.
   - Types:
     - **NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient)**: Resistance decreases with temperature.
     - **PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient)**: Resistance increases with temperature.
   - Example: Temperature sensors.

2. **Light-Dependent Resistors (LDRs)**:
   - Resistance changes with light intensity.
   - Example: Automatic streetlights, light meters.

3. **Varistors (VDRs)**:
   - Voltage-dependent resistors that protect circuits from voltage spikes.
   - Example: Surge protectors.

4. **Fusible Resistors**:
   - Double as a resistor and a fuse, breaking the circuit under excessive current.
   - Example: Power supply protection.

5. **Precision Resistors**:
   - Offer extremely accurate resistance values (low tolerance, e.g., 0.1%).
   - Example: Measurement devices.

6. **High Power Resistors**:
   - Designed to dissipate large amounts of power without damage.
   - Example: Motor control circuits.

7. **Zero Ohm Resistors**:
   - Essentially a wire link packaged as a resistor for PCB routing.
   - Example: Circuit jumpers.

### **4. Integrated Resistors**
Resistors integrated into larger devices or systems.

1. **Resistor Arrays**:
   - Multiple resistors in a single package.
   - Example: Digital circuits.

2. **Resistors in ICs**:
   - Built directly into integrated circuits.
   - Example: Microprocessors, amplifiers.

The choice of resistor depends on the application requirements, including resistance value, tolerance, power rating, and environmental conditions.
