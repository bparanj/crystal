In electronics, several basic units of measurement are used to quantify electrical properties and describe circuit behavior. Below are the key units and their definitions:

---

### **1. Charge (Coulomb, C)**
   - **Definition**: The amount of electric charge carried by a particle or a group of particles.
   - **Unit**: Coulomb (C)
   - **Relation**: 1 Coulomb = the charge transported by a current of 1 ampere in 1 second.

---

### **2. Current (Ampere, A)**
   - **Definition**: The rate of flow of electric charge through a conductor.
   - **Unit**: Ampere (A)
   - **Formula**: \( I = \frac{Q}{t} \), where \( Q \) is charge in coulombs, \( t \) is time in seconds.

---

### **3. Voltage (Volt, V)**
   - **Definition**: The electric potential difference between two points in a circuit, which drives the flow of current.
   - **Unit**: Volt (V)
   - **Formula**: \( V = IR \), where \( I \) is current in amperes, \( R \) is resistance in ohms.

---

### **4. Resistance (Ohm, Ω)**
   - **Definition**: The opposition to the flow of electric current in a material.
   - **Unit**: Ohm (Ω)
   - **Formula**: \( R = \frac{V}{I} \), where \( V \) is voltage, \( I \) is current.

---

### **5. Power (Watt, W)**
   - **Definition**: The rate at which electrical energy is consumed or generated.
   - **Unit**: Watt (W)
   - **Formula**: \( P = VI \), where \( V \) is voltage, \( I \) is current.

---

### **6. Capacitance (Farad, F)**
   - **Definition**: The ability of a component (capacitor) to store electrical charge.
   - **Unit**: Farad (F)
   - **Formula**: \( C = \frac{Q}{V} \), where \( Q \) is charge, \( V \) is voltage.

---

### **7. Inductance (Henry, H)**
   - **Definition**: The property of a component (inductor) that opposes a change in current.
   - **Unit**: Henry (H)
   - **Formula**: \( V = L \frac{dI}{dt} \), where \( L \) is inductance, \( \frac{dI}{dt} \) is the rate of change of current.

---

### **8. Frequency (Hertz, Hz)**
   - **Definition**: The number of cycles of a periodic signal per second.
   - **Unit**: Hertz (Hz)
   - **Formula**: \( f = \frac{1}{T} \), where \( T \) is the period in seconds.

---

### **9. Conductance (Siemens, S)**
   - **Definition**: The measure of a material's ability to conduct electric current (reciprocal of resistance).
   - **Unit**: Siemens (S)
   - **Formula**: \( G = \frac{1}{R} \), where \( R \) is resistance in ohms.

---

### **10. Magnetic Flux (Weber, Wb)**
   - **Definition**: The total magnetic field passing through a surface.
   - **Unit**: Weber (Wb)
   - **Formula**: \( \Phi = B \cdot A \), where \( B \) is magnetic flux density, \( A \) is area.

---

### **11. Magnetic Flux Density (Tesla, T)**
   - **Definition**: The amount of magnetic flux per unit area.
   - **Unit**: Tesla (T)
   - **Formula**: \( B = \frac{\Phi}{A} \), where \( \Phi \) is magnetic flux, \( A \) is area.

---

### **12. Energy (Joule, J)**
   - **Definition**: The work done or energy transferred in a circuit.
   - **Unit**: Joule (J)
   - **Formula**: \( E = P \cdot t \), where \( P \) is power in watts, \( t \) is time in seconds.
