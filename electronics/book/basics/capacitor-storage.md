### **Energy Storage in Capacitor**

#### **Objective**

Demonstrate how a capacitor stores and releases energy by observing its charging and discharging behavior.

### **Components**

1. **Battery** (e.g., 9V or 3V coin cell)
2. **Electrolytic Capacitor** (e.g., 1000 ÂµF, 16V)
3. **LED**
4. **Jumper Wires** (optional for neat connections)

### **Concept**

A capacitor temporarily stores energy in the form of an electric field and can release it when needed. This experiment shows:
- How a capacitor charges from a power source.
- How it discharges and powers an LED when disconnected from the battery.

### **Steps**

#### Step 1: Charge the Capacitor

1. Connect the **positive terminal** of the capacitor to the **positive terminal** of the battery.
2. Connect the **negative terminal** of the capacitor to the **negative terminal** of the battery.
3. Allow the capacitor to charge for a few seconds.

#### Step 2: Disconnect the Battery

1. Remove the battery from the circuit while keeping the capacitor connected to the circuit.

#### Step 3: Discharge the Capacitor Through the LED

1. Connect the **anode** (longer leg) of the LED to the **positive terminal** of the capacitor.
2. Connect the **cathode** (shorter leg) of the LED to the **negative terminal** of the capacitor.
3. Observe the LED lighting up briefly as the capacitor discharges.

### **Observation**

- The LED lights up momentarily, then dims and turns off as the capacitor discharges.
- The duration of the LED's light depends on the capacitor's capacitance and the current drawn by the LED.

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **Energy Storage and Release:**
   - The capacitor stores energy when connected to the battery.
   - It releases this stored energy when connected to the LED.
   
2. **Charging and Discharging:**
   - Capacitors take a finite time to charge and discharge, depending on their capacitance and the circuit's resistance.

3. **Temporary Power Supply:**
   - The capacitor acts as a temporary power source, lighting the LED briefly even after the battery is removed.

This simple experiment introduces the core functionality of capacitors as energy storage components in electronic circuits.
