**Power** is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred in a system. It quantifies how quickly energy is converted from one form to another or how fast work is performed.

---

### **Mathematical Definition**
\[
P = \frac{W}{t}
\]
Where:
- \(P\): Power (in watts, \(W\)).
- \(W\): Work done or energy transferred (in joules, \(J\)).
- \(t\): Time taken (in seconds, \(s\)).

---

### **SI Unit**
- The SI unit of power is the **watt (W)**:
  \[
  1 \, \text{Watt} = 1 \, \text{joule per second (J/s)}.
  \]

---

### **Alternative Expressions**
1. **In terms of Force and Velocity**:
   If a force (\(F\)) moves an object with velocity (\(v\)):
   \[
   P = F \cdot v
   \]

2. **In Electrical Systems**:
   For an electrical circuit:
   \[
   P = V \cdot I
   \]
   Where:
   - \(V\): Voltage (in volts, \(V\)).
   - \(I\): Current (in amperes, \(A\)).

---

### **Types of Power**
1. **Mechanical Power**:
   - Associated with mechanical systems (e.g., engines, turbines).
   - Formula: \(P = \frac{\text{Work}}{\text{Time}}\).

2. **Electrical Power**:
   - Associated with electrical circuits and systems.
   - Formula: \(P = V \cdot I\).

3. **Thermal Power**:
   - Associated with heat transfer (e.g., heaters, radiators).

---

### **Concepts**
1. **Instantaneous Power**:
   - The power at a specific moment in time.
   - Given by:
     \[
     P = \frac{dW}{dt}
     \]

2. **Average Power**:
   - The total work done divided by the total time taken.

---

### **Applications**
1. **Electrical Devices**:
   - Measuring the power consumption of devices (e.g., light bulbs, motors).
2. **Mechanical Systems**:
   - Calculating engine or turbine output.
3. **Energy Efficiency**:
   - Assessing energy transfer rates to optimize performance.

---

### **Examples**
1. **Mechanical Power**:
   - A 100N force moves a box 10m in 5 seconds:
     \[
     W = F \cdot d = 100 \cdot 10 = 1,000 \, \text{J}
     \]
     \[
     P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{1,000}{5} = 200 \, \text{W}
     \]

2. **Electrical Power**:
   - A 12V battery delivers a 2A current:
     \[
     P = V \cdot I = 12 \cdot 2 = 24 \, \text{W}
     \]

---

### **Summary**
Power is a measure of how quickly energy is used, produced, or transferred in a system. It provides insight into the efficiency and performance of machines, devices, and processes.
