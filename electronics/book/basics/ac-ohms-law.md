### **Demonstrate Ohm's Law with AC**

#### **Objective**

Demonstrate **Ohm's Law** in an AC circuit by measuring the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.

### **Components**

1. **AC Power Source** (e.g., 12V AC)
2. **Resistor** (e.g., \( 1 \, \text{k}\Omega \))
3. **Multimeter** (to measure AC voltage and current)

Ohm's Law applies to AC circuits as well as DC circuits:
\[
V = I \times R
\]
Where:
- \( V \) is the RMS voltage across the resistor.
- \( I \) is the RMS current through the resistor.
- \( R \) is the resistance.

### **Steps**

#### Step 1:

1. Connect one terminal of the **resistor** to one terminal of the **AC power source**.
2. Connect the other terminal of the resistor to the other terminal of the power source.

#### Step 2: Measure Voltage

1. Set the **multimeter** to AC voltage mode.
2. Place the probes across the **resistor**.
3. Record the voltage reading.

#### Step 3: Measure Current

1. Set the **multimeter** to AC current mode.
2. Break the circuit and insert the multimeter in series with the resistor.
3. Record the current reading.

#### Step 4: Verify Ohm’s Law

1. Using the formula:
   \[
   I = \frac{V}{R}
   \]
   Calculate the expected current from the measured voltage and the known resistance.
2. Compare this calculated current to the multimeter reading.

### **Observation**

The measured current matches the calculated current from Ohm's Law, showing the linear relationship between voltage and current in an AC circuit with a resistor.

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **Ohm’s Law with AC:**
   - The relationship between voltage, current, and resistance is valid for AC circuits.
2. **RMS Values:**
   - The multimeter measures RMS (Root Mean Square) values, which are equivalent to DC values in terms of power delivery.
3. **Resistor Behavior in AC:**
   - A resistor behaves the same way in AC as in DC, with no phase shift between voltage and current.

### **Applications**

- Understanding the basic behavior of resistors in AC circuits is fundamental for analyzing more complex circuits with inductors or capacitors.

This experiment is simple yet foundational for introducing AC circuit behavior and verifying the universal application of Ohm's Law.
