If the output waveform is a flat line in the middle of the oscilloscope display across the resistor, it suggests that the output voltage is near zero or the signal is being attenuated entirely. Here's why this might happen and how to fix it:

### Possible Causes

1. Frequency Too Low:
   - At low frequencies (below the cutoff frequency), a high-pass filter blocks most of the input signal. This would result in little to no voltage across the resistor, appearing as a flat line.

2. Capacitor Value Too High:
   - If the capacitor's value is too large, the cutoff frequency (\(f_c\)) becomes very low. This causes the filter to block frequencies close to or above the input frequency, leading to minimal output.

3. Incorrect Connections:
   - Ensure the resistor is connected properly across the correct output terminals, and the capacitor is in series with the resistor.

4. Oscilloscope Settings:
   - The oscilloscope's time per division or voltage scale may not be set correctly, making small signals appear as a flat line.

### Steps to Troubleshoot and Fix

1. Increase Input Frequency:
   - Gradually increase the frequency from 10 Hz upward toward and beyond the cutoff frequency (\(f_c\)).
   - For the given values (\(R = 10 \, \text{k}\Omega, C = 0.1 \, \mu\text{F}\)), \(f_c \approx 159 \, \text{Hz}\). Signals below this frequency will be attenuated significantly.

2. Check Oscilloscope Settings:
   - Adjust the voltage scale on the output oscilloscope to a smaller range (e.g., \(1 \, \text{mV/div}\)) to detect smaller signals.
   - Ensure the time per division is appropriate for the signal frequency (e.g., \(10 \, \text{ms/div}\) for \(f = 100 \, \text{Hz}\)).

3. Verify Component Connections:
   - Confirm the capacitor is in series with the resistor.
   - Ensure the resistor is connected across the oscilloscope probes.

4. Test Higher Frequencies:
   - If increasing the frequency results in a sine wave appearing on the output oscilloscope, the filter is working as expected.

### Expected Behavior

- Below 159 Hz: Output appears flat (no voltage across the resistor).
- Around 159 Hz: Output voltage starts increasing, with some attenuation and phase shift.
- Above 159 Hz: Output closely follows the input sine wave.

The difference in the scales of the input and output signals indicates that the RC high-pass filter is attenuating the input signal at 100 Hz, which is below the filter's cutoff frequency (\(f_c\)). Here's what it means:

### Observations

1. Input Signal:
   - The input oscilloscope shows a 10 V scale sine wave, which means the input signal has a peak-to-peak amplitude of 10 V.

2. Output Signal:
   - The output oscilloscope shows a 4 V scale sine wave, meaning the output signal has been attenuated to 4 V peak-to-peak.

3. Attenuation Below Cutoff Frequency:
   - At 100 Hz, which is below the cutoff frequency of \(f_c = 159 \, \text{Hz}\) (calculated earlier for \(R = 10 \, \text{k}\Omega\) and \(C = 0.1 \, \mu\text{F}\)), the high-pass filter attenuates lower frequencies. The observed reduction in output voltage aligns with this behavior.

### What This Means

- The RC high-pass filter is performing as expected:
  - Low Frequencies (\(f < f_c\)): Signals are attenuated.
  - High Frequencies (\(f > f_c\)): Signals pass with minimal attenuation.

At 100 Hz:

- The output amplitude is lower because the signal frequency is below the cutoff, where the capacitor offers higher impedance, limiting current flow through the resistor and reducing the voltage across it.

The observed output signal at 4 V peak-to-peak confirms that the filter is attenuating low-frequency components as designed. If you increase the input frequency closer to or above \(f_c = 159 \, \text{Hz}\), the output signal amplitude will increase and eventually match the input signal at higher frequencies.

At 1 kHz, the input and output waveforms being the same and on the same scale indicates that the signal frequency is well above the cutoff frequency (\(f_c = 159 \, \text{Hz}\)). The high-pass filter allows high-frequency signals to pass with minimal attenuation, showing the filter's expected behavior.
