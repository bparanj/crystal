### Demonstrate Capacitor Passing AC Signal

This experiment shows how a capacitor allows AC signals to pass through the circuit but blocks DC signals.

### Components

1. Function Generator
2. LED (any color)
3. Capacitor: 100 µF (non-polarized is ideal, but polarized can be used with correct polarity)
4. Resistor: 330 Ω (to protect the LED)
5. Breadboard
6. Wires

### Steps

1. Connect the Function Generator:
   - Place the function generator on the breadboard.
   - Connect its positive terminal to one side of the capacitor.
   - Connect its negative terminal to the negative rail of the breadboard.

2. Connect the Capacitor:
   - Connect the other side of the capacitor to one terminal of the resistor.

3. Connect the LED:
   - Connect the other terminal of the resistor to the anode (long leg) of the LED.
   - Connect the cathode (short leg) of the LED to the negative rail of the breadboard.

4. Power Supply Connection:
   - The function generator acts as the signal source, so no external DC power supply is needed.

### Function Generator Configuration

1. Set the function generator to:
   - Waveform: Sine wave.
   - Frequency: 1 kHz (or a similar low frequency for easier observation).
   - Amplitude: 5V peak-to-peak.
   - DC Offset: 0V (pure AC signal).

### Procedure

1. Observe the LED Behavior:
   - Run the simulation in Tinkercad.
   - The LED will blink rapidly or appear dim, as the AC signal passes through the capacitor.

2. Experiment with DC Offset:
   - Change the DC offset of the function generator to a positive value (e.g., 2V).
   - Observe how the LED lights up continuously because the capacitor now passes the AC signal combined with the DC offset.

3. Remove the AC Component:
   - Set the function generator to output only DC (remove the AC component).
   - Observe that the LED turns off, showing that the capacitor blocks pure DC signals.


- The capacitor blocks DC and allows AC to pass by continuously charging and discharging in response to the alternating voltage. The LED lights up when the capacitor passes the AC signal but remains off for pure DC. 

This experiment demonstrates the AC-coupling property of a capacitor.

The LED is bright initially and then becomes dim because the capacitor charges over time, reducing the current flow through the circuit. Here’s why this happens:

1. Initial State:
   - When the circuit starts, the capacitor is uncharged, and it acts like a short circuit for the AC signal.
   - A high current flows through the circuit, lighting the LED brightly.

2. Charging Phase:
   - As the capacitor charges, it develops a voltage across its plates, opposing the flow of current.
   - Over time, the capacitor reaches a steady-state charge for the applied signal, reducing the effective current passing through the LED.

3. Steady State:
   - Once the capacitor is fully charged for DC components (or at equilibrium for AC signals), it blocks further DC current while allowing only the AC component of the signal to pass.
   - The reduced current through the LED makes it appear dimmer.

### Factors

- Capacitor Size: Larger capacitance takes longer to charge but can smooth out the signal more effectively.
- Frequency of Signal: At lower frequencies, the capacitor charges and discharges more slowly, affecting the LED's brightness.

### How to Observe Pure AC Behavior

To keep the LED brightness consistent:
- Ensure the signal is purely AC (set the function generator's DC offset to 0V).
- Use a smaller capacitor value (e.g., 10 µF) to reduce the charging time and focus on the AC response.

This behavior demonstrates the charging and discharging dynamics of the capacitor and its role in filtering DC components while passing AC.
