How do capacitors operate as passive components?

PENDING

Merge with existing experiment.

Capacitors store electrical energy in an electric field. They block DC current while allowing AC current to flow, with their capacitance measured in farads (F).

Charging Phase

1. Close the circuit by connecting the positive rail to the LED-resistor-capacitor circuit.
2. The capacitor will start charging, causing the LED to light up initially and then gradually dim as the capacitor charges fully.
3. Observe the LED: It will light up brightly at first and then slowly dim as the capacitor reaches its full charge and current flow reduces.

Discharging Phase

1. Disconnect the battery from the circuit, leaving the capacitor, LED, and resistor connected.
2. The capacitor will now discharge through the LED, causing the LED to briefly light up again, then fade as the capacitor releases its stored charge.

The capacitor stores charge when the battery is connected. The LED’s brightness initially shows this charging process. When the battery is removed, the capacitor discharges through the LED, briefly lighting it up until the stored energy is depleted.

Polarized Capacitor

PENDING

In polarized capacitor experiment, add a photo of capacitor to show that longer leg is positive and shorter leg is negative. Real photo is needed for this image.

Steps

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Take a slideswitch. It is connected to h7, h8 and h9.

Step 5

The first terminal of the slideswitch is the Terminal 1.

Step 6

The middle terminal of the slideswitch is the Common.

Step 7

The last terminal of the slideswitch is the Terminal 2.

Step 8

Connect the Common terminal of the slideswitch to the postive terminal of the breadboard. The red wire connects from j8 to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 9

Take a resistor with value 1 k ohm. Connect one end of the resistor to the terminal 2 of the slideswitch. One end of the resistor connects to f9, the other end of the resistor is connected to d9 of the breadboard.

Step 10

Take a red LED and connect the Anode to a9 and Cathode to a8 in the breadboard.

Image 12

Step 11

Connect the Cathode of the LED to the negative terminal of the breadboard. This is the connection from a8 to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Image 13

Step 12

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Image 14

Step 13

Run the simulation. The LED turns on when the slideswitch is on.

Image 15

Step 14

The LED turns off when the slideswitch is off.

Image 16

We now have a working circuit. We will extend this experiment so that when we turn off the slideswitch the capacitor will provide power to the LED.

Step 15

Take a polarized capacitor with value: 1000 micro Farad, 16 volt. Connect it to f2 and f4 in the breadboard.

Image 17

Step 16

Connect the first terminal of the polarized capacitor to the ground.

Image 18

The first terminal is the negative terminal of the capacitor. The polarized capacitor has polarity.

Image 19

The connection starts from f2 and ends at the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 17

The other terminal of the polarized capacitor is the positive terminal.

Image 20

Connect the positive terminal of the polarized capacitor to the resistor (f9 in the breadboard). This creates a parallel path for the capacitor to work when the switch is turned off. See the circuit diagram. Change the internal wire color from red to green. Retake the screenshot and update image 21.

Image 21

Step 18

Run the simulation. Turn the slideswitch switch to ON position. The LED turns ON.

Image 22.

Step 19

Turn the slideswitch to OFF position. The LED dims from it full brightness as the capacitor discharges.

Image 23
Image 24

Step 20

Finally it turns off after a few seconds. The LED brightness indicates the amount of current flow. This demonstrates the capacitor's ability to store and release energy without generating it.

Show the big leg and small leg and how it is positive and negative of the Capacitor.

A slide switch is used to control the flow of current from the battery to the LED. When the switch is on, the LED lights up directly from the battery. When off, the circuit opens, stopping the direct current flow.

By adding a capacitor in parallel with the LED and resistor, the capacitor charges up when the switch is on. When the switch is turned off, the capacitor gradually discharges, providing temporary current to the LED. This demonstrates the capacitor’s ability to store and release energy.

After turning off the switch, the LED dims gradually as the capacitor discharges. This shows the typical discharge curve of a capacitor, where the voltage and brightness decrease over time until the stored energy is depleted.

The experiment uses a polarized capacitor, where the correct polarity is essential. The capacitor's positive terminal is connected to the circuit, and its negative terminal is grounded.
