Steps

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Image 1

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery. 

Image 2

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Image 3

Step 4

Take a slideswitch. It is connected to h7,h8 and h9.

Image 4

Step 5

The first terminal of the slideswitch is the Terminal 1.

Image 5

Step 6

The middle terminal of the slideswitch is the Common.

Step 7

The last terminal of the slideswitch is the Terminal 2.

Image 7

Step 8

Connect the Common terminal of the slideswitch to the postive terminal of the breadboard. The red wire connects from j8 to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 9

Take a resistor with value 1 k ohm. Connect one end of the resistor to the terminal 2 of the slideswitch. One end of the resistor connects to f9, the other end of the resistor is connected to d9 of the breadboard.

Step 10

Take a red LED and connect the Anode to a9 and Cathode to a8 in the breadboard.

Step 11

Connect the Cathode of the LED to the negative terminal of the breadboard. This is the connection from a8 to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Image 13

Step 12

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Image 14

Step 13

Run the simulation. The LED turns on when the slideswitch is on.

Image 15

Step 14

The LED turns off when the slideswitch is off.

Image 16

We now have a working circuit. We will extend this experiment so that when we turn off the slideswitch the capacitor will provider power to the LED.

Step 15

Take a polarized capacitor with value: 1000 micro Farad, 16 volt. Connect it to f2 and f4 in the breadboard.

Image 17

Step 16

Connect the first terminal of the polarized capacitor to the ground. 

Image 18

The first terminal is the negative terminal of the capacitor. The polarized capacitor has polarity. 

Image 19

The connection starts from f2 and ends at the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 17

The other terminal of the polarized capacitor is the positive terminal. 

Image 20

Connect the positive terminal of the polarized capacitor to the resistor (f9 in the breadboard). This creates a parallel path for the capacitor to work when the switch is turned off. See the circuit diagram. Change the internal wire color from red to green. Retake the screenshot and update image 21.

Step 18

Run the simulation. Turn the slideswitch switch to ON position. The LED turns ON.

Image 22.

Step 19

Turn the slideswitch to OFF position. The LED dims from it full brightness.

Step 20

Finally it turns off after a few seconds.
