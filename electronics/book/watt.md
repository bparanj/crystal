A watt (W) is a unit of power. It represents the rate of energy transfer.

1. Light Bulbs:

A 60-watt light bulb uses 60 joules of energy per second to produce light and heat. If you think about how bright a 60W bulb is, you’re seeing a direct representation of 60 watts of power being consumed continuously.

2. Electric Devices:

Household devices have power ratings in watts. For example, a typical phone charger might use 5 watts, while a microwave could use 1,000 watts. Imagine these devices running—the phone charger is using a small amount of power, while the microwave consumes significantly more.

3. Energy Consumption Over Time:

One watt means that 1 joule of energy is being used every second. Imagine holding a 100-watt device like a high-power lamp and knowing that it consumes 100 joules of energy each second it's on. The faster energy is consumed, the higher the wattage.

4. Physical Work Example:

Imagine lifting a 1-kilogram weight one meter high in about one second. This requires roughly 10 watts of power, since you’re using energy at a rate that matches 10 joules per second. If you lifted it slower, you’d use less power; if you lifted it faster, you’d use more power.

   This is still not clear.

5. Solar Panels:

A 100-watt solar panel generates 100 watts of electrical power when exposed to full sunlight. This means that in one hour of bright sun, it could generate 100 watt-hours of energy. You can picture this by thinking of the sunlight continuously providing enough energy to power a 100-watt device.

By linking watts to real-world objects like light bulbs, phone chargers, and physical activities like lifting weights, you can get a sense of how much energy is being used or produced at a given moment.

## Watt and Newton

Watts and Newtons are related through movement and time. 

1 Watt = 1 Newton × 1 meter per second

In simpler terms:
- Newton measures force (push/pull)
- Watt measures power (how quickly you use energy)

Example:
When you lift a 1kg weight (≈10 Newtons):
- Lifting it slowly (1 meter in 2 seconds) = 5 Watts
- Lifting it quickly (1 meter in 1 second) = 10 Watts

Same force (Newtons), but different power (Watts) because of speed.

## Fast Worker

Watt is a measure of how quickly work is done - it's the rate of doing work or using energy.

Think of it like:
- Work = force × distance (measured in Joules)
- Power (Watts) = work ÷ time = how many Joules per second

Simple example:
- Two people lift the same heavy box up stairs (same work/Joules)
- Person A takes 1 minute
- Person B takes 30 seconds
- Person B uses more Watts (higher power) because they did the same work in less time

So 1 Watt = 1 Joule per second

Yes, a watt (W) measures how quickly work is done. It’s a unit of power, defined as one joule per second (1 W = 1 J/s). Power is the rate at which energy is transferred or converted, so a higher wattage means more energy is used or produced per second.
