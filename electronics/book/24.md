Summarize:

This experiment demonstrates the frequency response of an RC circuit and how it acts as a two-stage low-pass filter, affecting the input and output waveforms as the input frequency is varied.

1. RC Circuit Behavior:
   - The circuit consists of two RC stages connected in series.
   - Each RC stage filters high-frequency components, passing lower frequencies while attenuating higher ones.

2. Input Waveform:
   - The function generator provides a sine wave with adjustable frequency (e.g., 132 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, etc.).
   - The input waveform remains unchanged regardless of the frequency because itâ€™s directly supplied by the function generator.

3. Low-Frequency Response:
   - At low frequencies (e.g., 132 Hz), the capacitors charge and discharge slowly, allowing most of the signal to pass through.
   - The output waveform closely resembles the input waveform, showing minimal attenuation.

4. High-Frequency Attenuation:
   - At higher frequencies (e.g., 2 kHz, 9 kHz), the capacitors charge and discharge more quickly, impeding the passage of higher-frequency components.
   - The output waveform shows significant attenuation and may appear rounded or flattened as higher frequencies are filtered out.

5. Phase Shift:
   - The RC filter introduces a phase shift between the input and output signals. This shift increases as the frequency increases, demonstrating the frequency-dependent nature of capacitive circuits.

6. Cumulative Filtering Effect:
   - The two-stage design enhances the filtering effect, making the circuit more effective at attenuating high frequencies compared to a single RC filter.

### Applications

- Signal Smoothing: Reducing noise or ripples in electronic signals.
- Low-Pass Filtering: Allowing only low-frequency signals to pass, useful in audio and communication systems.
- Frequency Separation: Separating or attenuating unwanted high-frequency components in mixed signals.

This experiment demonstrates properties of RC circuits, demonstrating their behavior as frequency-dependent filters and their practical use in signal processing.
