To show how two 9V batteries in parallel can provide increased current capacity (but not increased voltage) in Tinkercad, you can set up the following experiment:

### Steps

1. Add Two 9V Batteries:
   - Drag two 9V batteries onto the Tinkercad workspace.

2. Connect the Batteries in Parallel:
   - Connect the positive terminals of both batteries together.
   - Connect the negative terminals of both batteries together. This parallel connection will maintain the 9V voltage but provide a higher current capacity.

3. Add a Load Resistor:
   - Add a resistor (e.g., 100Ω) as a load between the positive and negative terminals of the parallel battery connection.
   - This resistor will allow current to flow and simulate a load that draws current from the batteries.

4. Measure the Current with a Multimeter:
   - Place a multimeter in series with the load resistor to measure the total current flowing through the circuit.
   - Set the multimeter to measure current (A).

5. Repeat with a Single Battery:
   - Disconnect one battery and observe the current with just one 9V battery.
   - Note the current value with one battery, then reconnect the second battery in parallel and note the increased current capacity.

### Results

Single Battery:

When using one 9V battery, the current flowing through the load will be limited by that single battery’s capacity.

Parallel Batteries:

With two 9V batteries in parallel, the current supply capability effectively doubles, allowing more current to flow through the same load.

This experiment demonstrates that connecting batteries in parallel increases the current capacity (total available current) while keeping the same voltage (9V). This configuration allows the batteries to share the load, effectively increasing the runtime of the circuit.
