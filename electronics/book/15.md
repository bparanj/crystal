Batteries in Parallel

Steps

Step 1

Take a 9 volt battery and a multimeter.

Step 2

Connect the positive and negative terminals of the multimeter to the positive and negative terminal of the battery.

Step 3

Run the simulation. You will see that the battery is 9 volts.

Step 4

Stop the simulation.

Step 5

Change the multimeter setting to measure the current. Run the simulation. You can see the current through the circuit is 6 amperes.

Step 6

Remove the connections from multimeter to the battery.

Step 7

Add another 9 volt battery.

Step 8

Connect the positive terminals of the batteries together.

Step 9

Connect the negative terminals of the batteries together.

Step 10

Connect the negative terminal of the multimeter to the negative terminal of either first or the second battery.

Step 11

Connect the positive terminal of the multimeter to the positive terminal of any of the battery.

Step 12

Run the simulation. You will see that the current through the circuit is 12 amperes.

Step 13

Change the multimeter setting from amperes to volt.

Step 14

Run the simulation. The volt is the same across both batteries: 9 volts.

This shows how two 9V batteries in parallel can provide increased current capacity but not increased voltage. When using one 9V battery, the current flowing through the load will be limited by that single batteryâ€™s capacity. With two 9V batteries in parallel, the current supply capability effectively doubles, allowing more current to flow through the same load.
