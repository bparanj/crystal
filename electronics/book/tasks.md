- Review tesla tag and move into one folder (this will be the first chapter)
- Take screenshots of polarized capacitor Tinkercad simulation and add this experiment after the basic capacitor experiment
- Review discrete-passive-circuit.md
- Review passive-component.md and extract or delete experiments
- Run ack -w 'experiment' and revise
- Review Zettels and extract basic level content for different chapters
- Use coin cell battery with 3 volt to turn on LED (another way to solve the led damage problem)
- Look at the passive-device.md table in browser and review.
- Review and condense load.md
- Modify the basic capacitor experiment by replacing the capacitor with polarized capacitor
- Will both polarized and non polarized capacitor power LED when switch is turned off to cut off the power source
- Use the polarized capacitor in a new experiment with LED to show the discharge of power from capacitor
- Draw circuit diagram by hand for each experiment
- Extract summarized content from components folder and add to each experiment explanation. Add history of the term also.
- Create diagrams for mats.md
- Refer experiments.md to create the simulations for experiment 10, 11 and 12.
- Work backwards from experiments
		- Order existing experiments from simple to complex. First pass done.
		- Summarize the experiment. What is it about? What is the learning objective?
		- Write down the components used in each experiment. Refer the 0.jpg.
		- Explain each component used in the experiment.
		- Use the questions in template.md to cover the detailed explanation.
- Copy the projects in the whiteboard to this document
- 1 concept - 1 experiment. Then n concepts - 1 experiment. Finally a mini-project at the end of a section.
- Add the system concept.
		- What is a system
		- What are the elements in a system
		- How does this circuit map to a system?
- Refer simulation, run real experiments, take photos
- Review instructables for hackerboxes and take notes about using breadboard. Create diagrams to illustrate the connections.
- Refer electronics encyclopedia book and note down categorization
- Figure 1-1 Encyclopedia of Electronics
- need circuit diagram for inductor, led circuit, short circuit
- Convert hand drawn diagrams to CircuitTiz diagrams
- Render the svg using the html and take screenshots
