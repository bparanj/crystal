- Create a circuit diagram and use Tinkercad images for series battery demo Refer: Series Battery Demo. Show that the current through the circuit will be the same. See 14.md
- See 15.md for batteries in parallel.
- Connect multimeter before and after a resistor to show the current flowing is the same before or after the resistor.

Review

- Review discrete-passive-circuit.md
- Review passive-component.md and extract or delete experiments
- Review and condense load.md
- Review Zettels and extract basic level content for different chapters
- Review instructables for hackerboxes and take notes about using breadboard. Create diagrams to illustrate the connections.

- Run ack -w 'experiment' and revise

Questions




Extract

- Extract summarized content from components folder and add to each experiment explanation. Add history of the term also.

Edits

- Add the system concept.
		- What is a system
		- What are the elements in a system
		- How does this circuit map to a system?

Circuit Diagram

- Draw circuit diagram by hand for each experiment
- Create a polished version of polarized capacitor experiment and scan the circuit
- need circuit diagram for inductor, led circuit, short circuit
- Convert hand drawn diagrams to CircuitTiz diagrams

Diagrams

- Create diagrams for mats.md

Simulations


Experiments

- Refer simulation, run real experiments, take photos

Whiteboard

- Webcam to monitor every room
- Motion detector
- Plant watering
- Measure humidity inside the house (auto adjust thermostat)
- Portable high speed Internet

Misc

- Work backwards from experiments
		- Order existing experiments from simple to complex.
		- Summarize the experiment. What is it about? What is the learning objective?
		- Explain each component used in the experiment.
		- Use the questions in template.md to cover the detailed explanation.
- 1 concept - 1 experiment. Then n concepts - 1 experiment. Finally a mini-project at the end of a section.

- Refer electronics encyclopedia book and note down categorization
- Figure 1-1 Encyclopedia of Electronics

- Render the svg using the html and take screenshots

Scope

- No discussuion of any laws (only basic high level principles)
- No IC
- No coding
- No waste by causing damage to electronic components
- Discrete components
- 90% practical, 10% theory
- No discussion of topics not in Tinkercad basic section
- Basics of physics in the context of electronics
- Basics of TRIZ in the context of electronics
