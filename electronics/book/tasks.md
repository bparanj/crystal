25.md Add images e1 to e8 and describe those steps


33.md Capacitor AC Pass (see capacitor ac pass folder for images)
34.md RC High Pass Filter

20.md -> Break it down brandy with falstad.

capacitors damage image folder is empty -  images

capacitor dc block. Measure current before the capacitor. Simulate this fatstad.
why is charge-discharge folder empty Where are the images?this is in polarazed capacitor damage folder

Questions:

bypass-capacitor.md

How is the current controlled in current controller? See 16.md. How does varying the resistor value affect the amount of current flowing through the circuit. This concept should be a different experiment. This should only focus on the concept: Changing the resistor values does not have any effect of the current value before or after the resistor.

Experiments

voltage-doubler.md (This needs the transistor oscillator to be completed first)
transistor-oscillator.md


Review electronics/design/oscilloscope.md. Condense the notes.
Review function-generator.md. Condense the notes.

Positive Clamper - Watch videos. Break down into smaller experiments.

Review

- Review discrete-passive-circuit.md
- Review passive-component.md and extract or delete experiments
- Review and condense load.md
- Review Zettels and extract basic level content for different chapters
- Review instructables for hackerboxes and take notes about using breadboard. Create diagrams to illustrate the connections.

Search

- Run ack -w 'experiment' and revise

Questions

Extract

- Extract summarized content from components folder and add to each experiment explanation. Add history of the term also.

Edits

- Add the system concept.
		- What is a system
		- What are the elements in a system
		- How does this circuit map to a system?

Circuit Diagram

- Draw circuit diagram by hand for each experiment
- Create a polished version of polarized capacitor experiment and scan the circuit
- need circuit diagram for inductor, led circuit, short circuit
- Convert hand drawn diagrams to CircuitTiz diagrams

Diagrams

- Create diagrams for mats.md

Experiments

- Refer simulation, run real experiments, take photos

Whiteboard

- Webcam to monitor every room
- Motion detector
- Plant watering
- Measure humidity inside the house (auto adjust thermostat)

Misc

- Work backwards from experiments
		- Order existing experiments from simple to complex.
		- Summarize the experiment. What is it about? What is the learning objective?
		- Explain each component used in the experiment.
		- Use the questions in template.md to cover the detailed explanation.
- 1 concept - 1 experiment. Then n concepts - 1 experiment. Finally a mini-project at the end of a section.
