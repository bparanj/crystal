- Draw circuit diagram by hand for each experiment
- Extract summarized content from components folder and add to each experiment explanation. Add history of the term also.
- Take screenshots of polarized capacitor Tinkercad simulation and add this experiment after the basic capacitor experiment
- Redo LED circuit Tinkercad simulation
- What problem does thyristor solve?
- Create diagrams for mats.md
- Refer experiments.md to create the simulations for experiment 10, 11 and 12.
- Work backwards from experiments
		- Order existing experiments from simple to complex. First pass done.
		- Summarize the experiment. What is it about? What is the learning objective?
		- Write down the components used in each experiment. Refer the 0.jpg.
		- Explain each component used in the experiment.
		- Use the questions in template.md to cover the detailed explanation.
- Copy the projects in the whiteboard to this document
- 1 concept - 1 experiment. Then n concepts - 1 experiment. Finally a mini-project at the end of a section.
- Add the system concept.
		- What is a system
		- What are the elements in a system
		- How does this circuit map to a system?
- Refer simulation, run real experiments, take photos
- Review instructables for hackerboxes and take notes about using breadboard. Create diagrams to illustrate the connections.
- Review Zettels and extract basic level content for different chapters
- Refer electronics encyclopedia book and note down categorization

- need circuit diagram for inductor, led circuit, short circuit


PENDING

- Where does semiconductor fall in good conductor, insulator spectrum?
