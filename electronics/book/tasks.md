25.md capacitor dc block. Measure current before the capacitor. Simulate this fatstad.

Edit oscilloscope.md in oscilloscope folder and explain the settings for oscilloscope and function generator.

Draw diagrams for all experiments. Hand drawn and screenshots of falstad curves.
Take screenshots of falstat curves for experiments and save it in the folders.
Step must have the intent for each step besides the concrete connection details


Screenshots

- dc-decoupling.md
- transistor-current.md
- Check Inductor AC DC in biz account. Run experiment. Take screenshots. Check claude response. Create md file.
- Check Resistor V-I Curve personal account (voltage-current.md in resistive-circuit folder)

Task Breakdown

- 20.md -> Break it down brandy with falstad.
- 20.md Positive Clamper - Watch videos. Break down into smaller experiments.

Review

- Review discrete-passive-circuit.md
- Review passive-component.md and extract or delete experiments
- Review and condense load.md
- Review Zettels and extract basic level content for different chapters
- Review instructables for hackerboxes and take notes about using breadboard. Create diagrams to illustrate the connections.
- electronics/design/oscilloscope.md. Condense the notes.
- function-generator.md. Condense the notes.

Questions

Extract

- Extract summarized content from components folder and add to each experiment explanation. Add history of the term also.

Edits

- Add the system concept.
		- What is a system
		- What are the elements in a system
		- How does this circuit map to a system?

Circuit Diagram

- Draw circuit diagram by hand for each experiment
- Create a polished version of polarized capacitor experiment and scan the circuit
- need circuit diagram for inductor, led circuit, short circuit
- Convert hand drawn diagrams to CircuitTiz diagrams

Diagrams

- Create diagrams for mats.md

Experiments

- Refer simulation, run real experiments, take photos

Whiteboard

- Webcam to monitor every room
- Motion detector
- Plant watering
- Measure humidity inside the house (auto adjust thermostat)
- Portable high speed Internet

Misc

- Work backwards from experiments
		- Order existing experiments from simple to complex.
		- Summarize the experiment. What is it about? What is the learning objective?
		- Explain each component used in the experiment.
		- Use the questions in template.md to cover the detailed explanation.
- 1 concept - 1 experiment. Then n concepts - 1 experiment. Finally a mini-project at the end of a section.

- Refer electronics encyclopedia book and note down categorization
- Figure 1-1 Encyclopedia of Electronics
- Render the svg using the html and take screenshots

Scope
