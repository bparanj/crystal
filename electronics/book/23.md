RC Low-Pass Filter

### Capacitor as a Filter in AC Circuits

Here’s a simple experiment that demonstrates how a capacitor acts as a filter in an AC circuit.

### Objective

To show how a capacitor can filter high frequencies in an AC circuit by reducing the output voltage at higher frequencies.

### Components

- AC Voltage Source (simulated with a DC power source in Tinkercad, switching rapidly between values)
- Capacitor (e.g., 10 µF)
- Resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ)
- Multimeter (to measure voltage drop across the resistor and capacitor)
- Oscilloscope (to visualize the capacitor output and input to the circuit)
- Wires for connections

### Setup

1. Build the RC Low-Pass Filter:
   - Connect the AC source (approximated in Tinkercad using a square wave generator with a frequency you can change) to one end of the resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to the positive terminal of the capacitor.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the capacitor to the ground of the AC source.

2. Measurement Setup:
   - Connect the multimeter (set to measure AC voltage) across the capacitor to monitor how the output voltage changes with frequency.

3. Set the AC Frequency:
   - Start with a low frequency (simulate around 1 Hz using the frequency adjustment for the square wave in Tinkercad).
   - Measure the voltage across the capacitor. At low frequency, the capacitor will block less of the AC signal, so you should see a voltage close to the input.

4. Increase Frequency:
   - Gradually increase the square wave frequency in Tinkercad (e.g., 10 Hz, 100 Hz).
   - At higher frequencies, observe that the voltage across the capacitor decreases as the capacitor acts as a filter, blocking higher frequencies.

### Results

- At low frequencies, the capacitor passes most of the AC signal, so the voltage across it is close to the input.
- As the frequency increases, the capacitor blocks more of the AC signal, and the voltage across the capacitor decreases, illustrating the filtering effect.

This experiment demonstrates a low-pass filter effect, where the capacitor allows low-frequency signals to pass through more easily than high-frequency signals. This behavior is fundamental in electronics for filtering out noise or unwanted high-frequency components in AC signals.
