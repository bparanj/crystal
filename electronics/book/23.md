RC Low-Pass Filter

For an RC low-pass filter, it does not matter if the capacitor is polarized or non-polarized, as long as the following conditions are met:

1. DC vs. AC Signals:
   - If the low-pass filter is used with a DC-biased or purely DC signal (where the voltage stays positive or negative relative to ground), a polarized capacitor can be used. The positive terminal of the capacitor should be connected to the more positive voltage in the circuit.
   - For pure AC signals (where the voltage alternates between positive and negative values with no DC offset), it’s recommended to use a non-polarized capacitor. AC signals can reverse the polarity across a polarized capacitor, potentially damaging it over time.

2. Signal Voltage:
   - Ensure that the capacitor's voltage rating is higher than the peak voltage of the signal to avoid any breakdown or damage.

- A polarized capacitor is suitable for DC or AC with a DC offset (no polarity reversal).

Using a non-polarized capacitor is appropriate when working with a square wave from a function generator.

A square wave alternates between high and low levels, and if the signal switches between positive and negative voltages (without a consistent DC offset), a non-polarized capacitor is preferred. This type of capacitor can handle polarity reversals without damage, which makes it suitable for AC and alternating signals like square waves.

For a square wave input:

- Use a non-polarized capacitor if the waveform has both positive and negative cycles.
- If the square wave has a DC offset that keeps it entirely positive or entirely negative, a polarized capacitor would also work, as it won’t experience polarity reversal.

### Capacitor as a Filter in AC Circuits

A en experiment that demonstrates how a capacitor acts as a filter in an AC circuit.

### Objective

To show how a capacitor can filter high frequencies in an AC circuit by reducing the output voltage at higher frequencies.

### Components

- AC Voltage Source (simulated with a DC power source in Tinkercad, switching rapidly between values)
- Capacitor (e.g., 10 µF)
- Resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ)
- Multimeter (to measure voltage drop across the resistor and capacitor)
- Oscilloscope (to visualize the capacitor output and input to the circuit)
- Wires for connections

### Setup

1. Build the RC Low-Pass Filter:
   - Connect the AC source (approximated in Tinkercad using a square wave generator with a frequency you can change) to one end of the resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to the positive terminal of the capacitor.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the capacitor to the ground of the AC source.

2. Measurement Setup:
   - Connect the multimeter (set to measure AC voltage) across the capacitor to monitor how the output voltage changes with frequency.

3. Set the AC Frequency:
   - Start with a low frequency (simulate around 1 Hz using the frequency adjustment for the square wave in Tinkercad).
   - Measure the voltage across the capacitor. At low frequency, the capacitor will block less of the AC signal, so you should see a voltage close to the input.

4. Increase Frequency:
   - Gradually increase the square wave frequency in Tinkercad (e.g., 10 Hz, 100 Hz).
   - At higher frequencies, observe that the voltage across the capacitor decreases as the capacitor acts as a filter, blocking higher frequencies.

### Results

- At low frequencies, the capacitor passes most of the AC signal, so the voltage across it is close to the input.
- As the frequency increases, the capacitor blocks more of the AC signal, and the voltage across the capacitor decreases, illustrating the filtering effect.

This experiment demonstrates a low-pass filter effect, where the capacitor allows low-frequency signals to pass through more easily than high-frequency signals. This behavior is fundamental in electronics for filtering out noise or unwanted high-frequency components in AC signals.

If you increase the frequency to 7.33 kHz. Because the scale of the oscilloscope is small, you see a thick line in the input. The output across the capacitor has shifted below the horizontal line and is in milli volts.
