Step 15

Connect the positive terminal of the output oscilloscope to the f8 in the breadboard. The output oscilloscope is now connected across the capacitor. We will now be able observe the behavior of the capacitor as we change the frequency of the input.

Step 16

Change the frequency of the input function generator to 1 Hz. You can see at low frequency, the capacitor passes the current. It does not block it. The input wave form has been smoothened a bit on the edges.

At 1.42 kHz. The output oscilloscope shows that the output voltage is in milli volts. The input is 5 volts. So the output voltage is very negligible. It has blocked the high frequency signal for practial purposes.

Step 19

Change the input frequency of the function generator to 100 Hz. You can see the input and the output. The square wave form has become a saw tooth wave form.

Step 20

Change the input frequency to 2.61 kHz. The output is shifted down below the horizontal line. The voltage output across the capacitor is in milli volts.

Step 21

If you increase the frequency to 7.33 kHz. Because the scale of the oscilloscope is small, you see a thick line in the input. The output across the capacitor has shifted below the horizontal line and is in milli volts.

Step 22

Change the input frequency to 1 MHz. This is the highest so far. You can now see the output voltage across the capacitor has decreased to micro volts.

This experiment demonstrates an RC low-pass filter using a resistor and capacitor, focusing on how the capacitor's behavior changes with different input frequencies from a function generator set to a square wave.

At low frequencies (e.g., 1 Hz), the capacitor allows the signal to pass through with minimal blocking. In this range, the capacitor has time to charge and discharge with each cycle of the square wave.

The output waveform closely resembles the input square wave, but the edges appear slightly rounded, showing how the capacitor smooths rapid transitions.

As the frequency increases (e.g., 100 Hz to 1.42 kHz), the capacitor starts to resist the signal more effectively. This occurs because the capacitive reactance (\(X_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}\)) decreases with increasing frequency, causing the capacitor to act more like a short circuit for high frequencies.

At 1.42 kHz, the output voltage across the capacitor is minimal (in millivolts), indicating that the capacitor is blocking the high-frequency components of the input signal.

At very high frequencies (e.g., 7.33 kHz and above), the output voltage across the capacitor becomes negligible, measured in microvolts at 1 MHz. This shows that the capacitor effectively blocks the high-frequency components, preventing them from reaching the output.

The capacitor now appears almost like an open circuit, as it charges and discharges so quickly that it cannot pass significant current through.

When the input frequency is increased to an intermediate range (e.g., around 100 Hz), the square waveform starts transforming into a sawtooth waveform at the output. This shape change results from the capacitor’s charging and discharging patterns, which smooth out the rapid transitions in the square wave.

This effect illustrates the capacitor’s role in filtering out high-frequency components, effectively smoothing the waveform.

The RC circuit acts as a low-pass filter, allowing low-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating or blocking high-frequency signals. The point at which the filter significantly attenuates the signal is the cutoff frequency, determined by the values of the resistor and capacitor.

This experiment demonstrates that:

- Low frequencies pass through the filter with minimal blocking.
- Higher frequencies are increasingly attenuated, showing the filter's ability to block high-frequency components.
- At very high frequencies, the capacitor blocks nearly all signal, allowing only a small residual voltage through.

This demonstrates the basic behavior of an RC low-pass filter and shows how capacitors can be used in circuits to allow only certain frequencies to pass.
