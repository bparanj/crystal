# Filament

A filament in a bulb is a thin wire, usually made of tungsten, that produces light when electricity passes through it.

Tungsten is used for filaments because it has a high melting point (over 3,400°C) and can withstand the intense heat generated by the electrical current.

When current flows through the filament, its resistance to the current causes it to heat up to a high temperature. At such high temperatures, the filament glows, emitting visible light. This process is called incandescence.

The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb that’s either vacuum-sealed or filled with an inert gas, like argon or nitrogen, to prevent the tungsten from burning out quickly due to oxidation.

### Function in a Bulb

The filament is the primary light-producing component in incandescent bulbs. Its high resistance converts electrical energy into both heat and light energy, creating the familiar warm glow.
