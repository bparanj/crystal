Steps

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Create the same circuit that is shown in Back EMF DC experiment.

Step 3

Instead of DC power source, we will use a function generator as a AC source. Take a function generator and set the frequency to 1 Hz, 8 volts and 0 DC offset. Choose square wave form for the input.

Step 4

Connect the function generator to the breadboard.

Step 5

Run the simulation. The blue LED turns on. The red LED turns on. It alternates as the square wave form switches from positive to negative.

If you are not seeing the LEDs turn on. Make sure the switch is in on position.
