Step 3

Instead of DC power source, we will use a function generator as a AC source. Take a function generator and set the frequency to 1 Hz, 8 volts and 0 DC offset. Choose square wave form for the input.

Step 4

Connect the function generator to the breadboard.

Step 5

Run the simulation. The blue LED turns on. The red LED turns on. It alternates as the square wave form switches from positive to negative.

PENDING

Summarize: 

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of an inductive circuit with an alternating current (AC) square wave input. It demonstrates the principles of back electromotive force (EMF) and current direction reversal in response to the AC signal.

1. AC Signal Behavior:
   - The function generator produces a square wave signal alternating between positive and negative voltages.
   - As the voltage alternates, the current direction through the circuit also alternates, turning the LEDs on and off based on their polarity.

2. Inductive Response to AC:
   - The inductor responds to the square wave by generating a back EMF each time the current direction changes.
   - The inductor opposes rapid changes in current, causing energy to flow momentarily even as the signal switches polarity.

3. LED Polarity and Current Reversal:
   - The blue LED lights up during the positive half of the square wave, as current flows in the forward direction for that LED.
   - The red LED lights up during the negative half of the square wave, as the current direction reverses and forward-biases the red LED.

4. Back EMF and Transient Energy:
   - The inductor momentarily stores energy in its magnetic field during each half-cycle and releases it when the square wave reverses.
   - This transient behavior demonstrates the role of inductors in managing current flow during polarity changes.

### Applications

AC Circuits: 

Demonstrates how inductors and polarized components behave with alternating currents.

Back EMF: 

Highlights the inductive response to changes in current, a critical concept in motor control, transformers, and power systems.

Current Reversal: 

Shows how LEDs and other polarized components can be used to visualize current direction in AC circuits.

This experiment provides insights into how inductors interact with AC signals, how back EMF affects circuit behavior, and how current direction changes impact polarized components like LEDs.
