Current Divider

A current divider circuit allows the input current to be split between two or more parallel branches based on their resistances (or impedances in AC circuits).

In a current divider, the total current \( I_{\text{total}} \) entering the parallel branches splits among the branches, with the amount of current in each branch inversely proportional to the resistance of that branch.

For two resistors \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) in parallel, the current through each resistor can be calculated as:

- Current through \( R_1 \):
  \[
  I_1 = I_{\text{total}} \cdot \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}
  \]

- Current through \( R_2 \):
  \[
  I_2 = I_{\text{total}} \cdot \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}
  \]

A current divider circuit uses two resistors in parallel.

#### Components:

1. DC Power Source: e.g., 9V battery or DC supply.
2. Resistor \( R_1 \): e.g., 1 kΩ.
3. Resistor \( R_2 \): e.g., 2 kΩ.
4. Ammeter or Multimeter: To measure the current through each branch.

#### Setup:

Connect the positive terminal of the DC power source to one end of both \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) resistors.

Connect the other end of \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) to the negative terminal of the power supply (forming a parallel circuit).

Place an ammeter in each branch or use a multimeter to measure the current through \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \).
Alternatively, you could calculate the expected currents using the formulas above.

The current through each resistor depends on its resistance. For example, if \( R_1 = 1 \, \text{kΩ} \) and \( R_2 = 2 \, \text{kΩ} \) with a total current \( I_{\text{total}} \), more current will flow through \( R_1 \) (lower resistance) than through \( R_2 \).

This simple circuit shows how current divides between parallel branches based on resistance, following the principle of a current divider.

With a 9 volt battery, the current through the circuit is 6 ampere.

Steps

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take a multimeter. Change the setting to measure current. You can see A is selected. Run the simulation. Measure the current between the positive and negative terminals of the breadboard. You can see it is 6 amperes.

Image 2

Is the resistance of the multimeter = 9/6 ?

The current shown (6 amperes) is primarily determined by the internal resistance of the multimeter when it's set to measure current and connected directly across the battery terminals.

Low Resistance in Current Measurement Mode:

In current measurement mode, multimeters are designed to have very low internal resistance to allow the current to flow through them as if they were just a wire. This enables the meter to measure the current in a circuit accurately without introducing much resistance.

However, if you connect the multimeter directly across the battery without any load, the low internal resistance creates a near-short circuit condition.

Battery’s Internal Resistance:

A real battery has a small internal resistance, typically very low for a 9V battery. The current flowing directly across the battery terminals depends on this internal resistance and the low resistance path of the multimeter.

Since this setup essentially shorts the battery, the internal resistance of the battery and the low resistance of the multimeter together limit the current you see (in this case, 6 amperes).

Potential Damage:

Connecting a multimeter directly across a battery in current mode is generally not recommended. It can damage the multimeter, overheat the battery, or even cause harm, as most multimeters aren’t designed to handle high currents for prolonged periods.

The 6-ampere reading is due to the very low internal resistance of the multimeter in current mode, combined with the battery's internal resistance. This setup effectively creates a short circuit, allowing a large current to flow briefly.

Step 3

Stop the simulation.

Step 4

Connect the positive lead of the multimeter to the end of the second resistor.

Image 4

Remove the wire that connects the end of the second resistor to the ground. Now the multimeter is in series with the resistor. To read the current value, multimeter must be connected in series to check the value flowing through the second resistor.

Image 5

Step 5

Run the simulation. The current through the second resistor is 4.49 mA. This resistor has 2 k ohm value.

Step 6

Connect the second resistor back to the ground. Connect the positive lead of the multimeter to the end of the first resistor.

Image 7

Remove the wire that connects the first resistor to the ground. Now the multimeter is in series with the first resistor.

Step 7

Image 8

Run the simulation. You can see the current through the first resistor is 8.98 m A. It is higher than the second resistor because the value of first resistor is lower than the second resistor.

Image 9

Step 8

Change the value of the second resistor to 1 k ohm. Now both are 1 k ohm resistors. Connect the multimeter to the second resistor.

Step 9

Run the simulation. The current through the second resistor is 8.97 mA.

Step 10

Connect the multimeter to the first resistor.

Image 12.

Step 11

Run the simulation. The current through the first resistor is also 8.97 mA.

The experiment illustrates the current divider rule, which states that in a parallel circuit, the current through each resistor is inversely proportional to its resistance. This principle is used in analyzing and designing circuits with parallel components.

This experiment shows that in a parallel circuit, current divides between branches based on their resistance values. The lower the resistance, the higher the current flow in that branch.

The current is equal when the value of the resistors are equal. If they are different, the lower value resistor allows more current to flow through that part of the circuit. When resistors are connected in parallel, the total current supplied by the battery is divided between the resistors. The amount of current through each resistor depends on its resistance.

Lower resistance allows more current to flow through that branch of the circuit. In this setup, the 1 kΩ resistor allows more current than the 2 kΩ resistor when they are different.

When both resistors are equal (1 kΩ each), the current divides equally, with each resistor receiving half of the total current through the circuit.

To measure the current through each resistor, the multimeter is connected in series with each resistor in turn.
