Steps

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take a polarized capacitor. Change its value to 10 micro Farad, 16 volts. Place it on h4 and h6 in the breadboard. In this configuration, the capacitor will charge or discharge depending on the input voltage polarity and the diodeâ€™s behavior.

Step 3

Connect i6 to i13 in the breadboard. This is the green wire.

Step 4

Connect a diode at d11 and f11 in the breadboard.

Step 5

Connect h13 to h17. This is the green wire.

Step 6

Connect the 10 k ohm resistor to d17 and f17 in the breadboard. The resistor controls the charging and discharging rate of the capacitor.

Step 7

Connect the diode to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. This is the black wire from a13 to the negative terminal.

Step 8

Connect the resistor to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. This is the black wire from a17 to the negative terminal.

The capacitor is in parallel with the diode-resistor combination. This configuration achieves the desired clamping action by charging the capacitor during certain parts of the AC cycle and maintaining the DC shift.

Take a function generator. Change the settings to 1000 Hz and 15 volts.

Step 10

Connect the negative terminal of the function generator to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Step 12

Take an oscilloscope. Change the time division to 0.2 m seconds.

Step 13

Connect the negative terminal of the oscilloscope to the negative terminal of the function generator.

Step 14

Connect the positive terminal of the oscilloscope to the positive terminal of the function generator. We can now see the input to the circuit that is generated by the function generator using the oscilloscope.

Step 15

Connect the capacitor to the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Step 16

Run the simulation. You can now see the input to the circuit in the oscilloscope as a sine wave.

Step 17

Take another oscilloscope, change the setting to 0.2 m seconds. This will be used to see the output of the circuit.

Step 18

Connect the negative terminal of the output oscilloscope to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Step 19

Connect the positive terminal of the output oscilloscope to the i17 in the breadboard.

Step 20

Run the simulation. You can see the input and the output in the oscilloscopes.

The output shows that the sine wave form has shifted below the horizontal line.

The diode allows current to flow in one direction, essentially clamping or holding the voltage to a certain level.

This clamping circuit shifts the voltage waveform.

- During the negative half-cycle of an AC waveform, the diode conducts, allowing the capacitor to charge.
- During the positive half-cycle, the diode blocks current, and the capacitor holds its charge.
- The effect is a shift in the entire waveform upwards or downwards, depending on the configuration, without altering the shape of the AC signal.

This is called a clamping circuit or DC restorer because it shifts the waveform to add or remove a DC offset. It shifts the waveform downward, it's a negative clamping circuit.
