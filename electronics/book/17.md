Negative Clamping Circuit

It is intended to clamp or shift the waveform in the negative direction.

Polarized Capacitor: 

In this configuration, the capacitor will charge or discharge depending on the input voltage polarity and the diode’s behavior.

Diode: 

The diode allows current to flow in one direction, essentially “clamping” or holding the voltage to a certain level.

Resistor: 

The resistor controls the charging and discharging rate of the capacitor.

This clamping circuit shifts the voltage waveform, ensuring it stays above or below a certain level by adding or subtracting a DC component. In this case:

- During the negative half-cycle of an AC waveform, the diode conducts, allowing the capacitor to charge.
- During the positive half-cycle, the diode blocks current, and the capacitor holds its charge.
- The effect is a shift in the entire waveform upwards or downwards, depending on the configuration, without altering the shape of the AC signal.

This is typically called a clamping circuit or DC restorer because it shifts the waveform to add or remove a DC offset. It shifts the waveform downward (clamps it negatively), it's a negative clamping circuit.

The capacitor is in parallel with the diode-resistor combination. This configuration achieves the desired clamping action by charging the capacitor during certain parts of the AC cycle and maintaining the DC shift.
