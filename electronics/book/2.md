## LED

LED stands for Light Emitting Diode. It has polarity. This means it has a positive and a negative side, and it will only allow current to flow in one direction.

The longer lead of an LED is called the Anode. This is the positive side. Anode should be connected to the positive terminal of a power source.

The shorter lead of an LED is called the Cathode. This is the negative side. Cathode should be connected to the negative terminal of a power source.

LEDs emit light when current flows through it. Because they are diodes, they only conduct current in one direction. The current flows from Anode to Cathode. If you connect an LED in the wrong way by not connecting Anode and Cathode to the correct terminal of a power source, it will not turn on. 

## Tinkercad Simulation

To choose the voltage for a power source in a circuit:

Determine Component Requirements: Check the voltage needs of all components, ensuring they operate within their specified voltage range.

Consider Voltage Drops: Account for any significant voltage drops across components like resistors or diodes, and adjust the power source accordingly.

Safety Margin: Add a small buffer above the minimum required voltage to account for variations and tolerances.

Power Efficiency: Balance providing enough voltage with minimizing excess heat for efficient operation.

Standard Voltage Levels: If possible, select a common voltage level (e.g., 3.3V, 5V, 12V) to simplify design.

Battery vs. Mains Power: For battery-powered devices, consider standard battery voltages.

Regulation Needs: Decide if a regulated power supply is needed for stable voltage.

Current Capacity: Ensure the power source can supply sufficient current at the chosen voltage without exceeding its limits.

Application Constraints: Consider size, weight, and cost limitations of the power source.

Future Expansion: Allow headroom for potential circuit additions or modifications.

Step 8

Run the simulation. You can see the LED gets damaged.

Step 9

Hover over the broken LED, you can see the message: Current through the LED is 915 mA, while absolute maximum is 20 mA.

Image 10

Each LED has a datasheet provided by the manufacturer, which specifies its electrical characteristics, including the maximum current it can handle. Most general-purpose LEDs can safely handle up to 20 mA. Exceeding this can damage the LED. Check the datasheet or product specifications to confirm the current rating for your specific LED model.

To safely operate an LED, you need to choose a power supply that, together with a current-limiting resistor, will not exceed the LED’s safe current limit.

Step 10

Stop the simulation.

Step 11

Remove the 9 volt battery from the circuit.

Step 12

Choose a 3 volt coin battery as the power source.

Step 13

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 14

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 15

Run the simulation. You can see the LED turns on. It is not damaged. However, we get an information icon.

If you hover over the icon i inside a circle, you can see the message: Current through the LED is 61.9 mA, while recommended maximum is 20 mA. The usuable lifetime of the LED may be reduced.

1. Determine the Forward Voltage: This is the voltage required to light the LED. It's usually around:
   - 2V for Red LEDs.
   - 3.2V for Blue, White, or Green LEDs.

   The forward voltage should be found in the LED's datasheet.

2. Power Supply Selection: You can choose any power supply voltage as long as you include a current-limiting resistor to protect the LED. For example, with a 9V battery, you must use a resistor to ensure the current stays within safe limits.

To pick the correct resistor, use Ohm’s Law:

   \[
   R = \frac{V_{supply} - V_{forward}}{I_{safe}}
   \]

Where:
- \( V_{supply} \) is the battery or power supply voltage.
- \( V_{forward} \) is the forward voltage of the LED.
- \( I_{safe} \) is the safe current limit for the LED (usually 20 mA or 0.02 A).

Assume you have a 9V battery and a red LED with a forward voltage of 2V and a maximum safe current of 20 mA.

1. Supply Voltage \( V_{supply} = 9V \)
2. LED Forward Voltage \( V_{forward} = 2V \)
3. Safe Current \( I_{safe} = 0.02A \)

Plug the values into the formula:

   \[
   R = \frac{9V - 2V}{0.02A} = \frac{7V}{0.02A} = 350 \, \Omega
   \]

So, a 350 Ω resistor would limit the current to a safe level for the LED.

- Always use a current-limiting resistor with LEDs.
- Check the LED’s datasheet for the maximum current and forward voltage.
- Use Ohm’s Law to calculate the resistor needed to protect the LED.

Without controlling the current, as demonstrated in the Tinkercad simulation, the LED will receive excessive current, causing it to overheat and fail—usually indicated by the message showing that the current far exceeds the safe limit.

1. LED Damage: 

An LED burns out when excessive current flows through it due to lack of current-limiting resistor.

2. Battery Voltage Selection: Choose based on:
   - LED forward voltage requirements
   - Circuit design needs
   - Availability and practicality
   - Common values: 3V, 5V, 9V, 12V

3. Maximum LED Current:
   - Check LED datasheet specifications
   - Typical max current is 20mA for standard LEDs
   - Exceeding max current causes permanent damage

4. Safe Voltage Source Selection:
   - Must consider LED forward voltage drop
   - Should be higher than LED forward voltage
   - Not so high that it requires large power-wasting resistor

5. Resistor Value Selection:
   - Use Ohm's Law: R = (V_source - V_LED) / I_LED
   - V_source = Battery voltage
   - V_LED = LED forward voltage (typically 1.8-3.3V)
   - I_LED = Desired current (usually 20mA or less)
   - Example: For 9V battery, 2V LED, 20mA current:
     R = (9V - 2V) / 0.02A = 350Ω

This simulation demonstrates why a current-limiting resistor is essential for LED circuits and how to calculate the appropriate component values.
