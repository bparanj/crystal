A single current value cannot work for all components because:

1. Different Requirements: Components have varying current and power needs based on their functionality (e.g., LEDs, motors, ICs).
2. Performance: Too low a current may not power high-demand components; too high a current can damage sensitive components.
3. Circuit Functionality: Specific currents are required for proper operation in circuits like amplifiers, sensors, or communication devices.

Circuits must tailor current to each component’s needs for efficiency, safety, and functionality.

Why do we need to allow flow of current in only one direction in a diode?

Allowing current to flow in only one direction is essential for:

1. Rectification: Converting AC to DC in power supplies.
2. Protection: Preventing damage to components from reverse currents.
3. Signal Control: Enabling proper operation in circuits like logic gates or amplifiers.
4. Energy Storage: Ensuring correct charging and discharging of capacitors or batteries.

This is typically achieved using diodes.

Why do we need a light emitting device in electronic circuits?

A light-emitting device, like an LED, is used in electronic circuits for:

1. Indication: To visually indicate power status, operation, or errors.
2. Debugging: To verify circuit functionality, such as showing if current is flowing.
3. Communication: To convey information via light signals (e.g., in optical communication or displays).
4. Lighting: For illumination in various applications.

It provides a simple, energy-efficient way to make circuit activity visible.

LED

LED stands for Light Emitting Diode. It has polarity. This means it has a positive and a negative side, and it will only allow current to flow in one direction. The longer lead of an LED is called the Anode. This is the positive side. Anode should be connected to the positive terminal of a power source. The shorter lead of an LED is called the Cathode. This is the negative side. Cathode should be connected to the negative terminal of a power source.

LEDs emit light when current flows through it. Because they are diodes, they only conduct current in one direction. The current flows from Anode to Cathode. If you connect an LED in the wrong way by not connecting Anode and Cathode to the correct terminal of a power source, it will not turn on.

Steps

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery.

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 5

Connect the LED to the breadboard.

Step 6

The bigger leg of the LED is called the Anode. Connect Anode to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 7

The smaller leg of the LED is called the Cathode. Connect Cathode to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 8

Run the simulation. You can see the LED gets damaged.

Step 9

Hover over the broken LED, you can see the message: Current through the LED is 915 mA, while absolute maximum is 20 mA.

Image 10

Each LED has a datasheet provided by the manufacturer, which specifies its electrical characteristics, including the maximum current it can handle. Most general-purpose LEDs can safely handle up to 20 mA. Exceeding this can damage the LED. Check the datasheet or product specifications to confirm the current rating for your specific LED model.

To safely operate an LED, you need to choose a power supply that, together with a current-limiting resistor, will not exceed the LED’s safe current limit.

Step 10

Stop the simulation.

Step 11

Remove the 9 volt battery from the circuit.

Image 12

Step 12

Choose a 3 volt coin battery as the power source.

Step 13

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 14

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 15

Run the simulation. You can see the LED turns on. It is not damaged. However, we get an information icon.

Image 16

If you hover over the icon i inside a circle, you can see the message:

Current through the LED is 61.9 mA, while recommended maximum is 20 mA. The usuable lifetime of the LED may be reduced.

This experiment demonstrates the importance of choosing an appropriate power source and using current-limiting resistor when working with LEDs to avoid damage.
