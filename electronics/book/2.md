LED damage

Demonstrate what happens to an electronic component when the current is not controlled.

Tinkercad Simulation

Step 1

Take a breadboard

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery.

How to choose the voltage of a battery? See Choosing the Voltage Source section.

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 5

Connect the LED to the breadboard.

Step 6

The bigger leg of the LED is called the Anode. Connect Anode to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 7

The smaller leg of the LED is called the Cathode. Connect Cathode to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 8

Run the simulation. You can see the LED gets damaged.

Step 9

Hover over the broken LED, you can see the message: Current through the LED is 915 mA, while absolute maximum is 20 mA.

- How do we know the maximum current that an LED can safely handle?
- How to choose the voltage source that will limit the current to the safe level?
- How to pick the value of resistor that can limit current to the safe level?

### How to Know the Maximum Current an LED Can Safely Handle
Each LED has a datasheet provided by the manufacturer, which specifies its electrical characteristics, including the maximum current it can handle. Most general-purpose LEDs can safely handle up to **20 mA**. Exceeding this can damage the LED. Check the datasheet or product specifications to confirm the current rating for your specific LED model.

### Choosing the Voltage Source

To safely operate an LED, you need to choose a power supply that, together with a current-limiting resistor, will not exceed the LED’s safe current limit.

1. **Determine the Forward Voltage**: This is the voltage required to light the LED. It's usually around:
   - 2V for Red LEDs.
   - 3.2V for Blue, White, or Green LEDs.
   
   The forward voltage should be found in the LED's datasheet.

2. **Power Supply Selection**: You can choose any power supply voltage as long as you include a current-limiting resistor to protect the LED. For example, with a 9V battery, you must use a resistor to ensure the current stays within safe limits.

### Calculating the Resistor Value to Limit Current
To pick the correct resistor, use **Ohm’s Law**:
   
   \[
   R = \frac{V_{supply} - V_{forward}}{I_{safe}}
   \]
   
Where:
- \( V_{supply} \) is the battery or power supply voltage.
- \( V_{forward} \) is the forward voltage of the LED.
- \( I_{safe} \) is the safe current limit for the LED (usually 20 mA or 0.02 A).

### Example Calculation
Assume you have a **9V** battery and a red LED with a forward voltage of **2V** and a maximum safe current of **20 mA**.

1. **Supply Voltage** \( V_{supply} = 9V \)
2. **LED Forward Voltage** \( V_{forward} = 2V \)
3. **Safe Current** \( I_{safe} = 0.02A \)

Plug the values into the formula:

   \[
   R = \frac{9V - 2V}{0.02A} = \frac{7V}{0.02A} = 350 \, \Omega
   \]

So, a **350 Ω resistor** would limit the current to a safe level for the LED.

### Key Takeaways
- Always use a **current-limiting resistor** with LEDs.
- **Check the LED’s datasheet** for the maximum current and forward voltage.
- Use **Ohm’s Law** to calculate the resistor needed to protect the LED.

Without controlling the current, as demonstrated in the Tinkercad simulation, the LED will receive excessive current, causing it to overheat and fail—usually indicated by the message showing that the current far exceeds the safe limit.

Here is the explanation:

1. LED Damage: An LED burns out when excessive current flows through it due to lack of current-limiting resistor.

2. Battery Voltage Selection: Choose based on:
   - LED forward voltage requirements
   - Circuit design needs
   - Availability and practicality
   - Common values: 3V, 5V, 9V, 12V

3. Maximum LED Current:
   - Check LED datasheet specifications
   - Typical max current is 20mA for standard LEDs
   - Exceeding max current causes permanent damage

4. Safe Voltage Source Selection:
   - Must consider LED forward voltage drop
   - Should be higher than LED forward voltage
   - Not so high that it requires large power-wasting resistor

5. Resistor Value Selection:
   - Use Ohm's Law: R = (V_source - V_LED) / I_LED
   - V_source = Battery voltage
   - V_LED = LED forward voltage (typically 1.8-3.3V)
   - I_LED = Desired current (usually 20mA or less)
   - Example: For 9V battery, 2V LED, 20mA current:
     R = (9V - 2V) / 0.02A = 350Ω

This simulation demonstrates why a current-limiting resistor is essential for LED circuits and how to calculate the appropriate component values.
