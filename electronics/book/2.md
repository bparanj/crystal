LED damage

Demonstrate what happens to an electronic component when the current is not controlled.

Tinkercad Simulation

Step 1

Take a breadboard

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery.

How to choose the voltage of a battery?

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 5

Connect the LED to the breadboard.

Step 6

The bigger leg of the LED is called the Anode. Connect Anode to the positive terminal of the breadboard.


Step 7

The smaller leg of the LED is called the Cathode. Connect Cathode to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 8

Run the simulation. You can see the LED gets damaged.

Step 9

Hover over the broken LED, you can see the message: Current through the LED is 915 mA, while absolute maximum is 20 mA.

How do we know the maximum current that an LED can safely handle?
How to choose the voltage source that will limit the current to the safe level?
How to pick the value of resistor that can limit current to the safe level?
