Why not have one current value that works with all components in a circuit?
This current will be safe for all devices in a circuit.

Why do we need to allow flow of current in only one direction in a diode?
Why do we need a light emitting device in electronic circuits?

LED damage

Demonstrate what happens to an electronic component when the current is not controlled.

LED

LED stands for Light Emitting Diode. It has polarity. This means it has a positive and a negative side, and it will only allow current to flow in one direction. The longer lead of an LED is called the Anode. This is the positive side. Anode should be connected to the positive terminal of a power source. The shorter lead of an LED is called the Cathode. This is the negative side. Cathode should be connected to the negative terminal of a power source.

LEDs emit light when current flows through it. Because they are diodes, they only conduct current in one direction. The current flows from Anode to Cathode. If you connect an LED in the wrong way by not connecting Anode and Cathode to the correct terminal of a power source, it will not turn on.

Steps

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery.

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 5

Connect the LED to the breadboard.

Step 6

The bigger leg of the LED is called the Anode. Connect Anode to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 7

The smaller leg of the LED is called the Cathode. Connect Cathode to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 8

Run the simulation. You can see the LED gets damaged.

Step 9

Hover over the broken LED, you can see the message: Current through the LED is 915 mA, while absolute maximum is 20 mA.

Each LED has a datasheet provided by the manufacturer, which specifies its electrical characteristics, including the maximum current it can handle. Most general-purpose LEDs can safely handle up to 20 mA. Exceeding this can damage the LED. Check the datasheet or product specifications to confirm the current rating for your specific LED model.

To safely operate an LED, you need to choose a power supply that, together with a current-limiting resistor, will not exceed the LEDâ€™s safe current limit.

Step 10

Stop the simulation.

Step 11

Remove the 9 volt battery from the circuit.

Image 12

Step 12

Choose a 3 volt coin battery as the power source.

Step 13

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 14

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 15

Run the simulation. You can see the LED turns on. It is not damaged. However, we get an information icon.

Image 16

If you hover over the icon i inside a circle, you can see the message:

Current through the LED is 61.9 mA, while recommended maximum is 20 mA. The usuable lifetime of the LED may be reduced.

This experiment demonstrates the importance of choosing an appropriate power source and using current-limiting resistor when working with LEDs to avoid damage.
