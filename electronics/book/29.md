To demonstrate that current flows through the path of least resistance using Tinkercad, you can set up a simple parallel circuit with two branches, each containing different resistances. Here’s how you can set up this experiment.

### Objective:

To show that current prefers to flow through a lower resistance path in a parallel circuit.

### Components:

- 1 Power Source (e.g., 9V battery)
- 2 Resistors (one with a low resistance, like 100 Ω, and another with a higher resistance, like 1 kΩ)
- 2 LEDs (to indicate current flow through each branch)
- Breadboard and Wires

### Steps:

1. Set Up the Power Supply:
   - Connect the positive terminal of the 9V battery to the positive rail of the breadboard.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the 9V battery to the ground rail.

2. Create Two Parallel Paths:
   - In the first path, place a 100 Ω resistor in series with an LED.
   - In the second path, place a 1 kΩ resistor in series with another LED.
   
3. Connect the Paths to the Power Source:
   - Connect the start of each path (before the resistor) to the positive rail of the breadboard.
   - Connect the end of each path (after the LED) to the ground rail.

4. Observe the LEDs:
   - When you connect the battery, both LEDs should light up. However, the LED in the path with the 100 Ω resistor will be noticeably brighter than the LED in the path with the 1 kΩ resistor.
   - This is because the lower resistance path (100 Ω) allows more current to flow through it, making the LED brighter in that branch.


In a parallel circuit, the branch with lower resistance will allow more current to flow compared to the higher resistance branch. This experiment visually demonstrates that current favors the path with the least resistance, as shown by the brightness difference in the LEDs.
