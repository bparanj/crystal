This experiment is an extension of experiment transistor as a switch in a circuit (10.md). The polarized capacitor takes a few seconds to charge. The LED stays off. After the capacitor is charged, the blinking LED from the original extension now stays almost on,  even though it flickers it is not completely off. This demonstrates how the capacitor smooths out the voltage fluctions.

The circuit where a capacitor is used to smooth the voltage is typically called a filter circuit, specifically a capacitor filter or smoothing filter. In the context of an LED circuit, this configuration acts as a simple low-pass filter.

In power supply circuits, this type of filter is used to reduce ripples in the output after rectification, providing a more stable DC voltage. In this case, the capacitor smooths the pulsating signal from the function generator, allowing the LED to remain lit more steadily by reducing fluctuations in the voltage across it.

Without Capacitor:

The LED blinks in sync with the signal from the function generator as the transistor switches on and off.

With Capacitor:

The capacitor will charge when the transistor is on and discharge slowly when the transistor is off, which smooths out the voltage. This effect keeps the LED lit more steadily and reduces the blinking effect.

The capacitor acts as a temporary storage of charge, releasing current when the transistor turns off, thus preventing the LED from turning off completely. This demonstration shows how capacitors can smooth fluctuating signals, which is relevant in applications like rectifiers and power supplies where stable output is needed.

This setup shows the smoothing function of the capacitor in a switching circuit, providing a simple example of filtering in electronics.
