Push Button

Demonstrate the use of pushbutton to control the flow of current through a circuit.

Components

1. Pushbutton
2. Red LED
3. Resistor with 1 k ohm value
4. 9 volt battery

Step 1

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard. Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 2

Place the pushbutton on the breadboard such that it connects the section B and section C of the breadboard.

Step 3

Connect the LED to the section B of the breadboard such that the Cathode is connected to the one end of the pushbutton.

Step 4

Connect one end of the resistor to the Cathode of the LED and the other end of the resistor to the section C of the breadboard.

Step 5

Connect the resistor on the section C of the breadboard to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 6

Connect the pushbutton terminal to the postive terminal of the breadboard. This completes the circuit.

A closeup image shows the connections between the components.

Step 7

Run the simulation. Push the button by pressing the pushbutton in the middle. The red LED will now glow. 

When you push the pushbutton, we have a closed circuit. The current can flow through a closed circuit.

Step 8

When you release the pushbutton, the circuit will open and the LED will not glow.

### Key Takeaways

1. Pushbutton Control: A

 pushbutton allows you to manually control the flow of current, acting as a switch that can open or close the circuit.

2. Circuit On/Off: 

Pressing the pushbutton completes the circuit, allowing current to flow and the LED to light up. Releasing the button opens the circuit, turning the LED off.

3. Current Limiting Resistor: 

A 1 kÎ© resistor is included to limit the current through the LED, protecting it from potential damage.

4. Simple Interaction: 

Pushbuttons provide a simple way to control circuits without complex electronics, ideal for basic on/off control in projects.
