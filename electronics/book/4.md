1. Pushbutton Control: A

 pushbutton allows you to manually control the flow of current, acting as a switch that can open or close the circuit.

2. Circuit On/Off: 

Pressing the pushbutton completes the circuit, allowing current to flow and the LED to light up. Releasing the button opens the circuit, turning the LED off.

3. Current Limiting Resistor: 

A 1 kÎ© resistor is included to limit the current through the LED, protecting it from potential damage.

4. Simple Interaction: 

Pushbuttons provide a simple way to control circuits without complex electronics, ideal for basic on/off control in projects.
