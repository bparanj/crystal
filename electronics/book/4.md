Step 6

Connect the pusbutton to the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Step 7

Connect the postive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. This completes the circuit.

Step 9

The pushbutton allows you to manually control the flow of current, acting as a switch that can open or close the circuit.

Pressing the pushbutton completes the circuit, allowing current to flow and the LED to light up. Releasing the button opens the circuit, turning the LED off.
