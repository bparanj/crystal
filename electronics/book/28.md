A simple experiment to illustrate the concept of a voltage regulator:

PENDING

Modify Voltage Regulator. Replace 9 volt battery with variable power supply. Complete the experiment. Take screenshots

### Objective:

To demonstrate how a voltage regulator maintains a constant output voltage even when the input voltage varies.

### Materials:

- A 9V battery
- A 7805 voltage regulator (used to regulate to 5V)
- A multimeter to measure voltage
- A small load (like an LED with a series resistor)

### Procedure:

1. Set Up the Circuit:

   - Place the 7805 voltage regulator on the breadboard. Connect the input pin of the regulator to the positive terminal of the DC power supply.
   - Connect the ground pin of the regulator to the negative terminal of the power supply.
   - Connect the output pin of the regulator to the positive terminal of the LED (with the series resistor). Connect the negative terminal of the LED to ground.

2. Measure the Output Voltage:

   - With the input voltage set to 9V, use the multimeter to measure the voltage at the output pin of the regulator. It should read approximately 5V, which is the regulated output.

3. Vary the Input Voltage:

   - Variable power supply, gradually increase or decrease the input voltage from around 7V up to 12V. vary the input.
   - Observe the output voltage with the multimeter as you change the input voltage. Despite the changes in the input, the output voltage should remain steady at around 5V.

4. Test with a Load:

   - Connect the LED with the series resistor to the output of the voltage regulator. The LED should light up consistently, demonstrating that the voltage regulator is providing a stable voltage to power the LED, regardless of changes in the input voltage.

This experiment illustrates how a voltage regulator works to maintain a constant output voltage even when the input voltage fluctuates. The 7805 regulator ensures that the output stays at 5V, protecting sensitive components like the LED from variations in power supply. In electronics, consistent voltage is needed to ensure the reliable operation of circuits. The experiment provides a demonstration of the voltage regulatorâ€™s role in power management.

1. Voltage Stabilization:

Despite the varying input voltage, the LM7805 maintains a steady 5V output, demonstrating how it protects circuits from power supply fluctuations.

2. Dropout Voltage:

If you reduce the input voltage below about 7V, you'll see the point at which the regulator can no longer maintain its 5V output, illustrating the concept of dropout voltage.

3. Heat Dissipation:

The LM7805 may become warm during the experiment, especially at higher input voltages. This demonstrates that linear regulators dissipate excess power as heat.

This experiment demonstrates how voltage regulators work to provide a stable power supply, which is needed for the reliable operation of electronic circuits.
