Iron Box

Electrical energy is converted into heat energy. The surface of the iron box is heated when current passes through a resistive coil. This heat is used to iron clothes.

What is a resistive coil? What does it look like? Need an image.

A resistive coil is a coil of wire. It is designed to have electrical resistance, which converts electrical energy into heat energy when current flows through it. This is found in toasters, ovens and electric stoves.

Heater

Electrical energy is transformed into heat energy. The resistive heating element keeps the space in a room warm.

What is a resistive heating element? What does it look like? Need an image.

A resistive element in a heater converts electrical energy into heat. The high resistance of the resistive element opposes the current flow. This generates heat, which warms up the surrounding area.

Fan

Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy. The motor rotates the fan blades, this creates airflow.

Need an image.

Bulb

Electrical energy is transformed into light energy. The current flows through the filament to illuminate the area.

Need an image.

A filament in a bulb is a thin wire. It can withstand the high heat generated by the electrical current. The resistance to the current in the filament causes it to heat up to a high temperature. This results in glowing of the filament which we can see as visible light.

Door Bell

Electrical energy is converted to sound energy. The circuit activates a buzzer, this produces the ringing sound.

Need an image.

These devices we encounter in everyday life are examples of transforming one form of energy into another form of energy to perform useful function.

**Real-world examples of energy transformation:**

1. **Iron Box**: **Electrical energy** is converted into **heat energy** as current passes through a resistive coil, heating the surface for ironing clothes.

2. **Heater**: **Electrical energy** is transformed into **heat energy** via a resistive heating element to warm a space.

3. **Fan**: **Electrical energy** converts to **mechanical energy** as the motor drives the fan blades, creating airflow.

4. **Bulb**: **Electrical energy** is transformed into **light energy** (with some heat) as current flows through the filament or LED, illuminating the area.

5. **Fridge**: **Electrical energy** powers a compressor, which transfers **thermal energy** from inside to outside the fridge, keeping food cool.

6. **Door Bell**: **Electrical energy** is converted to **sound energy** as the circuit activates an electromagnet or buzzer, producing the ringing sound.

These everyday devices demonstrate how energy is transformed from one form to another to perform useful tasks.
