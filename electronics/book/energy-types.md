Iron Box

Electrical energy is converted into heat energy. The surface of the iron box is heated when current passes through a resistive coil. This heat is used to iron clothes.

What is a resistive coil? What does it look like? Need an image.

A resistive coil is a coil of wire. It is designed to have electrical resistance, which converts electrical energy into heat energy when current flows through it. This is found in toasters, ovens and electric stoves.

Heater

Electrical energy is transformed into heat energy. The resistive heating element keeps the space in a room warm.

What is a resistive heating element? What does it look like? Need an image.

A resistive element in a heater converts electrical energy into heat. The high resistance of the resistive element opposes the current flow. This generates heat, which warms up the surrounding area.

Fan

Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy. The motor rotates the fan blades, this creates airflow.

Bulb

Electrical energy is transformed into light energy. The current flows through the filament to illuminate the area.

Need an image.

A filament in a bulb is a thin wire. It can withstand the high heat generated by the electrical current. The resistance to the current in the filament causes it to heat up to a high temperature. This results in glowing of the filament which we can see as visible light.

Door Bell

Electrical energy is converted to sound energy. The circuit activates a buzzer, this produces the ringing sound.

These devices we encounter in everyday life are examples of transforming one form of energy into another form of energy to perform useful function.


# Filament

A **filament** in a bulb is a thin wire, usually made of tungsten, that produces light when electricity passes through it.

Tungsten is used for filaments because it has a high melting point (over 3,400°C) and can withstand the intense heat generated by the electrical current.

When current flows through the filament, its resistance to the current causes it to heat up to a high temperature. At such high temperatures, the filament glows, emitting visible light. This process is called *incandescence*.

The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb that’s either vacuum-sealed or filled with an inert gas, like argon or nitrogen, to prevent the tungsten from burning out quickly due to oxidation.

**Real-world examples of energy transformation:**

1. **Iron Box**: **Electrical energy** is converted into **heat energy** as current passes through a resistive coil, heating the surface for ironing clothes.

2. **Heater**: **Electrical energy** is transformed into **heat energy** via a resistive heating element to warm a space.

3. **Fan**: **Electrical energy** converts to **mechanical energy** as the motor drives the fan blades, creating airflow.

4. **Bulb**: **Electrical energy** is transformed into **light energy** (with some heat) as current flows through the filament or LED, illuminating the area.

5. **Fridge**: **Electrical energy** powers a compressor, which transfers **thermal energy** from inside to outside the fridge, keeping food cool.

6. **Door Bell**: **Electrical energy** is converted to **sound energy** as the circuit activates an electromagnet or buzzer, producing the ringing sound.


These everyday devices demonstrate how energy is transformed from one form to another to perform useful tasks.


### Function in a Bulb
The filament is the primary light-producing component in incandescent bulbs. Its high resistance converts electrical energy into both heat and light energy, creating the familiar warm glow.
