Explain these every day things and how it transfers one form of energy to another form. Be concise. Start the response with: Real world examples 


**Real-world examples of energy transformation:**

1. **Iron Box**: **Electrical energy** is converted into **heat energy** as current passes through a resistive coil, heating the surface for ironing clothes.

2. **Heater**: **Electrical energy** is transformed into **heat energy** via a resistive heating element to warm a space.

3. **Fan**: **Electrical energy** converts to **mechanical energy** as the motor drives the fan blades, creating airflow.

4. **Bulb**: **Electrical energy** is transformed into **light energy** (with some heat) as current flows through the filament or LED, illuminating the area.

5. **Fridge**: **Electrical energy** powers a compressor, which transfers **thermal energy** from inside to outside the fridge, keeping food cool.

6. **Door Bell**: **Electrical energy** is converted to **sound energy** as the circuit activates an electromagnet or buzzer, producing the ringing sound.

These everyday devices demonstrate how energy is transformed from one form to another to perform practical tasks.
