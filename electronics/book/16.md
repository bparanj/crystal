Step 6

Connect the Anode of the LED to the postive power rails of the breadboard. This is the red wire from j12 of the breadboard to the postive terminal.

Step 11

Connect the resistor to b11 in the breadboard and the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. Connect the multimeter before the resistor by connecting the positive and negative terminals to f11 and e11 in the breadboard.
