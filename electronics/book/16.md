Current Controller

This experiment demonstrates that the current before and after a resistor is the same.

Water analogy for resistor gives the wrong impression that the valve is equivalent to resistor. Amount of water before the valve is not the same as after the value. The valve does not behave the same way a resistor. They are not equivalent. Because resistors are designed to dissipate heat energy to reduce the electrical energy. You cannot destroy any form of energy. If you have to reduce the electrical energy, some of the electrical energy must be transformed to some other form of energy. In this case, it is heat energy. This is considered as a waste because the heat energy is not used to perform any useful work.

Step 11

Connect the resistor to b11 in the breadboard and the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. Connect the multimeter before the resistor by connecting the positive and negative terminals to f11 and e11 in the breadboard.

Step 12

Run the simulation. The LED is on. The current through the circuit is the same as before: 7.04 mA.

Review and condense

Using a resistor to limit current in the circuit prevents excessive current that could damage the LED.

By placing the multimeter in series with the LED and resistor, it allows current measurement through the LED. The experiment shows that moving components or the measurement point in a series circuit does not change the current value, reinforcing the concept of uniform current in a series circuit.
