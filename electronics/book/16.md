This experiment demonstrates concepts such as circuit construction on a breadboard, current flow, use of a multimeter, and effect of component placement.

Connecting the LED illustrates the importance of polarity with components like LEDs. LEDs are polarized devices, meaning the anode (positive side) and cathode (negative side) must be connected correctly to function.

The LED lights up only when current flows in the correct direction, showing the principle of forward-biasing in diodes.

Using a resistor to limit current in the circuit prevents excessive current that could damage the LED.

This demonstrates Ohm’s Law (\( V = IR \)) and the role of resistors in controlling current in a circuit.

The experiment involves setting up a multimeter to measure current in the circuit. By placing the multimeter in series with the LED and resistor, it allows current measurement through the LED.

The setup illustrates how to properly place a multimeter in series for current measurements and emphasizes the importance of correct multimeter settings.

Repositioning the multimeter and resistor demonstrates that the series connection maintains the same current throughout the circuit, as expected from the series circuit rule.

This confirms that current in a series circuit remains consistent, reinforcing Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL), where the current entering and leaving a series loop remains the same.

The experiment shows that moving components or the measurement point in a series circuit does not change the current value, reinforcing the concept of uniform current in a series circuit.

This experiment provides hands-on learning of basic circuit construction, component connections, polarity, current measurement, and series circuit behavior. It highlights foundational principles such as Ohm’s Law, KCL, and the proper use of tools and components in circuit prototyping.
