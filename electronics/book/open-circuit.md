Correct. In an open circuit, thereâ€™s a break in the path that prevents current from flowing. Since current flow is essential for transferring energy and powering components, an open circuit cannot do any useful work.

**Key points:**
- **Current Flow**: For any work to be done (like lighting a bulb or powering a motor), there must be a complete path for current to flow from the power source, through the load, and back.
- **Open Circuit Condition**: In an open circuit, the current path is interrupted, so no electrons move through the circuit.
- **Useful Work**: Since no energy is delivered to the components in an open circuit, they cannot perform any function or output.

In short, a closed circuit is necessary to transfer energy and accomplish work.
