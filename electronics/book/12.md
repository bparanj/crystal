Voltage Divider

PENDING

Refer the diagrams in voltage-divider folder and complete this document.

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Image 1

Step 2

Take a resistor with value 1k ohm.

Terminal 1 of the resistor is connected to i6 and terminal 2 of the resistor is connected to i10.

Image 2

Step 3

Take resistor with value 2k. Connect the second resistor in series with the first resistor. The terminal 1 of the second resistor is connected to h10 and the terminal 2 of the scond resistor is connected to h14.

Step 4

Connect the Anode of the LED to f14. The LED is in series after the second resistor.

Image 5

The Cathode of the LED is connected to f15.

Image 6

Step 5

The Cathode of the LED is connected to the negative terminal of the breadboard. This is the black wire that connects f15 to the negative terminal of the battery.

Step 6

Take a 9 volt battery.

Image 8


Step 7

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Image 9


Step 8

Connect the postive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Image 10


Step 9

Connect the positiver terminal in the power rails of the breadboard to j6. This is the red wire.

Image 11


Step 10

Run the simulation. The LED will turn on.

Image 12


Step 11

Take a multimeter. It should be in Volt setting.

Image 13


Step 12

Connect the negative terminal of the multimeter to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Image 14


Step 13

Connect the positiver terminal of the multimeter to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Image 15


Step 14

Run the simulation. The LED turns on. The voltage reading shows 9 volt is supplied to the entire circuit. Stop the simulation.

Image 16


Step 15

Connect the negative terminal of the multimeter to the first terminal of the first resistor. Connect the positive terminal of the multimeter to the second terminal of the first resistor. Since resistor does not have polarity. The resistor value reading will be the same. Resistor values are read when there is no current in the circuit.

Image 17

Step 16

The reading shows negative 2.37 volts. We stick to positive voltages in DC circuit.

Image 18

Step 17

Let us switch the terminals of the multimeter across the first resistor.

Image 19.


Step 18

Run the simulation. The LED is on and we see the postive 2.37 volts across the first resistor.

Image 20


Step 19

Connect the multimeter to the second resistor.

Image 21


Step 20

Run the simulation. You can see the voltage reads: 4.75 volts.

Image 22


Step 21

Connect the multimeter across the LED. Positive terminal of the multimeter is connected to the Anode of the LED.

Image 23

The negative terminal is connected to the Cathode of the LED.

Image 24


Step 22

Run the simulation. The multimeter shows the voltage drop across the LED is 1.87 volts.

Image 25


Step 23

Lets add the readings:

2.37 + 4.75 + 1.87 = 8.99 volts

You can see the measurement is not 100% accurate. It is almost equal to the voltage supplied by the battery, which is 9 volts.

Step 24

Stop the simulation.

Image 26


Step 25

Change the multimeter reading to ohms.

Image 27


Step 26

Connect the terminals of the multimeter to the first resistor to measure the resistance.

Image 28


Step 27

Run the simulation. The first resistor value is 1 k ohm.

Image 29


Step 28

Connect the terminals of the multimeter to the second resistor to measure the resistance.

Image 30


Step 29

Run the simulation. The second resistor value is 2 k ohm.

Image 31


Step 30

Connect the terminals of the multimeter to the LED.

Image 32


Step 31

Run the simulation. The resistance of LED is negligible. So it does not show any reading.

Image 33


Step 32

Make the first resistor value as 2 ohm resistor.

Image 34


Step 33

The voltage drop across the LED is 1.95 volts.

Image 35


Step 34

The voltage drop across the second resistor is 14 m volts.

Image 36


Step 35

The voltage drop across the first resistor is 7.02 volts.

Image 38


Step 36

If we add these three values: 1.95 + 7.02 + 0.014 =  8.984 volts. This is approximately equal to the power source value of 9 volts.
