A basic voltage divider consists of two resistors connected in series across a voltage source, with the output voltage taken from the connection point between the two resistors.

1) Get two resistors (e.g., 1kΩ and 2kΩ) and a 9V battery.
2) Connect the resistors in series:
 			attach one end of the 1kΩ resistor to the positive terminal of the battery.
3) Connect the other end of the 1kΩ resistor to one end of the 2kΩ resistor.
4) Connect the free end of the 2kΩ resistor to the negative terminal of the battery.
5) The voltage divider output is the point between the two resistors. Measure the voltage at this point with respect to the negative battery terminal.

You should observe a voltage of approximately 6V, which is 2/3 of the input voltage, as the 2kΩ resistor is 2/3 of the total resistance.

A simple voltage division circuit is a fundamental electronic circuit that uses two resistors to create a lower voltage from a higher voltage source.

 1. The input voltage (Vin) is split across the two resistors

The relationship between Vin and Vout is given by the formula:

Vout = Vin * (R2 / (R1 + R2))

 1. The ratio of R1 to R2 determines the output voltage
 2. Changing the resistor values changes the output voltage
 3. The total current through both resistors remains constant
 4. This circuit is most effective when the load impedance is much higher than R2

Applications:

 1. Reducing voltage for sensors or low-voltage components
 2. Creating reference voltages
 3. Level shifting in signal processing
 4. Biasing in amplifier circuits

This simple circuit is the basis for many more complex voltage division applications in electronics.

To demonstrate how voltage decreases across components in a series circuit, illustrating the concept of voltage drop.

Use the multimeter to measure the total voltage across the two resistors. Place the multimeter probes across the positive terminal of the battery and the connection point between the second resistor and the negative terminal. Record this voltage, which should be approximately 9V.

Measure the voltage drop across the first resistor (100 ohms). Place one probe of the multimeter on the positive terminal of the battery and the other probe on the junction between the two resistors. Record the voltage drop.

Measure the voltage drop across the second resistor (200 ohms). Place one probe on the junction between the two resistors and the other probe on the negative terminal of the battery. Record this voltage drop.

Observe how the voltage drops across each resistor add up to the total voltage of the battery. Notice that the voltage drop across the 200-ohm resistor is higher than the voltage drop across the 100-ohm resistor. This demonstrates that the voltage drop is proportional to the resistance in a series circuit.

This experiment illustrates the concept of voltage drop in a simple series circuit. When resistors are connected in series, the total voltage supplied by the battery is divided among the resistors. The voltage drop across each resistor depends on its resistance, following Ohm’s Law (\( V = IR \)). The resistor with higher resistance (200 ohms) has a greater voltage drop compared to the resistor with lower resistance (100 ohms). This shows how voltage is used up as current flows through resistive elements in a circuit. The total voltage drop across all components in a series circuit will always equal the supply voltage.

Image 16

Step 15

Connect the negative terminal of the multimeter to the first terminal of the first resistor. Connect the positive terminal of the multimeter to the second terminal of the first resistor. Since resistor does not have polarity. The resistor value reading will be the same. Resistor values are read when there is no current in the circuit.

Step 36

If we add these three values: 1.95 + 7.02 + 0.014 =  8.984 volts. This is approximately equal to the power source value of 9 volts.

Two resistors are connected in series to create a voltage divider. This setup divides the total voltage of the battery (9V) across each resistor, with each resistor receiving a portion of the total voltage proportional to its resistance.

By placing a multimeter across each component, you can see that the total voltage supplied by the battery is distributed among the components in series. The sum of individual voltage drops approximately equals the total voltage (9V).

The LED has a specific forward voltage drop (about 1.87V in this setup). This drop is consistent with the LED’s characteristics, demonstrating that different components have different voltage requirements.

When resistor values are changed, the voltage drop across each component changes accordingly. This demonstrates how adjusting resistor values in a voltage divider affects the voltage distribution across the circuit.

The experiment includes measuring both voltage and resistance using a multimeter, showing how to verify component values and voltage drops across each component in a circuit.

This illustrates the concept of a voltage divider, voltage distribution in a series circuit, and how different resistance values affect voltage drops. It reinforces the use of basic measurement tools and the fundamental principle that the sum of voltage drops in a series circuit equals the total supply voltage.
