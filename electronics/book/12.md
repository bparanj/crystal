Image 14

Step 13

Image 16

Step 15

Connect the negative terminal of the multimeter to the first terminal of the first resistor. Connect the positive terminal of the multimeter to the second terminal of the first resistor. Since resistor does not have polarity. The resistor value reading will be the same. Resistor values are read when there is no current in the circuit.

Step 16

The reading shows negative 2.37 volts. We stick to positive voltages in DC circuit.

Image 18

Step 17

Let us switch the terminals of the multimeter across the first resistor.

Step 18

Run the simulation. The LED is on and we see the postive 2.37 volts across the first resistor.

Step 22

Run the simulation. The multimeter shows the voltage drop across the LED is 1.87 volts.

Image 25

Step 23

Lets add the readings:

2.37 + 4.75 + 1.87 = 8.99 volts

You can see the measurement is not 100% accurate. It is almost equal to the voltage supplied by the battery, which is 9 volts.

Step 24

Stop the simulation.

Step 25

Change the multimeter reading to ohms.

Image 27

Step 26

Step 29

Run the simulation. The second resistor value is 2 k ohm.

Image 31

Step 30

Connect the terminals of the multimeter to the LED.

Image 32

Step 31

Run the simulation. The resistance of LED is negligible. So it does not show any reading.

Image 33

Step 32

Make the first resistor value as 2 ohm resistor.

Image 34

Step 33

The voltage drop across the LED is 1.95 volts.

Image 35

Step 34

The voltage drop across the second resistor is 14 m volts.

Image 36

Step 35

The voltage drop across the first resistor is 7.02 volts.

Review and condense:

If we add these three values: 1.95 + 7.02 + 0.014 =  8.984 volts. This is approximately equal to the power source value of 9 volts.

What is a voltage divider circuit?

A voltage division circuit is a basic electronic circuit that uses two resistors to create a lower voltage from a higher voltage source.

Two resistors are connected in series to create a voltage divider. This setup divides the total voltage of the battery (9V) across each resistor, with each resistor receiving a portion of the total voltage proportional to its resistance.

What is the voltage across the resistors?

By placing a multimeter across each component, you can see that the total voltage supplied by the battery is distributed among the components in series. The sum of individual voltage drops approximately equals the total voltage (9V).

Forward voltage drop of LED

The LED has a specific forward voltage drop (about 1.87V in this setup). This drop is consistent with the LED’s characteristics, demonstrating that different components have different voltage requirements.

What happens when resistor values are changed?

When resistor values are changed, the voltage drop across each component changes accordingly. This demonstrates how adjusting resistor values in a voltage divider affects the voltage distribution across the circuit.

What does it demonstrate?

This demonstrates the concept of a voltage divider, voltage distribution in a series circuit, and how different resistance values affect voltage drops. It reinforces the use of basic measurement tools and the fundamental principle that the sum of voltage drops in a series circuit equals the total supply voltage.

Voltage divider output?

The voltage divider output is the point between the two resistors. Measure the voltage at this point with respect to the negative battery terminal.

You should observe a voltage of approximately 6V, which is 2/3 of the input voltage, as the 2kΩ resistor is 2/3 of the total resistance.

1. The input voltage (Vin) is split across the two resistors

The relationship between Vin and Vout is given by the formula:

Vout = Vin  (R2 / (R1 + R2))

 1. The ratio of R1 to R2 determines the output voltage
 2. Changing the resistor values changes the output voltage
 3. The total current through both resistors remains constant
 4. This circuit is most effective when the load impedance is much higher than R2

Applications:

 1. Reducing voltage for sensors or low-voltage components
 2. Creating reference voltages
 3. Level shifting in signal processing
 4. Biasing in amplifier circuits

This simple circuit is the basic building block for many complex voltage division applications in electronics.

This experiment demonstrates the concept of voltage drop in a simple series circuit. When resistors are connected in series, the total voltage supplied by the battery is divided among the resistors. The voltage drop across each resistor depends on its resistance, following Ohm’s Law (\( V = IR \)). The resistor with higher resistance (200 ohms) has a greater voltage drop compared to the resistor with lower resistance (100 ohms). This shows how voltage is used up as current flows through resistive elements in a circuit. The total voltage drop across all components in a series circuit will always equal the supply voltage.

This experiment will show that voltage divides according to the resistance values in series.

To demonstrate that voltage divides across resistors in a series circuit based on their resistance values, with higher resistance getting a higher voltage drop.


2. Create a Series Circuit with Two Resistors:
   - Connect the 1 kΩ resistor in series with the 3 kΩ resistor.
   - Connect one end of the 1 kΩ resistor to the positive rail.
   - Connect the free end of the 3 kΩ resistor to the ground rail.

3. Measure Voltage Across Each Resistor:
   - Use a multimeter in Tinkercad to measure the voltage drop across each resistor.
   - You should see that the larger resistor (3 kΩ) has a higher voltage drop across it than the smaller resistor (1 kΩ) because voltage divides proportionally to resistance in a series circuit.

4. Optional: Add LEDs to Visualize Voltage Drops:
   - Place an LED across each resistor (with appropriate current-limiting resistors if needed).
   - The LED across the larger resistor (3 kΩ) will appear dimmer than the LED across the smaller resistor (1 kΩ), reflecting the difference in voltage drops.

In a series circuit, the total voltage is divided across each resistor in proportion to its resistance. This experiment shows that higher resistance components in series receive a higher share of the total voltage, just like how the "path of least resistance" experiment shows that more current flows through a path with less resistance.
