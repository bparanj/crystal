A capacitor is an electronic component that can become a short-circuit when it fails.

In a normal state, a capacitor blocks DC current after charging and allows AC to pass, acting as an insulator for direct current. However, when a capacitor fails, particularly through dielectric breakdown, it can lose its insulating property and create a low-resistance path between its terminals. This failure effectively short-circuits the capacitor, allowing current to flow freely where it should be blocked, potentially damaging other components in the circuit.

Other components, such as transistors and diodes, can also fail as a short-circuit in certain conditions, but capacitors are commonly known for this type of failure mode.

A resistor commonly becomes an open-circuit when it fails.

In normal operation, a resistor provides a specific resistance to limit current flow. However, due to factors like excessive heat or mechanical stress, the resistor can break or burn out, creating an open circuit. When this happens, it stops conducting entirely, and current can no longer flow through it.

Other components, such as fuses, inductors, and certain semiconductors (e.g., transistors), can also fail as open circuits under specific conditions. However, resistors are frequently associated with open-circuit failures in electronics.
