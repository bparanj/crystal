An experiment to demonstrate that a polarized capacitor will be damaged when connected to an AC source:

To show that a polarized capacitor is not suitable for AC sources due to the reversing polarity.

In real life, it would leak, fail, or even explode.

- Polarized capacitors are designed for DC circuits where the polarity does not reverse.
- In an AC circuit, the voltage alternates between positive and negative, causing the capacitor to experience reverse bias during half of the cycle.
- This reverse voltage damages the internal structure of the capacitor, leading to overheating, leakage, or failure.

This experiment is safe to simulate in Tinkercad, but do not replicate it in real life without proper safety precautions. Capacitors can rupture when subjected to reverse voltage.
