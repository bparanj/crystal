An experiment in Tinkercad to demonstrate that a polarized capacitor will be damaged when connected to an AC source:

### Objective

To show that a polarized capacitor is not suitable for AC sources due to the reversing polarity, which causes damage.

### Components

- AC Voltage Source (5V peak-to-peak, sine wave, DC Offset 0)
- Polarized Capacitor (10 µF, 16V rated)
- Resistor (1 kΩ) to limit current
- Breadboard

### Steps

- Connect the positive terminal of the AC source to one terminal of the resistor.
- Connect the other terminal of the resistor to the positive terminal of the polarized capacitor.
- Connect the negative terminal of the capacitor to the negative terminal of the AC source.

5. Run the Simulation:
   - Set the AC voltage source to 5V peak-to-peak at a frequency of 1 Hz (low frequency makes the polarity reversal easier to observe).
   - Observe the behavior of the capacitor:
     - The capacitor will heat up (if simulated correctly).
     - In real life, it would leak, fail, or even explode.

### Why the Capacitor Fails

- Polarized capacitors (e.g., electrolytic capacitors) are designed for DC circuits where the polarity does not reverse.
- In an AC circuit, the voltage alternates between positive and negative, causing the capacitor to experience reverse bias during half of the cycle.
- This reverse voltage damages the internal structure of the capacitor, leading to overheating, leakage, or failure.

### Safety Note

This experiment is safe to simulate in Tinkercad, but do not replicate it in real life without proper safety precautions. Capacitors can rupture when subjected to reverse voltage.
