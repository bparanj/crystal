### High-Pass Filter Using Resistor and Inductor

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of a high-pass filter using a resistor and an inductor. The filter blocks low frequencies and passes high frequencies.

### Components
1. Inductor: 10 mH
2. Resistor: \(1 \, \text{k}\Omega\)
3. Function Generator (AC Source)
4. Oscilloscope (to observe input and output signals)
5. Breadboard
6. Jumper Wires

### Steps

1. Place Components on the Breadboard:
   - Place the inductor and resistor on the breadboard.

2. Connect the Resistor and Inductor in Series:
   - Connect one terminal of the inductor to one terminal of the resistor.
   - This series connection forms the filter.

3. Input Connection (Function Generator):
   - Connect the positive terminal of the function generator to the free terminal of the inductor.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the function generator to the breadboard's ground rail.

4. Output Connection (Oscilloscope):
   - Connect the positive terminal of the oscilloscope to the junction of the resistor and inductor.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the oscilloscope to the ground rail.

5. Ground Connection:
   - Ensure the ground of the function generator and oscilloscope are connected to the same ground rail.


### Function Generator Settings

1. Waveform: Sine wave.
2. Amplitude: \(5 \, \text{V}_{\text{peak-to-peak}}\).
3. Frequency Sweep: Start at \(10 \, \text{Hz}\), gradually increase to \(10 \, \text{kHz}\).

### Procedure

1. Run the Simulation:
   - Observe the input and output signals on the oscilloscope at different frequencies.

2. Low-Frequency Behavior:
   - At low frequencies (e.g., \(10 \, \text{Hz}\)), the inductor passes most of the current, causing the output voltage across the resistor to drop.

3. High-Frequency Behavior:
   - At high frequencies (e.g., \(10 \, \text{kHz}\)), the inductor blocks the current due to increased inductive reactance, and the output voltage across the resistor approaches the input voltage.

### Observations

- Low Frequencies: The output voltage is near zero.
- High Frequencies: The output voltage matches the input.
- Cutoff Frequency: Use \(f_c = \frac{R}{2 \pi L}\) to determine the transition point.


### Results

This setup allows you to observe how the resistor-inductor high-pass filter behaves, passing high frequencies and attenuating low frequencies, effectively demonstrating its functionality in Tinkercad.
