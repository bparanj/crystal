1. Open vs. Closed Circuits:

A slide switch toggles between open (no current) and closed (current flows) circuits. When the switch is open there is no current flowing through the circuit. When it is closed the current flows through the circuit.

Slide Switch

Demonstrate the use of slide switch to control the flow of current through a circuit.

Components

1. 9 volt battery
2. Slideswitch
3. Red LED
4. Resistor with 1 k ohm value

Tinkercad Experiment

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery.

Image 2

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect a slideswitch to the section B of the breadboard.

Step 5

Connect the middle pin of the slideswitch to the section C of the breadboard.

What is the middle pin?

Step 6

Connect the red LED to the section C of the breadboard. The Cathode of the LED connects to the middle pin of the slidswitch.

Step 7

The Anode of the LED connects to one end of the resistor. The other end of the resistor is connected to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 8

The positive terminal of the battery connects to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 9

The positive terminal of the breadboard connects to the first pin of the slideswitch. This completes the circuit. We now have a closed circuit. Current can flow through a closed circuit.

Step 10

Run the simulation. The red LED turns on.

Step 11

Press the slideswitch to turn it off. The red LED turns off.

You can see the closeup shot of the circuit connections to make the connections between the components easy to see. 

The terminal 1 of the resistor is connected to negative terminal of the breadboard.

The terminal 2 of the resistor is connected to b3.

The c4 terminal is the longer leg of the LED. This is the Anode. This is connected to the green wire that runs from e4 to g4.

Image anode

The shorter terminal of the LED is the Cathode. This is connected to c3. 

Image cathode

The middle terminal of the slideswitch is connected to h4. The first terminal of the slideswitch is connected to h3. The third terminal of the slideswitch is connected to h5. The positive terminal connection wire connects from positive terminal of the breadboard to j3 to connect to the first terminal of the slideswitch.

One end of the resistor is connected to b3. This is connected to c3 terminal of the smaller leg of the LED. 

### Key Takeaways

1. A slide switch acts as a simple on/off control for the circuit, allowing you to maintain the state (on or off) without holding the switch.

2. The middle pin of the slide switch is the output that determines the connection state, switching between two possible positions to control current flow.

3. Sliding the switch completes or interrupts the circuit, turning the LED on or off based on the switch position.

4. A 1 kÎ© resistor is used to limit current, ensuring the LED operates safely and is protected from overcurrent.

5. Slide switches provide a more stable and permanent state compared to pushbuttons, making them ideal for circuits where you want a set, stable control.
