1. Open vs. Closed Circuits:

A slide switch toggles between open (no current) and closed (current flows) circuits. When the switch is open there is no current flowing through the circuit. When it is closed the current flows through the circuit.

You can see the closeup shot of the circuit connections to make the connections between the components easy to see. 

The terminal 1 of the resistor is connected to negative terminal of the breadboard.

The c4 terminal is the longer leg of the LED. This is the Anode. This is connected to the green wire that runs from e4 to g4.

The shorter terminal of the LED is the Cathode. This is connected to c3.

The middle terminal of the slideswitch is connected to h4. The first terminal of the slideswitch is connected to h3. The third terminal of the slideswitch is connected to h5. The positive terminal connection wire connects from positive terminal of the breadboard to j3 to connect to the first terminal of the slideswitch.

One end of the resistor is connected to b3. This is connected to c3 terminal of the smaller leg of the LED. 

A slide switch acts as a simple on/off control for the circuit, allowing you to maintain the state (on or off) without holding the switch.

The middle pin of the slide switch is the output that determines the connection state, switching between two possible positions to control current flow.

Sliding the switch completes or interrupts the circuit, turning the LED on or off based on the switch position.

A 1 kΩ resistor is used to limit current, ensuring the LED operates safely and is protected from overcurrent.

Slide switches provide a more stable and permanent state compared to pushbuttons, making them ideal for circuits where you want a set, stable control.

This experiment demonstrates the use of a slide switch to control the flow of current through a circuit, effectively turning an LED on and off.

The slide switch is used to open and close the circuit, controlling the flow of current. When the switch is in the "on" position, the circuit is closed, allowing current to flow, and the LED lights up. When the switch is "off," the circuit opens, stopping the current and turning off the LED.

For the LED to turn on, there must be a closed circuit allowing current to flow from the battery through the switch, LED, resistor, and back to the battery.

Opening the circuit with the switch interrupts this path, demonstrating the role of a switch in controlling circuit functionality.

The 1 kΩ resistor limits the current through the LED, protecting it from excessive current and preventing damage.

This experiment highlights the slide switch's role in controlling current flow in a circuit, demonstrating the basic function of switching. It also reinforces the need for a current-limiting resistor in circuits with LEDs to ensure safe operation.
