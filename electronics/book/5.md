Slide Switch

Demonstrate the use of slide switch to control the flow of current through a circuit.

Components

1. 9 volt battery
2. Slideswitch
3. Red LED
4. Resistor with 1 k ohm value

Tinkercad Experiment

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect a slideswitch to the section B of the breadboard

Step 5

Connect the middle pin of the slideswitch to the section C of the breadboard.

What is the middle pin?

Step 6

Connect the red LED to the section C of the breadboard. The Cathode of the LED connects to the middle pin of the slidswitch.

Step 7

The Anode of the LED connects to one end of the resistor. The other end of the resistor is connected to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 8

The positive terminal of the battery connects to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 9

The positive terminal of the breadboard connects to the first pin of the slideswitch. This completes the circuit.

Step 10

Run the simulation. The red LED turns on.

Step 11

Press the slideswitch to turn it off. The red LED turns off.

You can see the closeup shot of the circuit connections to make the connections between the components easy to see.
