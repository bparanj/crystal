A simple experiment to demonstrate reactance in an inductor using Tinkercad involves creating a basic LC (inductor-capacitor) circuit. Here's a step-by-step guide to set it up:

1. **Create a New Circuit**:
   - Open Tinkercad and create a new circuit project.

2. **Add Components**:
   - Drag and drop the following components onto the workspace:
     - One inductor
     - One capacitor
     - One AC voltage source
     - Wires to connect the components
     - An oscilloscope (optional, for visualizing the reactance)

3. **Connect the Components**:
   - Connect the inductor and capacitor in series.
   - Connect the AC voltage source across the series LC circuit.
   - If using an oscilloscope, connect it across the inductor to observe the voltage changes.

4. **Set the AC Voltage Source**:
   - Set the frequency of the AC voltage source to a desired value (e.g., 1 kHz).

5. **Run the Simulation**:
   - Start the simulation to observe the behavior of the circuit.
   - You should see the voltage across the inductor change with the frequency of the AC source, demonstrating the concept of reactance.

This setup will help you visualize how the inductor's reactance varies with the frequency of the applied AC voltage. You can adjust the frequency to see how the reactance changes, which is a key characteristic of inductors.
