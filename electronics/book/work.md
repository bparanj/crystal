Let us consider the example of lifting an apple. Let us assume it weighs 100 grams. The force of gravity on the apple is approximately 1 newton because 1 newton is roughly the force needed to hold a 100-gram object.

When you lift the apple 1 meter straight up from the ground, the work done (in joules) to lift the apple is calculated as:

...

Lifting an apple 1 meter requires 1 joule of energy. 1 joule of energy is required to lift an apple weighing 100 grams 1 meter in the air.



## Lifting an Apple

Consider the example of lifting an **apple**.

### Example:
- A typical apple weighs about **100 grams** or **0.1 kg**.
- The force of gravity on the apple is approximately **1 newton** (because \( 1 \, \text{N} \) is roughly the force needed to hold a 100-gram object).

Now, imagine you lift the apple **1 meter** straight up from the ground.

### Work Done:
The **work done** (in joules) to lift the apple is calculated as:
\[
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} = 1 \, \text{newton} \times 1 \, \text{meter} = 1 \, \text{joule}
\]

### Simplified Explanation:
Lifting an apple **1 meter** requires **1 joule** of energy. In other words, **1 joule** is the amount of energy it takes to lift a small apple **1 meter** in the air.

This simple action makes the concept of a joule more tangible: it represents a small but real amount of work that can be easily visualized.


Let us consider moving a box that weighs 1 lb, what is the work done in lifting the box?

1 joule is defined as the amount of work done when a force of 1 newton moves an object 1 meter.

First, convert the weight of the box from pounds to newtons (N). 1 lb = 4.448 N. So 1 lb box exerts a force of approximately 4.448 newtons due to gravity.

If you lift the box 1 meter off the ground, the force required to lift this box is 4.448 newtons due to gravity. The work done in joules:

...

The following is still pending. reduce it.

## Carrying a Box

To explain the **joules** unit using the example of moving a box that weighs **1 lb**, we can relate it to the **work** done by the person in lifting the box.

### Understanding Joules:
- **1 joule** is defined as the amount of work done when a force of **1 newton** moves an object **1 meter**.
- Work is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Work} (Joules) = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}
  \]

### Converting Pounds to Newtons:
First, convert the weight of the box from pounds (lbs) to newtons (N), since 1 lb â‰ˆ 4.448 N. So, the **1 lb box** exerts a force of approximately **4.448 newtons** due to gravity.

### Example Scenario:
If the person lifts the box **1 meter** off the ground:
1. The force required to lift the box is **4.448 newtons** (the weight of the box).
2. The distance moved is **1 meter**.

The work done (in joules) is calculated as:
\[
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} = 4.448 \, \text{N} \times 1 \, \text{m} = 4.448 \, \text{joules}
\]

### Explanation:
In this case, the person performs **4.448 joules** of work to lift the 1 lb box **1 meter**. The unit **joules** measures the energy required to move the box a certain distance, where **1 joule** represents the energy needed to exert **1 newton** of force over **1 meter**. So, the higher the weight (force) or the greater the distance, the more joules of energy are required.

## Power and Work

In electronics, *power* and *work* are closely related through the concept of energy transfer.

1. **Work** refers to the energy transferred when a force acts over a distance. In electronics, this is the energy needed to move electric charges through a circuit.

2. **Power** is the rate at which this work is done, or energy is transferred. It's the amount of energy used per unit of time.

The relationship can be summarized with the formula:

\[
\text{Power (P)} = \frac{\text{Work (W)}}{\text{Time (t)}}
\]

In electrical terms, power (measured in watts) is calculated as:

\[
P = V \times I
\]

where:
- \( V \) is the voltage (potential difference),
- \( I \) is the current (flow of charge).

Here, voltage provides the energy (or work) per unit charge, and current indicates how many charges pass through per second. So, power measures how quickly energy (or work) is done in a circuit.
