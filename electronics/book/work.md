## Lifting an Apple

Consider the example of lifting an **apple**.

### Example:
- A typical apple weighs about **100 grams** or **0.1 kg**.
- The force of gravity on the apple is approximately **1 newton** (because \( 1 \, \text{N} \) is roughly the force needed to hold a 100-gram object).
  
Now, imagine you lift the apple **1 meter** straight up from the ground.

### Work Done:
The **work done** (in joules) to lift the apple is calculated as:
\[
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} = 1 \, \text{newton} \times 1 \, \text{meter} = 1 \, \text{joule}
\]

### Simplified Explanation:
Lifting an apple **1 meter** requires **1 joule** of energy. In other words, **1 joule** is the amount of energy it takes to lift a small apple **1 meter** in the air.

This simple action makes the concept of a joule more tangible: it represents a small but real amount of work that can be easily visualized.

## Carrying a Box

To explain the **joules** unit using the example of moving a box that weighs **1 lb**, we can relate it to the **work** done by the person in lifting the box.

### Understanding Joules:
- **1 joule** is defined as the amount of work done when a force of **1 newton** moves an object **1 meter**.
- Work is calculated as:  
  \[
  \text{Work} (Joules) = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}
  \]

### Converting Pounds to Newtons:
First, convert the weight of the box from pounds (lbs) to newtons (N), since 1 lb â‰ˆ 4.448 N. So, the **1 lb box** exerts a force of approximately **4.448 newtons** due to gravity.

### Example Scenario:
If the person lifts the box **1 meter** off the ground:
1. The force required to lift the box is **4.448 newtons** (the weight of the box).
2. The distance moved is **1 meter**.

The work done (in joules) is calculated as:
\[
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} = 4.448 \, \text{N} \times 1 \, \text{m} = 4.448 \, \text{joules}
\]

### Explanation:
In this case, the person performs **4.448 joules** of work to lift the 1 lb box **1 meter**. The unit **joules** measures the energy required to move the box a certain distance, where **1 joule** represents the energy needed to exert **1 newton** of force over **1 meter**. So, the higher the weight (force) or the greater the distance, the more joules of energy are required.
