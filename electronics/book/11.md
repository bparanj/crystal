Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery.

Image 2

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal from the battery to the negative power rails of the breadboard.

Step 4

Take a slidswitch. Connect it to the h10, h11 and h12 on the breadboard.

Step 5

The middle terminal of the slideswitch is the common terminal. 

Image 5

Take an inductor. 

Image 6

Connect one end of the inductor to common terminal of the slideswitch. This is the connection at g11. The other end of the inductor is connected to g15.

Step 6

Change the inductor value to 6 Henry.

This is a high value for inductor. We are using it to make it easy to observe the use of inductor in a basic circuit. 

Step 7

Take a LED. Anode of the LED is connected to c15. Cathode of the LED is connected to c14.

Step 8

Connect the inductor to the Anode of the LED. This is the green wire from f15 to c15.

Step 9

Connect one end of the 1 k ohm resitor to the Cathode of the LED. 

Image 11

The other end of the resistor to the negative terminal of the power rails of the breadboard. This is the connection from b14 to the negative terminal.

Step 10

Connect the postive terminal of the 9 volt battery to the positive power rails of the breadboard.

Image 12

Step 11

Connect the Terminal 1 of the slideswitch to the postive terminal in the power rails of the breadboard.

Step 12

Run the simulation. Turn on the slideswitch. The LED will turn ON.

Step 13

Turn off slideswitch. You can see the LED is still on but the brightness is lower when the switch was on. The circuit was closed when the switch was on. When we turn off the switch, we have a open circuit. It might be a surprise to see the LED is on when the circuit is open.

Within a few seconds the LED slowly fades and turns off.
