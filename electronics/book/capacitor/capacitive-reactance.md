Capacitive reactance is the opposition that a capacitor offers to alternating current (AC) in a circuit. It depends on the frequency of the AC signal and the capacitance of the capacitor.

### Formula:

\[
X_C = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}
\]
where:
- \( X_C \) is the capacitive reactance (measured in ohms),
- \( f \) is the frequency of the AC signal,
- \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor.

### Explanation:

- Inversely Proportional: Capacitive reactance decreases as frequency or capacitance increases. This means high-frequency signals pass through a capacitor more easily than low-frequency signals.

- AC vs. DC: In DC circuits (where \( f = 0 \)), capacitive reactance is infinite, effectively blocking current. In AC circuits, the capacitor allows current to flow based on the reactance value.

Capacitive reactance plays a role in controlling AC current flow in circuits with capacitors.

Why does high-frequency signals pass through a capacitor more easily than low-frequency ones?

High-frequency signals pass through a capacitor more easily than low-frequency ones due to the capacitive reactance property of the capacitor. Capacitive reactance is the opposition that a capacitor provides to an AC signal, and it depends on the frequency of the signal:

\[
X_C = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}
\]

Where:
- \( X_C \) is the capacitive reactance (in ohms, Î©).
- \( f \) is the frequency of the signal (in hertz, Hz).
- \( C \) is the capacitance (in farads, F).

Inverse Relationship: Capacitive reactance (\(X_C\)) is inversely proportional to frequency (\(f\)). As the frequency increases, \( X_C \) decreases, allowing more current to pass.

Low Reactance at High Frequency:

For high-frequency signals, \( X_C \) becomes very low, effectively making the capacitor behave more like a short circuit, allowing the signal to pass through easily.

High Reactance at Low Frequency:

For low-frequency signals, \( X_C \) is high, acting more like an open circuit, which blocks or attenuates the low-frequency components.

This frequency-dependent behavior makes capacitors useful for filtering applications, where they block DC or low-frequency signals while allowing high-frequency AC signals to pass through.
