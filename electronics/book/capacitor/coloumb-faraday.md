A Coulomb is a unit of electric charge, while a Faraday is a unit of electric charge related to the amount of charge carried by one mole of electrons.

One Faraday equals the charge of approximately 6.022 x 10²³ electrons, or about 96,485 Coulombs. This is rooted in Avogadro's number, which quantifies the number of entities (atoms, molecules, electrons) in one mole. So, while Coulombs and Faradays aren't identical, they are related units in the realm of electric charge.

A Coulomb measures the amount of electric charge, while a Faraday is a specific quantity of that charge based on Avogadro's number. They're different units, but both are in the same "currency" of electric charge. Just like cents and dollars, one is a base unit (Coulomb), and the other is a larger, specific quantity (Faraday).
