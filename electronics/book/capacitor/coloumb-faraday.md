A Coulomb is a unit of electric charge, while a Faraday is a unit of electric charge related to the amount of charge carried by one mole of electrons.

One Faraday equals the charge of approximately 6.022 x 10²³ electrons, or about 96,485 Coulombs. This is rooted in Avogadro's number, which quantifies the number of entities (atoms, molecules, electrons) in one mole. So, while Coulombs and Faradays aren't identical, they are related units in the realm of electric charge.

A Coulomb measures the amount of electric charge, while a Faraday is a specific quantity of that charge based on Avogadro's number. They're different units, but both are in the same "currency" of electric charge. Just like cents and dollars, one is a base unit (Coulomb), and the other is a larger, specific quantity (Faraday).

The unit of capacitance is the **farad (F)**. The farad is named after Michael Faraday, a pioneering scientist in electromagnetism and electrochemistry.

Here's why we use the farad for capacitance instead of the coulomb:

- **Capacitance Definition**: Capacitance is defined as the ability of a system to store an electric charge per unit voltage. Mathematically, it's given by \( C = \frac{Q}{V} \), where \( C \) is the capacitance in farads, \( Q \) is the charge in coulombs, and \( V \) is the voltage in volts.
- **Farad**: One farad is the capacitance of a capacitor that stores one coulomb of charge with a potential difference of one volt across its plates. This unit directly relates the charge and voltage, making it a natural choice for measuring capacitance.
- **Coulomb**: While the coulomb measures electric charge, it doesn't account for the relationship between charge and voltage, which is essential for defining capacitance.

In summary, the farad is used because it directly relates to how capacitors function, storing charge relative to the voltage applied. The coulomb, on the other hand, is a measure of charge itself and is used in various contexts beyond just capacitance.
