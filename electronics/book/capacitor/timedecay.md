You can measure the voltage across the capacitor with a multimeter to see it decrease over time.
It discharges quickly at first, then more slowly.

The time constant (τ) of this circuit is R  C = 1kΩ  100µF = 0.1 seconds.

- Revise this experiment by removing the LED and only showing how the voltage reduces gradually when switch it turned off to cut off power. Measure the multimeter to show the voltage over time.
- Use a power supply that can vary the voltage and current. Makes the above item easier to demonstrate.
- Real experiment will show that LED will be on when you remove the power source from the circuit.
- Hand draw the capacitor circuit and scan it.
- It takes about 5 time constants (0.5 seconds) to fully charge or discharge the capacitor. I don't think this is true. Run the experiment and check.

The experiment shows how the capacitor's voltage decays over time when it’s disconnected from the power source, a characteristic of capacitor discharge in RC circuits.
