A simple experiment to demonstrate the time decay in a capacitor using Tinkercad involves creating an RC (resistor-capacitor) circuit. Here's a step-by-step guide to set it up:

Run

### Components Needed:
- Breadboard
- Resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ)
- Capacitor (e.g., 100 µF)
- Battery (e.g., 9V)
- Switch
- Wires
- Multimeter (to measure voltage)

### Steps:

1. **Set Up the Circuit**:
   - Place the resistor and capacitor in series on the breadboard.
   - Connect one end of the resistor to the positive terminal of the battery.
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to one terminal of the capacitor.
   - Connect the other terminal of the capacitor to the negative terminal of the battery.
   - Place a switch between the battery and the resistor to control the charging and discharging process.

2. **Charging the Capacitor**:
   - Close the switch to allow current to flow from the battery through the resistor to the capacitor.
   - The capacitor will start charging, and you can observe the voltage across the capacitor increasing over time using the multimeter.

3. **Discharging the Capacitor**:
   - Open the switch to stop the charging process.
   - Connect a wire across the capacitor terminals to create a discharge path through the resistor.
   - Observe the voltage across the capacitor decreasing over time using the multimeter.

### Observations:
- When the switch is closed, the voltage across the capacitor will rise exponentially until it reaches the battery voltage.
- When the switch is opened and the capacitor is allowed to discharge, the voltage will decay exponentially.

### Explanation:
The time it takes for the voltage to decay is characterized by the time constant \(\tau\), which is the product of the resistance (R) and the capacitance (C): \(\tau = R \times C\). This time constant indicates how quickly the capacitor charges and discharges.

### Using Tinkercad:
1. **Create the Circuit**: Use the Tinkercad interface to place the components on the virtual breadboard.
2. **Simulate**: Run the simulation to observe the charging and discharging process. You can use the virtual multimeter to measure the voltage across the capacitor.

This experiment is a great way to visualize the exponential nature of capacitor charging and discharging, and Tinkercad makes it easy to set up and simulate without needing physical components.

You can measure the voltage across the capacitor with a multimeter to see it decrease over time.
It discharges quickly at first, then more slowly.

The time constant (τ) of this circuit is R  C = 1kΩ  100µF = 0.1 seconds.

- Revise this experiment by removing the LED and only showing how the voltage reduces gradually when switch it turned off to cut off power. Measure the multimeter to show the voltage over time.
- Use a power supply that can vary the voltage and current. Makes the above item easier to demonstrate.
- Real experiment will show that LED will be on when you remove the power source from the circuit.
- Hand draw the capacitor circuit and scan it.
- It takes about 5 time constants (0.5 seconds) to fully charge or discharge the capacitor. I don't think this is true. Run the experiment and check.

The experiment shows how the capacitor's voltage decays over time when it’s disconnected from the power source, a characteristic of capacitor discharge in RC circuits.
