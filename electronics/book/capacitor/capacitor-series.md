Capacitors in series reduce the total capacitance (not add up, as they do in parallel) in Tinkercad is to create a basic circuit with two capacitors connected in series and measure the total capacitance. NOT possible to measure capacitance in Tinkercad. 

### Objective

To show that when capacitors are connected in series, the total capacitance is less than the individual capacitances and follows the formula:
\[
\frac{1}{C_\text{total}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}
\]

### Components

1. Breadboard
2. Two capacitors (e.g., 100 ÂµF each)
3. 9V battery
4. Voltage Multimeter
