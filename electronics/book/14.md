Steps

Step 1

Take two 9 volt batteries.

Step 2

Take a multimeter. Set the multimeter to measure voltage.

Step 3

Connect the positive terminal of the first battery to the negative terminal of the second battery. This places the batteries in series.

Step 4

Connect the negative terminal of the first battery to the negative terminal of the multimeter.

Step 5

Connect the positive terminal of the second battery to the positive terminal of the multimeter. This places the multimeter in series in the entire circuit.

Step 6

Run the simulation. You can see the reading shows 18 volts. So two 9 volt batteries add up to 18 volts when they are connected in series.

To show how two 9V batteries add up to create an 18V supply in Tinkercad, you can connect them in series.

By connecting two 9V batteries in series, you achieve a combined voltage of 18V, which you can confirm by measuring across the entire circuit. The circuit diagram is easier to see how everything is connected in series.
