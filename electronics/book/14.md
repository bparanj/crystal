To show how two 9V batteries add up to create an 18V supply in Tinkercad, you can connect them in series. 

### Steps

1. Add Two 9V Batteries:
   - Drag two 9V batteries onto the Tinkercad workspace.

2. Connect the Batteries in Series:
   - Connect the positive terminal of the first battery to the negative terminal of the second battery. This series connection will add the voltages of the two batteries.

3. Measure the Combined Voltage:
   - Connect a multimeter across the open terminals (negative terminal of the first battery and positive terminal of the second battery).
   - Set the multimeter to measure voltage (V).

4. Observe the Result:
   - The multimeter should show 18V, demonstrating that the two 9V batteries in series add up to create an 18V supply.

By connecting two 9V batteries in series, you achieve a combined voltage of 18V, which you can confirm by measuring across the open terminals.
