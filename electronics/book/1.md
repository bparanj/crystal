1. Short Circuit
		Demonstrate what happens to the voltage between the power source when there is a short circuit.

Tinkercad Simulation

Step 1:

Take a breadboard.

Step 2:

Take a 9 volt battery.

Step 3:

Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the + terminal at the top of the breadboard.

Step 4:

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the - terminal at the bottom of the breadboard.

The reason we use this way to connect is that it follows the conventions used in drawing a circuit diagram. We follow the same convention as the circuit diagram in the simulation to make it easy to understand.

Step 5:

Connect the positive terminal to the negative.

In the real world, this would lead to heating of the battery and is not safe.

Step 6:

Take a multimeter.

Step 7:

Connect the negative terminal of the multimeter to the - terminal at the bottom of the breadboard.

Step 8:

Connect the postive terminal of the multimeter to the + terminal at the top of the breadboard.

Step 9:

Click on the Run Simulation in Tinkercad. You will see 0 volts between the positive and negative terminal. This demonstrates the short circuit.

Step 10:

If you remove the connection between the postive and negative terminals of the breadboard, you can see the voltage of the power source is 9 volts.
