   - You can measure the voltage across the capacitor to see it decrease over time.
   - You can measure the voltage across the capacitor with a multimeter to see it increase over time.

You can add a LED to visually show the charging and discharging of capacitor.


   - Notice how the capacitor charges quickly at first, then slows down as it approaches full charge.
   - Similarly, it discharges quickly at first, then more slowly.
   - The time constant (τ) of this circuit is R * C = 1kΩ * 100µF = 0.1 seconds.
   - It takes about 5 time constants (0.5 seconds) to fully charge or discharge the capacitor.

This simple experiment demonstrates the fundamental behavior of capacitors in DC circuits, charging, discharging, and the concept of the time constant.

The 29 shows the closeup screenshot to make the connections easy to see.

A capacitor can store electrical energy and release it gradually when the circuit is disconnected, demonstrating its role in energy storage.

With the slideswitch on, the capacitor charges to the supply voltage (9V). Turning the switch off shows a gradual decrease in voltage, indicating the capacitor is discharging.

Capacitors help stabilize voltage changes, acting as a temporary power source during fluctuations.

A multimeter can measure the capacitor's voltage to monitor how it charges and discharges over time, providing a visual representation of the capacitor’s behavior.

Proper orientation and connection are important — understanding the terminals (e.g., Anode/Cathode for LED, positive/negative for capacitors) ensures correct circuit functionality.

### RC Circuit Experiment

#### Materials:

- 1 Resistor (e.g., 10kΩ)
- 1 Capacitor (e.g., 100μF)
- 1 5V battery
- 1 Switch
- Connecting wires
- Multimeter (to measure voltage across the capacitor)
- Breadboard

#### Setup:

1. Connect the resistor in series with the capacitor.
2. Connect the 5V battery to the circuit.
3. Place the switch in series with the resistor and capacitor.
4. Connect a multimeter across the capacitor to measure its voltage.

### Procedure:

1. Step 1: Charging the capacitor

   - Close the switch to allow current to flow through the circuit.
   - Measure the voltage across the capacitor using the multimeter.
   - Observe how the voltage across the capacitor increases from 0V to 5V as the capacitor charges.

2. Step 2: Discharging the capacitor

   - Open the switch to disconnect the power source.
   - Watch the multimeter again and observe how the voltage across the capacitor decreases over time, eventually reaching 0V.

### Observations:

- The capacitor will charge up to 5V and discharge back to 0V.
- The time constant (τ = R × C) will determine how fast the capacitor charges and discharges.

The simplest electronic circuit to learn about capacitors is a basic RC (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit. This circuit demonstrates capacitor charging and discharging, which is fundamental to understanding capacitor behavior.

This experiment demonstrates the basic function of a **capacitor in a circuit**, particularly its ability to store and gradually release electrical energy.


When the switch is turned on, the capacitor charges up to the voltage of the battery (9 volts), as shown on the multimeter. This demonstrates the capacitor's ability to store electrical energy.

When the switch is turned off, the circuit opens, and the capacitor gradually releases its stored energy through the resistor and LED. This slow discharge is observed as a **gradual decrease in voltage** across the capacitor and a corresponding dimming of the LED.

The experiment shows how the capacitor's voltage decays over time when it’s disconnected from the power source, a characteristic of capacitor discharge in RC circuits.

The resistors control the rate at which the capacitor charges and discharges, ensuring that the current remains within safe limits for the LED and demonstrating how resistors can manage the speed of charging and discharging in a capacitor circuit.

This experiment highlights the capacitor's role in storing and gradually releasing energy in a circuit. It shows how capacitors maintain voltage temporarily when disconnected and how resistors influence the rate of charging and discharging, fundamental concepts in timing and energy storage applications.
