PENDING

Revise this experiment by removing the LED and only showing how the voltage reduces gradually when switch it turned off to cut off power. Measure the multimeter to show the voltage over time.

Real experiment will show that LED will be on when you remove the power source from the circuit.

Step 1

Take a big breadboard.

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery.

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect the slideswitch to the section B of the breadboard. It is sitting on c5-c6-c7 on the breadboard.

Step 5

Connect the third terminal (does this have a name?) to another connection on the breadboard. This is the green color connection wire. The connection starts at d7 and ends at d12.

Review and revise

In a typical SPDT (Single Pole Double Throw) slide switch, you’ll find three terminals:

1. Common (C) - This is the central terminal that connects to either of the other two terminals, depending on the switch position.
2. Normally Open (NO) - This terminal is connected to the common terminal when the switch is in the "on" position.
3. Normally Closed (NC) - This terminal is connected to the common terminal when the switch is in the "off" position.

In a SPST (Single Pole Single Throw) slide switch, there are two terminals:

1. Input - This is where the input current or signal enters.
2. Output - This terminal connects to the input when the switch is in the "on" position, allowing current to flow.

These terminal names can vary based on the switch type, but SPDT and SPST are the most common configurations in slide switches.

Step 6

Connect the red LED to the end of the green connection. e12 is connected to the longer leg of the LED. The shorter leg of the LED is connected to e13.

Is this connected to anode or cathorde?

Step 7

Connect the Cathode of the LED to the another horizontal connection on the breadboard. This is the second green color connection wire. This wire starts at d13 and ends at d18.

Step 8

Connect the end of the second green connection to the section C of the breadboard. This is the third green connection wire. The wire starts at e18 and ends at f18.

Step 9

Connect a resistor to the end of the third green connection wire. One terminal of the resistor connected to g18 and the other terminal is connected to g22.

Step 10

Connect the other end of the resistor to the negative terminal of the breadboard. The wire starts at h22 and ends at the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 11

Connect the capacitor to the section B of the breadboard. The capacitor is on the D row, before the column 1.

Image 11

Step 12

Connect one end of the capacitor to the middle pin of the slideswitch. The second terminal of the capacitor is connected to d6.

Step 13

Connect the other end of the capacitor to the section C of the breadboard. This is the E to F on the very first column.

Step 14

Connect the second resistor to the end of the new connection made in the previous step. One end of the resistor is on row G and first column without number and the other end of the resistor is on row g, column 3.

Step 15

Connect the other end of the second resistor to the negative terminal of the breadboard. The row h and column 3 is connected to the negative terminal.

Image 15 (retake this screenshot - the wire must be black)

Step 16

Connect the postive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 17

Connect the positive terminal of the breadboard to the first terminal of the slideswitch. This completes the circuit.

Step 18

Take a multimeter.

Image 18

Step 19

Connect the negative terminal of the multimeter to the first terminal of the capacitor.

Step 20

Connect the positive terminal of the multimeter to the second terminal of the capacitor.

Step 21

Run the simulation. The voltage reading will be 9 volts. This is the same as the battery voltage. In this setup, the slideswitch is on.

Image 21

Step 22

Turn off the slideswitch. You will now observe the gradual decrease in voltage across the capacitor.

The 29 shows the closeup screenshot to make the connections easy to see.

A capacitor can store electrical energy and release it gradually when the circuit is disconnected, demonstrating its role in energy storage.

With the slideswitch on, the capacitor charges to the supply voltage (9V). Turning the switch off shows a gradual decrease in voltage, indicating the capacitor is discharging.

Capacitors help stabilize voltage changes, acting as a temporary power source during fluctuations.

A multimeter can measure the capacitor's voltage to monitor how it charges and discharges over time, providing a visual representation of the capacitor’s behavior.

Proper orientation and connection are important — understanding the terminals (e.g., Anode/Cathode for LED, positive/negative for capacitors) ensures correct circuit functionality.
