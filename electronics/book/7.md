Capacitor

Demonstrate the basic function of a capacitor in a circuit.

Components

1. 9 volt battery
2. Slideswitch
3. Red LED
4. Resistor with 1 k ohm value (quantity: 2)
5. Capacitor with 100 n Faraday value
6. Voltage Multimeter

Step 1

Take a big breadboard.

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery.

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 4

Connect the slideswitch to the section B of the breadboard.

Step 5

Connect the third terminal (does this have a name?) to another connection on the breadboard. This is the green color connection wire.

Review and revise
In a typical SPDT (Single Pole Double Throw) slide switch, you’ll find three terminals:

1. Common (C) - This is the central terminal that connects to either of the other two terminals, depending on the switch position.
2. Normally Open (NO) - This terminal is connected to the common terminal when the switch is in the "on" position.
3. Normally Closed (NC) - This terminal is connected to the common terminal when the switch is in the "off" position.

In a SPST (Single Pole Single Throw) slide switch, there are two terminals:

1. Input - This is where the input current or signal enters.
2. Output - This terminal connects to the input when the switch is in the "on" position, allowing current to flow.

These terminal names can vary based on the switch type, but SPDT and SPST are the most common configurations in slide switches.

Step 6

Connect the red LED to the end of the green connection. Is this connected to anode or cathorde?

Step 7

Connect the Cathode of the LED to the another horizontal connection on the breadboard. This is the second green color connection wire.

Step 8

Connect the end of the second green connection to the section C of the breadboard. This is the third green connection wire.

Step 9

Connect a resistor to the end of the third green connection wire.

Step 10

Connect the other end of the resistor to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 11

Connect the capacitor to the section B of the breadboard.

Step 12

Connect one end of the capacitor to the middle pin of the slideswitch.

Step 13

Connect the other end of the capacitor to the section C of the breadboard.

Step 14

Connect the second resistor to the end of the new connection made in the previous step.

Step 15

Connect the other end of the second resistor to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 16

Connect the postive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Step 17

Connect the positive terminal of the breadboard to the first terminal of the slideswitch. This completes the circuit.

Step 18

Take a multimeter.

Step 19

Connect the negative terminal of the multimeter to the first terminal of the capacitor.

Step 20

Connect the positive terminal of the multimeter to the second terminal of the capacitor.

Step 21

Run the simulation. The voltage reading will be 9 volts. This is the same as the battery voltage. In this setup, the slideswitch is on.

Step 22

Turn off the slideswitch. You will now observe the gradual decrease in voltage across the capacitor.

### Key Takeaways

1. A capacitor can store electrical energy and release it gradually when the circuit is disconnected, demonstrating its role in energy storage.

2. With the slideswitch on, the capacitor charges to the supply voltage (9V). Turning the switch off shows a gradual decrease in voltage, indicating the capacitor is discharging.

3. Capacitors help stabilize voltage changes, acting as a temporary power source during fluctuations.

4. A multimeter can measure the capacitor's voltage to monitor how it charges and discharges over time, providing a visual representation of the capacitor’s behavior.

5. Proper orientation and connection are important — understanding the terminals (e.g., Anode/Cathode for LED, positive/negative for capacitors) ensures correct circuit functionality.
