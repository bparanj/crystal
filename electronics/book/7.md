You can measure the voltage across the capacitor with a multimeter to see it decrease over time.
It discharges quickly at first, then more slowly.
The time constant (τ) of this circuit is R  C = 1kΩ  100µF = 0.1 seconds.

This experiment demonstrates the fundamental behavior of capacitors in DC circuits, charging, discharging, and the concept of the time constant.

PENDING

- Revise this experiment by removing the LED and only showing how the voltage reduces gradually when switch it turned off to cut off power. Measure the multimeter to show the voltage over time.
- Use a power supply that can vary the voltage and current. Makes the above item easier to demonstrate.
- Real experiment will show that LED will be on when you remove the power source from the circuit.
- Hand draw the capacitor circuit and scan it.
- It takes about 5 time constants (0.5 seconds) to fully charge or discharge the capacitor. I don't think this is true. Run the experiment and check.

### 1. Experiment 1: Charging and Discharging a Capacitor

Objective:

Demonstrate the charging and discharging process of a capacitor and how it stores electrical energy.

Materials:

- Capacitor (e.g., 100 µF)
- Battery (e.g., 9V)
- Resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ)
- Switch
- LED or small light bulb
- Wires for connections

Procedure:

1. Set Up the Circuit:

Connect the battery, capacitor, resistor, and switch in series with the LED. The circuit should be: Battery -> Switch -> Resistor -> Capacitor -> LED -> Battery.

2. Close the Switch (Charging):

Close the switch to start charging the capacitor. The LED will light up as current flows through the circuit and charges the capacitor.

3. Observe the LED:

Over time, you will notice the LED gradually dimming as the capacitor charges and the current decreases.

4. Open the Switch (Discharging):

After the capacitor is fully charged, open the switch to disconnect the battery. Then, connect the LED directly across the capacitor (without the battery) to observe the discharge process.

5. Observe the LED:

The LED will light up again, gradually dimming as the capacitor discharges its stored energy through the LED.

6. Explain:

This experiment demonstrates how a capacitor stores energy in an electric field when charging and then releases that energy when discharging.

A capacitor can store electrical energy and release it gradually when the circuit is disconnected, demonstrating its role in energy storage.

With the slideswitch on, the capacitor charges to the supply voltage (9V). Turning the switch off shows a gradual decrease in voltage, indicating the capacitor is discharging.

Capacitors help stabilize voltage changes, acting as a temporary power source during fluctuations.

A multimeter can measure the capacitor's voltage to monitor how it charges and discharges over time, providing a visual representation of the capacitor’s behavior.

Proper orientation and connection are important — understanding the terminals (e.g., Anode/Cathode for LED, positive/negative for capacitors) ensures correct circuit functionality.

### RC Circuit Experiment

#### Setup:

1. Step 1: Charging the capacitor

   - Close the switch to allow current to flow through the circuit.
   - Measure the voltage across the capacitor using the multimeter.
   - Observe how the voltage across the capacitor increases from 0V to 5V as the capacitor charges.

2. Step 2: Discharging the capacitor

   - Open the switch to disconnect the power source.
   - Watch the multimeter again and observe how the voltage across the capacitor decreases over time, eventually reaching 0V.

- The capacitor will charge up to 5V and discharge back to 0V.
- The time constant (τ = R × C) will determine how fast the capacitor charges and discharges.

The simplest electronic circuit to learn about capacitors is a basic RC (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit. This circuit demonstrates capacitor charging and discharging, which is fundamental to understanding capacitor behavior.

This experiment demonstrates the basic function of a capacitor in a circuit, its ability to store and gradually release electrical energy.

When the switch is turned on, the capacitor charges up to the voltage of the battery (9 volts), as shown on the multimeter. This demonstrates the capacitor's ability to store electrical energy.

When the switch is turned off, the circuit opens, and the capacitor gradually releases its stored energy through the resistor and LED. This slow discharge is observed as a gradual decrease in voltage across the capacitor and a corresponding dimming of the LED.

The experiment shows how the capacitor's voltage decays over time when it’s disconnected from the power source, a characteristic of capacitor discharge in RC circuits.

The resistors control the rate at which the capacitor charges and discharges, ensuring that the current remains within safe limits for the LED and demonstrating how resistors can manage the speed of charging and discharging in a capacitor circuit.

This experiment highlights the capacitor's role in storing and gradually releasing energy in a circuit. It shows how capacitors maintain voltage temporarily when disconnected and how resistors influence the rate of charging and discharging, fundamental concepts in timing and energy storage applications.
