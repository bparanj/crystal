Design a simple experiment for each of the bullet item

## Component Notes

A resistor is used for: 

- limiting the charging rate of a capacitor
- providing appropriate control voltage to semiconductors such as bipolar transistors
- protecting LEDs or other semiconductors from excessive current
- adjusting or limiting the frequency response in an audio circuit (in conjunction with other components) 
- pulling up or pulling down the voltage at the input pin of a digital logic chip
- controlling a voltage at a point in a circuit

In this last application, two resistors can be placed in series to create a voltage divider.

In the process of impeding the flow of current and reducing voltage, a resistor absorbs electrical energy, which it must dissipate as heat. The heat dissipation is typically a fraction of a watt.

Power, measured in watts (W), is indeed the product of voltage (V) and current (I):

P = V x I

This relationship defines how much electrical energy is being converted into another form per unit of time.

Not all of this energy conversion results in heat. The actual dissipation depends on the specific components and their efficiency. For resistors, they dissipate electrical energy primarily as heat due to their resistance. Therefore, while a fraction of the total energy becomes heat, the calculation

P = V x I

still holds for measuring total electrical power.
