A push button makes contact only when pressed and disconnects when released. This is used when momentary activation is needes such as resetting a device, doorbell or keyboards.

A slide switch stays in either on or off position. This is used when you want to turn a device on or off, like a lamp switch.



We use both **push buttons** and **slide switches** in electronic circuits because they serve **different functions and interaction styles**:

1. **Push Button**:
   - A push button is a **momentary switch**: it only makes contact when pressed and disconnects when released.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications where temporary activation is needed, such as resetting a device, turning on a temporary function (like a doorbell), or controlling input on devices (e.g., keyboards).

2. **Slide Switch**:
   - A slide switch is a **maintained switch**: it stays in the position it's moved to, either "on" or "off."
   - **Use Case**: Useful for functions that need a lasting state, such as turning a device on/off or toggling between modes (like a lamp switch).

### Why Two Types?
The difference lies in **how long** the circuit needs to stay connected:
- **Push buttons** are ideal for short, temporary actions.
- **Slide switches** are suitable for long-term, persistent settings.

Each switch type is tailored to specific interaction needs, making them complementary in electronic circuit designs.
