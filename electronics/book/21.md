The simplest experiment to demonstrate a Zener diode's function is to connect it in reverse bias with a variable voltage source and a resistor in series, then gradually increase the voltage until the voltage across the diode stabilizes at the Zener voltage, indicating the "breakdown" point where the diode acts as a voltage regulator; you can observe this stable voltage even when the input voltage continues to increase.
