The simplest experiment to demonstrate a Zener diode's function is to connect it in reverse bias with a variable voltage source and a resistor in series, then gradually increase the voltage until the voltage across the diode stabilizes at the Zener voltage, indicating the "breakdown" point where the diode acts as a voltage regulator; you can observe this stable voltage even when the input voltage continues to increase.

Zener Diode

Demonstrate the basic use of Zener diode.

Here's a simple experiment to demonstrate the basic functionality of a Zener diode in Tinkercad, specifically its ability to regulate voltage in reverse bias.

### Objective

To show how a Zener diode maintains a stable voltage across it when reverse-biased beyond its breakdown voltage.

### Components

- DC Power Supply (adjustable to at least 12V)
- Zener Diode (e.g., 5.1V Zener)
- Resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ)
- Multimeter (to measure voltage across the Zener diode)

### Setup

1. Circuit Assembly:
   - Connect the positive terminal of the DC power supply to one end of the resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to the anode (positive side) of the Zener diode.
   - Connect the cathode (negative side) of the Zener diode to the negative terminal of the power supply.

   This places the Zener diode in reverse bias (cathode to positive terminal of the power supply through the resistor).

2. Measurement Setup:
   - Connect the multimeter across the Zener diode (cathode and anode) to measure the voltage.

3. Set Initial Voltage:
   - Start with a low voltage on the DC power supply (e.g., 1V) and observe the voltage across the Zener diode on the multimeter.
   - You should see that the voltage across the Zener diode is close to the input voltage at this point, as it is not yet in breakdown.

4. Increase the Input Voltage:
   - Gradually increase the DC power supply voltage (e.g., to 5V, 8V, etc.).
   - Once you reach the breakdown voltage of the Zener diode (around 5.1V in this example), you’ll observe that the voltage across the Zener diode remains constant at approximately its rated breakdown voltage (5.1V), even as you increase the power supply voltage further.

### Results

- Below Breakdown Voltage: The voltage across the Zener diode increases with the input voltage but remains below its breakdown voltage.
- At and Above Breakdown Voltage: Once the input voltage surpasses the breakdown voltage, the Zener diode maintains a steady voltage across itself (approximately 5.1V in this case), demonstrating its voltage regulation property.

The Zener diode, when reverse-biased, allows current to flow once the input voltage exceeds its breakdown voltage. It then stabilizes the voltage across it, effectively “clamping” the voltage to its breakdown value, making it ideal for voltage regulation applications. This simple experiment demonstrates the core functionality of Zener diodes in voltage stabilization and protection circuits.
