The simplest experiment to demonstrate a Zener diode's basic functionality (voltage regulation) would be to create a simple voltage regulator circuit. Here's a straightforward experiment:

Components:

1. Zener diode (e.g., 5.1V)
2. Resistor (1kΩ)
3. Variable DC power supply (0-12V)
4. Multimeter
5. Breadboard

Steps:

   - Connect the resistor to the positive supply
   - Connect Zener diode cathode (marked band) to the resistor
   - Connect Zener diode anode to ground
   - Connect voltmeter in parallel with the Zener diode


   - Start with supply voltage at 0V
   - Slowly increase voltage while monitoring the Zener voltage
   - You'll observe that once the supply voltage exceeds the Zener voltage:
     * The voltage across the Zener remains nearly constant
     * This demonstrates the voltage regulation property

Results:

- Below Zener voltage: The diode voltage follows supply voltage
- Above Zener voltage: The diode maintains constant voltage (e.g., 5.1V)

This experiment shows the Zener diode's main function as a voltage regulator.


The simplest experiment to demonstrate a Zener diode's function is to connect it in reverse bias with a variable voltage source and a resistor in series, then gradually increase the voltage until the voltage across the diode stabilizes at the Zener voltage, indicating the "breakdown" point where the diode acts as a voltage regulator. You can observe this stable voltage even when the input voltage continues to increase.

Zener Diode

Demonstrate the basic use of Zener diode.

A simple experiment to demonstrate the basic functionality of a Zener diode. We will see its ability to regulate voltage in reverse bias.

The Zener diode, when reverse-biased, allows current to flow once the input voltage exceeds its breakdown voltage. It then stabilizes the voltage across it, effectively “clamping” the voltage to its breakdown value, making it ideal for voltage regulation applications. This simple experiment demonstrates the core functionality of Zener diodes in voltage stabilization and protection circuits.
