A simple experiment to illustrate the static electric effect:

### Objective:

To demonstrate how rubbing different materials together can generate static electricity and cause objects to attract or repel each other.

### Materials:

- A balloon
- A piece of wool cloth or a sweater
- Small pieces of paper or tissue (cut into tiny bits)
- A metal doorknob or any metal object

### Procedure:

1. Charge the Balloon:

 Inflate the balloon and tie it off. Then, vigorously rub the balloon against the wool cloth or sweater for about 10-15 seconds. This rubbing transfers electrons from the cloth to the balloon, giving the balloon a negative charge.

2. Test Attraction:

 After rubbing the balloon, slowly bring it close to the small pieces of paper or tissue without touching them. The paper bits should start to move toward the balloon and stick to it.

3. Observe Repulsion:

 Rub the balloon again to recharge it. Next, bring the balloon near a metal object like a doorknob, but do not touch it. You might see the balloon slightly repel from the metal due to the induced charge on the metal surface.

4. Demonstrate Discharge:

 After rubbing the balloon and bringing it close to the metal object, slowly move the balloon until it touches the metal. You might feel or hear a small spark, which is the discharge of static electricity as the electrons move from the balloon to the metal object.

This experiment demonstrates the static electric effect, where rubbing the balloon against the wool cloth causes it to accumulate an excess of electrons, making it negatively charged. The charged balloon can attract neutral objects like small paper bits by inducing opposite charges on their surfaces. The balloon may also repel from a metal object due to charge induction on the metal. When the balloon finally touches the metal, the stored static charge is discharged, often producing a small spark or a slight shock. This illustrates how static electricity is generated and how it can cause objects to attract, repel, and discharge.

# Experiment: The Dancing Tissue Paper

A simple experiment to illustrate the static electric effect.

Materials needed:

- A plastic comb or balloon
- Small pieces of tissue paper
- Your hair or a wool sweater

Procedure:

1. Cut several small pieces of tissue paper (about 1 cm square).
2. Spread these pieces on a flat, dry surface like a table.
3. Take the plastic comb or balloon and rub it vigorously against your hair or a wool sweater for about 30 seconds.
4. Slowly bring the comb or balloon close to the tissue paper pieces, but don't touch them.

Observations:

You should see the tissue paper pieces "jump" up towards the comb or balloon, appearing to dance. Some pieces might even stick to the comb or balloon.

This experiment demonstrates the static electric effect. When you rub the plastic comb or balloon against your hair or wool, you're creating a charge imbalance through triboelectric charging. Electrons move from your hair or the wool to the plastic, giving the plastic a negative charge.

When you bring this charged object near the neutral tissue paper, it induces a temporary charge separation in the paper. The side of the paper closer to the charged object becomes oppositely charged (positive in this case), while the far side becomes similarly charged (negative). Since opposite charges attract, the tissue paper is pulled towards the comb or balloon.

This experiment illustrates concepts of the static electric effect: charge transfer, induction, and electrostatic attraction.
