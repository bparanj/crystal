### Transistor as an Amplifier

Demonstrate the amplification property of a transistor by amplifying a small audio signal.

Materials:

- NPN transistor (e.g., 2N3904)
- Resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ for the collector, 10 kΩ for the base)
- Capacitor (e.g., 10 µF)
- Small speaker or headphone
- Battery (e.g., 9V)
- Audio source (e.g., a phone with an audio jack)
- Wires for connections

Procedure:

   - Connect the collector of the transistor to the positive terminal of the battery through the 1 kΩ resistor.
   - Connect the emitter directly to the negative terminal of the battery.
   - Connect the base of the transistor to the audio signal source (e.g., the headphone output of a phone) through the 10 kΩ resistor and the capacitor (the capacitor blocks any DC component).
   - Connect the speaker between the collector of the transistor and the positive terminal of the battery.

   - Play a low-volume audio signal from the phone. The audio signal will modulate the base current of the transistor.
   - The transistor amplifies the audio signal, driving the speaker with a larger current than the original audio source could provide.

   This experiment shows how a transistor can amplify a small input signal (audio from the phone) into a larger output signal (enough to drive the speaker), demonstrating its use as an amplifier.

In Tinkercad, this exact setup can't be fully implemented due to certain limitations in component availability and the lack of audio input/output simulation. However, you can still approximate the circuit to understand the amplification concept and transistor behavior.

### Steps to Approximate This Circuit in Tinkercad

   - NPN Transistor: Use a 2N3904 transistor.
   - Resistors: Place a 1 kΩ resistor on the collector and a 10 kΩ resistor on the base.
   - Capacitor: Insert a 10 µF capacitor between the audio input (simulated voltage source) and the base to block any DC component.
   - Battery: Use a 9V battery for the power supply.
   - Speaker Substitute: Since Tinkercad doesn’t have speakers or audio output, you can use an LED or another component as a visual indicator of current flow changes.

   - Connect the collector of the transistor to the positive terminal of the battery through the 1 kΩ resistor.
   - Connect the emitter directly to the negative terminal of the battery.
   - Connect the base of the transistor to an audio source substitute, such as a small AC signal source, through the 10 kΩ resistor and 10 µF capacitor.
   - Instead of a speaker, place an LED between the collector and the positive terminal to visually observe the change in current (indicating amplification).

   - Set up the AC source with a small, low-frequency signal (approximating an audio signal).
   - Observe the LED brightness or use a multimeter to measure the voltage across the collector-emitter path to see how the transistor amplifies the signal.

### Limitations

- No Real Audio Signal: Tinkercad doesn’t support audio inputs or outputs directly, so you can’t hear the amplified signal. The setup with an LED or multimeter only visualizes amplification.
- No Real-Time Sound Output: For true audio amplification, you’d need a breadboard setup or another simulation platform that supports audio signals, such as LTSpice or Proteus.

This setup provides a visual approximation but won’t allow for actual audio playback.
