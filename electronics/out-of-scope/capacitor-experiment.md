Objective:

Demonstrate how a capacitor can be used to filter signals by blocking DC components and allowing AC components to pass.

Materials:

- Capacitor (e.g., 10 µF)
- Signal generator (or a function generator app on a smartphone)
- Resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ)
- Speaker or small piezo buzzer
- Wires for connections

Procedure:

1. : Connect the signal generator to a series circuit consisting of the resistor and capacitor. Connect the output of this circuit to the speaker or buzzer.
2. Set the Signal Generator: Set the signal generator to produce a low-frequency AC signal (e.g., 1 Hz). The speaker should produce a sound corresponding to the frequency.
3. Increase the Frequency: Gradually increase the frequency of the signal generator to higher frequencies (e.g., 100 Hz, 1 kHz, etc.). Observe the sound produced by the speaker.

As you increase the frequency, the capacitor allows higher frequency signals to pass through more easily while blocking lower frequencies. This experiment demonstrates how capacitors can be used in AC circuits as filters to allow certain frequencies to pass while blocking others, illustrating the concept of capacitance in signal processing.
