This is already covered in 8.md. It uses multimeter to show the discharge of capacitor. The Capacitor Charge Discharge Final uses two LEDs to show charge and discharge.

### 1. Understand the Basic Behavior of a Polarized Capacitor with DC

Refer Charge Discharge working experiment and capture images. See Capacitor Charge Discharge Final in personal account. 

Objective:

To observe how a polarized capacitor charges and discharges with a DC power source.

Setup:

Connect a DC power supply (e.g., 5V) to a polarized capacitor in series with a resistor.

Procedure:

Gradually increase the voltage and observe how the capacitor charges (initially allowing current to flow).
Disconnect the power and observe the discharge through the resistor.

1 micro F - Faster discharge
10 micro F - Slower discharge

Notice how the capacitor charges with the correct polarity and discharges when disconnected from the source. This experiment shows the capacitorâ€™s ability to store and release energy.

Variation: LED to visualize the discharge. Skip this, it's not bright enough.
