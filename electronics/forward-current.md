## Forward Current

Forward current is the flow of current through a diode in the direction it is intended to conduct. For a typical diode, this means the current flows from the anode (positive side) to the cathode (negative side). When a diode is forward-biased, meaning the voltage on the anode is higher than the voltage on the cathode, it allows current to pass through—this current is called forward current.

It's essentially the "working" current that the diode is designed to handle when it’s conducting normally.
