What is the Second Law of Thermodynamics?

The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that in any natural process, the total entropy (disorder) of an isolated system always increases over time. This means energy transformations are never 100% efficient, as some energy is always dispersed as heat, leading to increased disorder.

What is the concept of entropy in electrical system?

In an electrical system, entropy represents the measure of energy dispersion or inefficiency. As electrical energy flows through components (like resistors), some of it converts to heat, increasing the system's disorder. This loss as heat limits efficiency and contributes to the overall entropy, aligning with the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
