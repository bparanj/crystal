Conventional current flow is the flow of positive charge from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of a power source. This idea was established before the discovery of the electron and has remained a standard in circuit analysis and electrical engineering.

In reality, the actual flow of charge in most conductive materials is due to electrons, which are negatively charged particles moving from the negative terminal to the positive terminal. This is known as electron flow. Despite this, conventional current flow is still widely used because it simplifies the analysis and design of electrical circuits.
