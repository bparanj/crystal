The term inductor comes from the word induce, which originates from the Latin word inducere, meaning to lead into or bring in.

In the context of electrical engineering, an inductor induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a circuit when the current flowing through it changes. This phenomenon is described by Faraday's Law of Induction, where a changing magnetic field within a coil of wire generates an induced voltage. The term inductor reflects this ability to induce voltage and oppose changes in current flow through electromagnetic effects.

inductor

An inductor is a passive electronic component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electrical current flows through it. Inductors oppose changes in current and are used in filtering, energy storage, and tuning circuits. The amount of inductance depends on factors such as the coil’s number of turns, the core material, and the shape and size of the coil.

### Atomic Ideas:

1. What is an inductor, and how does it store energy?

   An inductor stores energy in a magnetic field when current passes through it. The inductor’s ability to store energy depends on its inductance, measured in henries (H).

   Think of an inductor like a flywheel. When you push on it (apply current), it stores energy by spinning faster (creating a magnetic field). When you stop pushing, the flywheel keeps spinning for a while (the inductor resists changes in current).

   In a DC power supply, an inductor might be used to store energy in the magnetic field while current flows, helping to smooth out voltage fluctuations.

2. What is inductance?

   Inductance is the property of an inductor that quantifies its ability to oppose changes in current and store energy in a magnetic field. It is measured in henries (H).

    Inductance is like the mass of a flywheel. A heavier flywheel (higher inductance) takes more force to change its speed (current) and stores more energy.

   A 10mH (millihenry) inductor will oppose sudden changes in current more than a 1mH inductor, making it better for filtering out rapid fluctuations in a circuit.

3. How does an inductor oppose changes in current?

   An inductor generates a voltage that opposes any sudden changes in current. This phenomenon is known as Lenz’s Law and is expressed as $$ V = -L \frac{dI}{dt} $$, where $V$ is the voltage, $L$ is the inductance, and $\frac{dI}{dt}$ is the rate of change of current.

    Picture a moving train. When you try to speed it up (change the current quickly), inertia (inductance) resists the change. Similarly, if you try to stop the train suddenly, it resists that too.

    In a circuit with an inductor, if the current tries to increase or decrease suddenly, the inductor generates a voltage that resists this change, helping to smooth out the current.

4. What happens when current through an inductor changes suddenly?

   When the current through an inductor changes suddenly, the inductor generates a voltage (back EMF) that opposes the change. This effect can cause spikes in voltage if the current changes too quickly.

   Changing the current in an inductor is like trying to change the direction of a spinning top — if you push it too fast, it resists and may even wobble (create a voltage spike).

   In switching power supplies, inductors help regulate current, but if a switch is turned off too suddenly, the inductor can generate a high-voltage spike that needs to be managed by other circuit components.

5. What are the common applications of inductors?

   Inductors are used in filters (to block or pass certain frequencies), transformers (to transfer energy between circuits), and energy storage devices in power supplies.

   Inductors are like traffic regulators. They control the flow of current (traffic) by slowing down rapid changes and keeping the system smooth.

   In a low-pass filter, an inductor allows low-frequency signals to pass through while blocking high-frequency noise, helping to clean up the signal in audio circuits.

4. Resonant Circuits:

Inductors and capacitors are used together in resonant circuits (LC circuits) to select or reject certain frequencies. Learning about resonance helps in designing radios, filters, and oscillators.

Inductors can transfer energy between two circuits through mutual inductance. This concept is fundamental to transformers, which convert voltages and currents in power systems.

An inductor functions as a passive electronic component that stores energy in a magnetic field when an electric current flows through it. It  consists of a coil of wire, often wrapped around a core material. Inductors resist changes in electric current passing through them, a property known as inductance. This characteristic makes inductors valuable in various applications such as filtering, energy storage, and signal processing in electronic circuits.

4.  What is self-resonance in inductors, and why does it matter?

Self-resonance in inductors occurs due to parasitic capacitance between the coil windings, creating a parallel LC circuit. This phenomenon limits the useful frequency range of the inductor, as it behaves capacitively above its self-resonant frequency.

Self-resonance in an inductor is like an athlete's "sweet spot" in performance. Just as an athlete performs optimally within a certain range but struggles beyond it, an inductor works effectively up to its self-resonant frequency but behaves differently beyond that point.

 To observe self-resonance, follow these steps:

1) Obtain a high-frequency inductor (e.g., 10 µH).
2) Connect it to a vector network analyzer (VNA) or a frequency sweep generator and oscilloscope.
3) Sweep the frequency from low (e.g., 1 MHz) to high (e.g., 100 MHz).
4) Plot the inductor's impedance vs. frequency.
5) You'll notice that the impedance increases with frequency initially (inductive behavior), reaches a peak (self-resonance), then starts to decrease (capacitive behavior).
6) The frequency at the impedance peak is the self-resonant frequency (SRF). For a 10 µH inductor, this might be around 20-30 MHz.
