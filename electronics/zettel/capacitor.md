Capacity - What is the dictionary definition?

The term "capacitor" comes from the Latin word *capacitas*, meaning "capacity" or "ability to hold." A capacitor is a device that has the ability to "hold" or store electric charge.

The name reflects its primary function: storing electrical energy in the form of an electric field between two conductive plates separated by an insulating material (dielectric). When connected to a power source, the capacitor accumulates and stores charge, which it can release when needed.

SNIP

Initially, capacitors were called **condensers**, derived from the Latin *condensare*, meaning "to condense," as they were thought to "condense" the electric charge. The term "capacitor" became more common over time as its ability to store charge was emphasized.

SNIP

Capacitors are electronic components that store electrical energy as electrical energy in the form of an electric field. They can release this stored energy when needed in a circuit.

You have to explain electric field before explaining capacitor.

A capacitor is a passive electronic component. It stores electrical energy in an electric field. They block direct current (DC) from flowing through them. They allow alternating current (AC) to pass through them. They are used to store energy, filtering and timing applications.

What does depending on frequency mean here? What range of frequency do they allow to pass through.



High-frequency signals pass through a capacitor more easily than low-frequency ones due to the **capacitive reactance** property of the capacitor. Capacitive reactance is the opposition that a capacitor provides to an AC signal, and it depends on the frequency of the signal:

\[
X_C = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}
\]

Where:
- \( X_C \) is the capacitive reactance (in ohms, Ω).
- \( f \) is the frequency of the signal (in hertz, Hz).
- \( C \) is the capacitance (in farads, F).

### Key Points
1. **Inverse Relationship**: Capacitive reactance (\(X_C\)) is inversely proportional to frequency (\(f\)). As the frequency increases, \( X_C \) decreases, allowing more current to pass.
  
2. **Low Reactance at High Frequency**: For high-frequency signals, \( X_C \) becomes very low, effectively making the capacitor behave more like a short circuit, allowing the signal to pass through easily.

3. **High Reactance at Low Frequency**: For low-frequency signals, \( X_C \) is high, acting more like an open circuit, which blocks or attenuates the low-frequency components.

This frequency-dependent behavior makes capacitors useful for **filtering applications**, where they block DC or low-frequency signals while allowing high-frequency AC signals to pass through.

## Overview: Capacitor
A **capacitor** is a passive electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material, called a **dielectric**. When a voltage is applied across the plates, an electric charge builds up, creating a potential difference between them. Capacitors do not allow direct current (DC) to flow through them but can allow alternating current (AC) to pass, depending on the frequency. They are  used in circuits for energy storage, filtering, and timing applications.

## Atomic Ideas

1. **What is the basic structure of a capacitor?**
   - **Question**: What makes up the basic structure of a capacitor?
   - **Atomic Idea**: A capacitor consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material called a dielectric. The plates accumulate charge when connected to a voltage source, while the dielectric prevents direct current from flowing between the plates.
   - **Analogy**: Think of a capacitor like a water tank with a rubber divider in the middle. The two sides of the tank (plates) can store water (charge), but the rubber divider (dielectric) prevents the water from flowing directly between them.
   - **Example**: In a basic capacitor, like a ceramic capacitor, the plates are made of metal, and the dielectric is made of ceramic. When you connect this capacitor to a 9V battery, one plate becomes positively charged, while the other becomes negatively charged.

2. **How does a capacitor store energy?**
   - **Question**: How does a capacitor store electrical energy?
   - **Atomic Idea**: A capacitor stores energy by creating an electric field between its two plates. The energy stored depends on the charge on the plates and the voltage across the capacitor. The relationship is given by the formula:

   $$ E = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 $$

   where $E$ is energy (in joules), $C$ is capacitance (in farads), and $V$ is voltage (in volts).
   - **Analogy**: A capacitor is like a compressed spring. Just as a spring stores mechanical energy when compressed, a capacitor stores electrical energy when its plates hold opposite charges.
   - **Example**: If you have a 10µF capacitor charged to 5V, the energy stored is:

   $$ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 5^2 = 0.125 \, \text{joules} $$


Capacitance is the ability of a capacitor to store charge per unit voltage. Capacitance is measured in farads (F symbol). Higher capacitance means more charge can be stored for a given voltage. Capacitance is like the size of a water tank. A larger tank can hold more water for the same pressure. The water corresponds to charge and pressure corresponds to voltage in a circuit. A capacitor with 100 micro F capacitance can store more charge at the same voltage than a capacitor with 10 micro F.

When connected to a DC source, the capacitor charges until its voltage reaches the source and then stops the current. In an AC circuit, the capacitor continuously charges and discharges as the current changes direction.

In a DC circuit, a capacitor is like a dam that holds water. In an AC circuit, the capacitor is like a swinging gate that opens and closes, allowing some water to pass through.

In an AC circuit with 1 kHz signal, a 10 micro F capacitor will allow the current to pass, but with a lower-frequency signal such as 10 Hz, the capacitor will block most of the current.

They stabilize power supply voltages, remove noise from signals and create delays in electronic circuits. In a circuit, a capacitor acts like a sponge that absorbs and release charge. This smoothes out fluctuations in the voltage. This provides a short power backup. In a power supply circuit, they are used to smooth out the ripple voltage from a rectifier. This provides a steady DC output.

## Solution: Calculating Energy Stored in a Capacitor

### Problem Statement:
Given a capacitor with a capacitance of 5µF and a voltage of 12V, calculate the energy stored in the capacitor.

### Solution:

We use the energy formula for a capacitor:

$$ E = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 $$

Where:
- $E$ is the energy in joules,
- $C$ is the capacitance in farads,
- $V$ is the voltage in volts.

Substituting the values:

$$ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \times 12^2 \, \text{V} $$

$$ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 10^{-6} \times 144 $$

$$ E = 0.36 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{joules} = 0.36 \, \text{mJ} $$

Thus, the energy stored in the capacitor is **0.36 millijoules**.

Overview:
A capacitor serves as a fundamental passive electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material called a dielectric. Capacitors find extensive use in electronic circuits for tasks such as filtering, coupling, decoupling, and energy storage. Their ability to store and release electrical charge makes them essential in various applications, from simple timing circuits to complex power supplies.

Atomic Ideas:

1. What defines a capacitor's basic structure and function?
A capacitor consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material (dielectric). It stores electrical energy in the form of an electric field between the plates when a voltage is applied, and can release this energy when needed.
Analogy: A capacitor resembles a water tank with a flexible membrane in the middle. As water (electric charge) flows in, it stretches the membrane (builds an electric field), storing potential energy that can be released later.
Example: To observe a capacitor's charge and discharge:
a) Obtain a large capacitor (e.g., 1000μF), an LED, and a 9V battery.
b) Connect the capacitor's positive lead to the battery's positive terminal for a few seconds.
c) Disconnect the capacitor from the battery.
d) Connect the LED to the capacitor (positive to positive, negative to negative).
e) Observe the LED light up and gradually dim as the capacitor discharges.

2. How does one express capacitance mathematically?
Capacitance (C) equals the amount of electric charge (Q) stored on each plate divided by the voltage (V) across the plates: $C = \frac{Q}{V}$
Analogy: This relationship resembles the elasticity of a spring. The more elastic (higher capacitance), the more it can stretch (store charge) for a given force (voltage).
Example: Calculate the capacitance when a 5V potential difference results in 0.00002 coulombs of charge storage:
a) Use the formula $C = \frac{Q}{V}$
b) Substitute the values: $C = \frac{0.00002 \text{ C}}{5 \text{ V}}$
c) Perform the division: $C = 0.000004 \text{ F}$ or 4 μF
d) The capacitance equals 4 microfarads.

3. What factors affect a capacitor's capacitance?
The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor depends on the area (A) of the plates, the distance (d) between them, and the dielectric constant (ε) of the insulating material: $C = \frac{\varepsilon A}{d}$
Analogy: This relationship resembles filling a box with packing peanuts. Larger box area (A) allows more peanuts (charge), while greater box height (d) requires more peanuts to fill. The peanut's compressibility (ε) affects how many fit in a given volume.
Example: Calculate the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor with plate area 0.01 m², separation 0.001 m, and a dielectric constant of 2.1 (ε₀ = 8.85 × 10⁻¹² F/m):
a) Use the formula $C = \frac{\varepsilon A}{d}$
b) Calculate ε: ε = 2.1 × 8.85 × 10⁻¹² F/m = 1.86 × 10⁻¹¹ F/m
c) Substitute the values: $C = \frac{1.86 × 10^{-11} \text{ F/m} × 0.01 \text{ m}^2}{0.001 \text{ m}}$
d) Perform the calculation: $C = 1.86 × 10^{-10} \text{ F}$ or 186 pF
e) The capacitance equals 186 picofarads.

4. How do capacitors behave in DC and AC circuits?
In DC circuits, capacitors block steady-state current flow after charging. In AC circuits, capacitors allow current to flow, with the amount depending on the frequency and capacitance. This behavior leads to the concept of capacitive reactance.
Analogy: A capacitor in a circuit resembles a flexible membrane in a pipe. In DC (steady flow), the membrane stretches to a point and stops flow. In AC (oscillating flow), the membrane flexes back and forth, allowing alternating flow.
Example: To demonstrate capacitor behavior in DC and AC:
a) Set up a circuit with a capacitor, resistor, and LED in series.
b) Connect to a DC power source and observe the LED briefly light up and then go dark.
c) Connect the same circuit to an AC power source (low voltage for safety).
d) Observe the LED remaining lit, indicating continuous current flow.

5. What is the energy stored in a capacitor?
The energy (E) stored in a capacitor equals half the product of capacitance (C) and the square of the voltage (V) across it: $E = \frac{1}{2}CV^2$
Analogy: This relationship resembles the potential energy of a stretched spring. The energy increases with the spring's stiffness (capacitance) and dramatically with how far it's stretched (voltage).
Example: Calculate the energy stored in a 470μF capacitor charged to 12V:
a) Use the formula $E = \frac{1}{2}CV^2$
b) Convert 470μF to farads: 470 × 10⁻⁶ F
c) Substitute the values: $E = \frac{1}{2} × 470 × 10^{-6} \text{ F} × (12 \text{ V})^2$
d) Perform the calculation: $E = 0.03384 \text{ J}$
e) The energy stored equals 0.03384 joules or 33.84 mJ.
