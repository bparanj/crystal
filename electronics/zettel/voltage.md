## Overview: Voltage

Voltage represents the measure of the potential energy per unit charge between two points in an electric field. It drives the movement of electrons through a circuit. Voltage is similar to the pressure pushing water through a pipe. In the context of circuits, voltage causes electrons to move, creating an electrical current. It is also known as electric potential difference.

## Atomic Ideas

1. What is Voltage?

   -  What does voltage represent in an electrical circuit?
   -  Voltage measures the potential difference between two points in a circuit. This potential difference indicates how much work one must perform to move a charge from one point to another.
   -  Imagine voltage as water pressure in a pipe. The higher the pressure (voltage), the more forcefully water (or electrons) moves through the pipe.
   - Example: In a simple flashlight circuit, the battery provides 1.5V. This means the battery creates a potential difference of 1.5 volts, pushing electrons through the bulb and causing it to light up.

2. How does Voltage Relate to Energy and Charge?

   -  How does voltage relate to energy and charge in a circuit?
   -  Voltage quantifies the amount of electrical potential energy per unit charge. Mathematically, $V = \frac{E}{Q}$, where $V$ represents voltage, $E$ represents electrical potential energy in joules, and $Q$ represents charge in coulombs.
   -  Think of voltage as the height from which water falls. The greater the height (voltage), the more energy the water (or charge) gains as it falls.
   - Example: If 2 joules of energy move through a circuit and 1 coulomb of charge passes, the voltage across the circuit is $V = \frac{2 \, \text{J}}{1 \, \text{C}} = 2 \, \text{V}$.

3. How does Voltage Drive Current?

   -  What role does voltage play in driving electrical current?
   -  Voltage creates the "push" that moves electrons, resulting in current flow. According to Ohm's Law, $V = IR$, where $V$ is voltage, $I$ is current, and $R$ is resistance.
   -  Voltage acts like a water pump pushing water through a hose. The higher the pressure (voltage), the faster the water flows (current), assuming the hose (resistance) stays the same.
   - Example: In a circuit with a resistance of 10 ohms and a voltage of 5V, the current is $I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{5 \, \text{V}}{10 \, \Omega} = 0.5 \, \text{A}$.

4. What are the Types of Voltage?

   -  What are the two primary types of voltage?
   -  The two primary types of voltage are Direct Current (DC) voltage and Alternating Current (AC) voltage. DC voltage maintains a constant polarity, while AC voltage periodically reverses its direction.
   -  DC voltage can be compared to a steady river flowing in one direction, whereas AC voltage is like the ocean tide, which moves back and forth.
   - Example: A battery provides DC voltage, while a household electrical outlet supplies AC voltage.

5. How does Voltage Affect Power?

   -  How does voltage affect the power in a circuit?
   -  Power, the rate of energy transfer, depends on both voltage and current. Mathematically, $P = VI$, where $P$ represents power in watts, $V$ represents voltage in volts, and $I$ represents current in amperes.
   -  Imagine voltage as the pressure of water in a hose and current as the flow of water. Power would then be the amount of water pushed through the hose every second.
   - Example: In a circuit with a 10V source and a current of 2A, the power is $P = 10 \, \text{V} \times 2 \, \text{A} = 20 \, \text{W}$.

## Solution: Calculating Voltage

### Problem Statement:

Given that the electric potential energy is 12 joules, and the charge is 4 coulombs, find the voltage.

### Solution:

The formula for voltage is:

$$ V = \frac{E}{Q} $$

Where:
- $V$ is voltage (in volts),
- $E$ is energy (in joules),
- $Q$ is charge (in coulombs).

Substitute the values:

$$ V = \frac{12 \, \text{J}}{4 \, \text{C}} = 3 \, \text{V} $$

Thus, the voltage is 3 volts.

Overview:

Voltage, also known as electrical potential difference, represents the energy per unit charge available to move electrons through a conductor. It serves as the driving force in electrical circuits, causing current to flow when a complete path exists. Measured in volts (V), voltage plays a crucial role in determining the behavior and capabilities of electrical systems.

Atomic Ideas:

1. What is the fundamental definition of voltage?

Voltage represents the electric potential difference between two points in an electrical circuit. It quantifies the energy required to move a unit charge from one point to another within an electric field.

 Voltage resembles the difference in water pressure between two points in a pipe system. Just as water flows from high pressure to low pressure, electrons move from high voltage to low voltage.

Example: To measure voltage between two points in a simple circuit:

a) Set up a circuit with a battery, resistor, and LED.
b) Connect the positive (red) probe of a multimeter to the positive terminal of the battery.
c) Connect the negative (black) probe to the negative terminal.
d) Set the multimeter to measure DC voltage.
e) Read the displayed value, which represents the voltage across the battery.

2. How does one express voltage mathematically?

The mathematical expression for voltage (V) equals the work done (W) to move a charge (Q) divided by the amount of that charge: $V = \frac{W}{Q}$

 This relationship resembles calculating the cost per item when shopping. If you spend $10 (work done) to buy 5 apples (charge), the cost per apple (voltage) equals $2.

Example: Calculate the voltage needed to move 3 coulombs of charge using 15 joules of energy:

a) Use the formula $V = \frac{W}{Q}$
b) Substitute the values: $V = \frac{15 \text{ J}}{3 \text{ C}}$
c) Perform the division: $V = 5 \text{ V}$
d) The voltage equals 5 volts.

3. What does Ohm's Law state about voltage?

Ohm's Law states that voltage (V) equals the product of current (I) and resistance (R): $V = I \times R$

 This relationship resembles water flow through a pipe. Voltage acts like water pressure, current like the water flow rate, and resistance like the pipe's diameter.
Example: Determine the voltage across a 100-ohm resistor with 0.5 amperes of current flowing through it:

a) Use Ohm's Law: $V = I \times R$
b) Substitute the values: $V = 0.5 \text{ A} \times 100 \text{ Ω}$
c) Perform the multiplication: $V = 50 \text{ V}$
d) The voltage across the resistor equals 50 volts.

4. How does one define electric potential energy in relation to voltage?

Electric potential energy represents the energy stored in a system of charged particles due to their positions within an electric field. Voltage quantifies the difference in this energy per unit charge between two points.

 Electric potential energy resembles the potential energy of a ball on a hill. The higher the ball's position (higher voltage), the more potential energy it possesses.

Example: Calculate the electric potential energy of a 2-coulomb charge in a 5-volt potential difference:

a) Use the formula: $E = Q \times V$
b) Substitute the values: $E = 2 \text{ C} \times 5 \text{ V}$
c) Perform the multiplication: $E = 10 \text{ J}$
d) The electric potential energy equals 10 joules.

5. What constitutes the relationship between voltage and electric field strength?

Electric field strength (E) equals the negative gradient of voltage (V) with respect to distance (d): $E = -\frac{dV}{dd}$

 This relationship resembles the steepness of a hill. The electric field strength corresponds to the slope, while voltage represents the height at different points.

Example: Calculate the electric field strength between two plates 2 cm apart with a potential difference of 100 volts:

a) Use the formula: $E = -\frac{ΔV}{Δd}$
b) Substitute the values: $E = -\frac{100 \text{ V}}{0.02 \text{ m}}$
c) Perform the division: $E = -5000 \text{ V/m}$
d) The electric field strength equals 5000 V/m (negative sign indicates direction).

2. Resistance: The opposition to current flow, measured in ohms (Ω). Resistance directly relates to voltage through Ohm's Law, affecting the voltage drop across components.
3. Capacitance: The ability to store electric charge, measured in farads (F). Capacitors store energy in electric fields, which relates to the concept of voltage as potential difference.
4. Power: The rate of energy transfer, measured in watts (W). Power in electrical systems depends on both voltage and current: P = V × I.
