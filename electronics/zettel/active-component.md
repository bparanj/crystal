An active electronic component is a device that can control or amplify electrical signals. It requires an external power source to operate. They can introduce energy into the circuit and manage the flow of current. Common examples are transistors and diodes. They are used in circuits to provide switching, amplification and regulation of electrical signals. They can modify electrical power within a circuit. Active component is like a pump in a water system that adds energy and controls the flow of water.

Passive components are like pipes that direct the flow of current.

A transistor is an active component. It requires an external power source to amplify electrical signals. It acts as a switch or amplifier in a circuit.

A transistor is a three terminal device. It has a base, collector and an emitter. It can switch or amplify signals. Apply a small current to the base, the transistor will allow a larger current to flow between the collector and the emitter. This controls the current in the circuit.

A diode allows current to flow in one direction. It blocks current in the opposite direction. This propery is used to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) in rectifier circuits. A diode is like a one-way valve in a plumbing system, where a water can only flow in one direction. In a power supply circuit, a diode is used to convert AC from a wall outles into DC that powers electronic devices such as a phone charger.

Active electronic components are devices that can control or amplify electrical signals and require an external power source. Examples include transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits. These components are crucial for switching, amplifying, and regulating electrical signals in circuits.

Transistors are active components that control large currents using a smaller input current. Diodes allow current to flow in one direction, making them useful for converting AC to DC. Integrated circuits combine multiple active elements to perform complex functions such as computation and signal processing.

In electronic circuits, active components like transistors and op-amps amplify signals, while diodes are used for directional control. These components, which require external power, are essential in both simple and complex electronic systems.
