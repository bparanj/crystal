An electrical signal is a time-varying voltage or current that carries information, typically represented as variations in electrical properties (amplitude, frequency, or phase) through a conductor or transmission medium.

DC (Direct Current) alone is not an electrical signal since it maintains a constant voltage/current level and doesn't vary with time. However, when DC is modulated or varied, it becomes a signal that can carry information.
