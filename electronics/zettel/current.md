## Overview: Current

Current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor, such as a wire, over time. It represents the movement of electrons due to an electric field or potential difference (voltage) applied across two points. The unit of current is the ampere (A), which measures how much charge passes through a point in the circuit per second. Electrical current can flow as direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) depending on whether the charge flows in one direction or oscillates back and forth.

## Atomic Ideas

What is current in the context of an electric circuit?

   Current is the rate at which electric charge flows through a conductor. It tells us how many coulombs of charge pass through a point in a circuit per second.

   Imagine water flowing through a pipe. The amount of water flowing past a point in the pipe per second is like the current in a wire.

   In a circuit with 2 coulombs of charge flowing through a wire every second, the current would be 2 amperes.

How is current measured in a circuit?

   Current is measured in amperes (A). One ampere represents one coulomb of charge passing through a point in one second.

   If you measure the flow of cars passing through a toll booth, one car per second would represent 1 "car per second." Similarly, 1 ampere is 1 coulomb per second.

   Using an ammeter, if the current in a circuit reads 3A, it means 3 coulombs of charge pass through a specific point in one second.

What are the two main types of electric current?

   There are two main types of current: Direct Current (DC) and Alternating Current (AC). In DC, current flows in one direction, while in AC, current alternates back and forth.

   Think of DC as water flowing steadily in one direction through a river, whereas AC is like ocean tides that move back and forth.

   A battery produces DC current, where the electrons flow in one direction. Household outlets provide AC, where the current alternates directions many times per second (60 Hz in most countries).

How does voltage influence the flow of current in a circuit?

   Voltage creates the potential difference that pushes current through a circuit. The higher the voltage, the more current can flow, assuming resistance stays constant. This relationship is described by Ohm's Law: $V = IR$, where $V$ is voltage, $I$ is current, and $R$ is resistance.

   Voltage acts like water pressure in a pipe. The higher the pressure, the more water flows, just like how a higher voltage drives more current through a circuit.

   In a circuit with a 9V battery and a resistor of 3 ohms, using Ohm's Law, $I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{9}{3} = 3A$, meaning 3 amperes of current flow through the resistor.

How is current related to electrical power?

   Electrical power, measured in watts (W), depends on both current and voltage. The formula $P = IV$ expresses this relationship, where $P$ is power, $I$ is current, and $V$ is voltage.

   Think of current as the flow of cars and voltage as the speed at which they travel. The faster the cars (voltage) and the more cars on the road (current), the greater the overall power on the road.

   In a circuit where 2A of current flows through a device connected to a 5V power source, the power is $P = IV = 2 \times 5 = 10W$. Thus, the device consumes 10 watts of power.

## Calculating Current

### Problem Statement:

In a circuit, a 12V battery is connected to a 6-ohm resistor. Calculate the current flowing through the circuit.

### Solution:

We use Ohm’s Law to find the current. The formula is:

$$ I = \frac{V}{R} $$

Where:

- $I$ is the current in amperes (A),
- $V$ is the voltage in volts (V),
- $R$ is the resistance in ohms ($\Omega$).

Substitute the given values:

$$ I = \frac{12 \, \text{V}}{6 \, \Omega} = 2 \, \text{A} $$

Thus, the current flowing through the circuit is 2 amperes.

Overview:

Measured in amperes (A), current plays a fundamental role in the functioning of electrical and electronic devices, determining the amount of electrical energy transferred through a system.

Atomic Ideas:

1. What defines electric current?

THIS EXPLANATION IS BETTER

Electric current represents the rate of flow of electric charge through a conductor. It measures the amount of charge passing through a cross-section of the conductor per unit time.
Analogy: Electric current resembles the flow of water through a pipe. Just as water flows from high pressure to low pressure, electric charge flows from high potential (voltage) to low potential.

Example: To observe electric current:

a) Set up a simple circuit with a battery, switch, and light bulb.
b) Connect the positive terminal of the battery to one end of the switch.
c) Connect the other end of the switch to one terminal of the light bulb.
d) Connect the other terminal of the light bulb to the negative terminal of the battery.
e) Close the switch and observe the light bulb illuminating, indicating current flow.

2. How does one express current mathematically?

The mathematical expression for current (I) equals the amount of charge (Q) flowing past a point divided by the time (t) taken: $I = \frac{Q}{t}$
Analogy: This relationship resembles calculating the speed of cars passing a point on a highway. If 100 cars (charge) pass in 2 hours (time), the flow rate (current) equals 50 cars per hour.

Example: Calculate the current when 10 coulombs of charge flow through a wire in 2 seconds:

a) Use the formula $I = \frac{Q}{t}$
b) Substitute the values: $I = \frac{10 \text{ C}}{2 \text{ s}}$
c) Perform the division: $I = 5 \text{ A}$
d) The current equals 5 amperes.

3. What does Ohm's Law state about current?

Ohm's Law states that current (I) equals voltage (V) divided by resistance (R): $I = \frac{V}{R}$
Analogy: This relationship resembles water flow through a pipe system. Current acts like the water flow rate, voltage like the water pressure difference, and resistance like the pipe's constriction.

Example: Determine the current flowing through a 20-ohm resistor with 5 volts across it:

a) Use Ohm's Law: $I = \frac{V}{R}$
b) Substitute the values: $I = \frac{5 \text{ V}}{20 \text{ Ω}}$
c) Perform the division: $I = 0.25 \text{ A}$
d) The current through the resistor equals 0.25 amperes.

4. How does one differentiate between direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC)?
Direct current (DC) flows consistently in one direction, while alternating current (AC) periodically reverses direction. DC maintains a constant polarity, whereas AC oscillates between positive and negative polarities at a specific frequency.

Analogy: DC resembles a river flowing consistently in one direction, while AC resembles ocean waves moving back and forth.
Example: To demonstrate the difference between DC and AC:

a) Set up two circuits: one with a battery (DC) and one with a wall outlet (AC).
b) Connect an LED to the battery circuit and observe steady illumination.
c) Connect an LED to the AC circuit through a rectifier and observe flickering (without the rectifier, the LED won't light up due to reverse bias in alternating cycles).
d) Use an oscilloscope to visualize the steady DC voltage and the sinusoidal AC voltage.

5. What constitutes the relationship between current density and current?

Current density (J) represents the amount of current (I) flowing per unit cross-sectional area (A) of a conductor: $J = \frac{I}{A}$

Analogy: Current density resembles the concentration of people moving through a doorway. A narrow doorway (small cross-sectional area) results in a higher density of people passing through, similar to how a thin wire results in higher current density.

Example: Calculate the current density in a wire with a cross-sectional area of 2 mm² carrying a current of 3 amperes:

a) Use the formula: $J = \frac{I}{A}$
b) Convert 2 mm² to m²: 2 × 10⁻⁶ m²
c) Substitute the values: $J = \frac{3 \text{ A}}{2 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^2}$
d) Perform the division: $J = 1.5 \times 10^6 \text{ A/m}^2$
e) The current density equals 1.5 million amperes per square meter.
