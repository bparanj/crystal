No, an operational amplifier (op-amp) is not strictly required to create a bipolar varying voltage source, but its use simplifies design and adds flexibility. Depending on the application and requirements, you can achieve a bipolar varying voltage source using alternative approaches:

### Scenarios Without an Op-Amp:

#### 1. Using a Transformer:
- A transformer can generate a bipolar signal by splitting the output into positive and negative halves.
- Method:
  - Apply an AC input to the primary winding.
  - Use a center-tapped secondary winding to create \( \pm V \) outputs.
- Applications:
  - Ideal for AC signals in power systems or audio applications.

#### 2. Using a Function Generator:
- Function generator ICs like the NE555 timer can produce square or triangular waves.
- Method:
  - Configure the NE555 timer in astable mode to generate oscillations.
  - Capacitively couple the output to remove DC offset, creating a bipolar waveform.
- Applications:
  - Generating simple waveforms without requiring amplification.

#### 3. Using Passive Components:
- A combination of resistors, capacitors, and diodes can manipulate an AC signal to create a bipolar waveform.
- Method:
  - Start with an AC voltage source.
  - Use RC or LC circuits for filtering or shaping the waveform.
- Limitations:
  - Less precision and limited control over amplitude and frequency.

### When to Avoid Using an Op-Amp:
1. Simpler Circuits:
   - For basic waveforms where precision is not critical, simpler circuits like an NE555 timer or transformer suffice.
2. Low-Cost Applications:
   - Avoid op-amps in cost-sensitive designs when passive or discrete-component alternatives work.

---

### Conclusion:
An operational amplifier is not strictly necessary for a bipolar varying voltage source, but it greatly simplifies the design, enhances precision, and adds flexibility. For low-complexity needs, alternative methods like transformers or function generator ICs can be sufficient.

Yes, an operational amplifier (op-amp) can minimize the number of components required to perform the experiment for a bipolar varying voltage source, especially when flexibility and precision are desired.

### Why an Op-Amp Reduces Components:

1. Integrated Feedback:
   - The op-amp combines amplification and waveform shaping in a single device. 
   - Feedback mechanisms (e.g., RC networks) directly modify behavior without requiring external amplifiers or complex networks.

2. Signal Conditioning:
   - The op-amp inherently handles impedance matching and scaling, eliminating the need for additional buffers or drivers.

3. Voltage Swing:
   - With a dual supply (\( \pm V_{supply} \)), the op-amp directly provides a clean bipolar output without extra DC coupling or offset circuits.

4. Versatility:
   - The same op-amp can be reconfigured for various waveforms (sine, square, triangular), avoiding multiple discrete circuit designs.

     - Additional coupling network for bipolar output.
     - Total: ~6-8 components.
  2. Transformer-Based Circuit:
     - 1 Transformer.
     - AC source.

### When to Use an Op-Amp:
1. Minimizing Components:
   - Op-amps consolidate functionality, reducing the overall part count.
2. Flexibility:
   - Easily reconfigurable for different waveforms.
3. Precision Requirements:
   - Produces stable and accurate bipolar signals.

### Conclusion:
In this case, an op-amp minimizes the component count while providing flexibility, stability, and precision. For simplicity and versatility in experimentation, it is often the most efficient choice.
