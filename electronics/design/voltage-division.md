## Voltage Division

What is voltage division in electronics

Voltage division is the principle where total voltage divides between series components proportionally to their resistance:

Formula:
- For a component: Vn = (Rn/RT) × VT
Where:
- Vn = Voltage across component
- Rn = Component resistance
- RT = Total series resistance
- VT = Total voltage

Example:
- If 12V is applied across two series resistors (100Ω and 200Ω):
- First resistor gets 4V (⅓ of voltage)
- Second resistor gets 8V (⅔ of voltage)

This follows from Kirchhoff's Voltage Law and Ohm's Law.
