Electromotive force (EMF) is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism and electrical engineering. Despite the term "force" in its name, EMF is a measure of the energy provided by a source, such as a battery or generator, to move electric charges through a circuit. It is the driving force that causes current to flow in a circuit.

Electromotive force (EMF) is the energy per unit charge that is supplied by a power source to move electrons through a circuit. It is  measured in volts (V), which is equivalent to joules per coulomb (J/C).

EMF is generated by sources such as batteries, generators, and solar cells. These sources convert different forms of energy (chemical, mechanical, or light energy) into electrical energy.

For example, in a battery, chemical reactions occur that create a potential difference between the two terminals, providing the energy needed to move electrons through a circuit.

While EMF is often referred to as the voltage of a power source, there is a subtle distinction. EMF refers to the total energy supplied to each coulomb of charge by the source, while "voltage" can also refer to the potential difference between any two points in a circuit.

In an ideal power source (with no internal resistance), the EMF is equal to the terminal voltage. However, in real sources with internal resistance, the terminal voltage is slightly less than the EMF when current is flowing, due to the voltage drop across the internal resistance.

The EMF (\( \mathcal{E} \)) of a source can be mathematically expressed as:
     \[
     \mathcal{E} = \frac{W}{Q}
     \]
     where:
     - \( \mathcal{E} \) is the electromotive force (in volts),
     - \( W \) is the work done or energy supplied (in joules),
     - \( Q \) is the charge (in coulombs).

Chemical EMF:

   In batteries, EMF is generated by chemical reactions that create a potential difference between the electrodes.

   - Induced EMF:

   In generators, EMF is induced by changing magnetic fields, according to Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction. This law states that a change in magnetic flux through a coil induces an EMF in the coil:
     \[
     \mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
     \]
     where \( \Phi_B \) is the magnetic flux.

EMF is the source of energy that pushes electrons through a circuit, overcoming the resistance of the circuit to maintain a flow of current. In a simple circuit with a battery, the EMF drives the current through the resistive elements, converting electrical energy into heat, light, or other forms of energy.

Real-world sources of EMF, like batteries, have internal resistance. This internal resistance causes a voltage drop within the source when current flows, meaning the terminal voltage (the voltage available to the external circuit) is slightly less than the EMF.
The terminal voltage \( V \) can be calculated using:
     \[
     V = \mathcal{E} - Ir
     \]
     where:
     - \( I \) is the current,
     - \( r \) is the internal resistance.

Electromotive force (EMF) is the measure of energy supplied by a power source to move electric charges through a circuit. It is a key concept in understanding how electrical energy is generated and used to drive current in circuits. While often used interchangeably with voltage, EMF specifically refers to the energy provided per unit charge by a source, such as a battery or generator. EMF is crucial for powering electrical devices, and it is the driving force behind the flow of current in a circuit.

Electromotive force (EMF) is a fundamental concept in electricity and magnetism. It's often misunderstood as a force, but it's ly a measure of energy per unit charge. Here's a concise explanation of EMF:

EMF is the energy provided by a source per unit electric charge. It's measured in volts (V).

Sources of EMF:

- Batteries
- Generators
- Solar cells
- Thermocouples
- Piezoelectric devices

- EMF drives electric current in a circuit
- It's the work done per unit charge to move charges from one terminal to another
- Often represented by the symbol ε (epsilon)

- EMF is the maximum potential difference a source can provide
- In an ideal source, EMF equals the terminal voltage
- In real sources, internal resistance causes a voltage drop

Faraday's law of induction:

- Changing magnetic flux through a conductor induces an EMF
- EMF = -N * (dΦ/dt), where N is the number of turns and Φ is magnetic flux

Applications:

- Power generation (e.g., in electrical generators)
- Battery operation
- Electromagnetic induction in transformers

- Measured using a voltmeter with very high internal resistance
- Potentiometer method for precise measurement
