### Experiment 1: Inductive Reactance

Objective: 

To observe how an inductor affects the current in an AC circuit.

Materials:

- AC power supply (function generator)
- Inductor (e.g., 100 mH)
- Resistor (e.g., 100 ohms)
- Oscilloscope
- Connecting wires

Procedure:

1. Set Up the Circuit: Connect the inductor and resistor in series with the AC power supply.
2. Measure Voltage and Current: Use the oscilloscope to measure the voltage across the resistor and the inductor.
3. Vary the Frequency: Adjust the frequency of the AC power supply and observe the changes in voltage and current.
4. Record Observations: Note how the current decreases as the frequency increases, indicating the increasing inductive reactance.

Inductive reactance (\( X_L \)) increases with frequency (\( X_L = 2\pi f L \)), causing the current to decrease as the frequency increases.
