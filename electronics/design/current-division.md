## Current Division

What is current division in electronics

Current division is the principle where total current divides between parallel branches inversely proportional to their resistance:

Formula:
- For a branch: In = (RT/Rn) × IT
Where:
- In = Current in the branch
- RT = Total parallel resistance
- Rn = Branch resistance
- IT = Total current

Example:
- If 10mA flows into two parallel resistors (100Ω and 200Ω):
- First branch gets 6.67mA (⅔ of current)
- Second branch gets 3.33mA (⅓ of current)

This follows from Kirchhoff's Current Law and Ohm's Law.
