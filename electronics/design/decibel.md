Decibels (dB) are used to measure power ratios in many fields, not just audio.

Decibels are used in:

1. Electronics & Communications

- Signal power in radio frequency (RF) systems
- Antenna gains
- Cable losses
- Network signal strength
- Power amplifier gains
- Signal-to-noise ratios

2. Audio (yes, this is one use)

- Sound pressure levels
- Speaker outputs
- Microphone sensitivity

3. Fiber Optics

- Optical power losses
- Signal attenuation in fibers

4. Radar Systems
- Return signal strength
- Radar cross-section measurements

The decibel (dB) is simply a logarithmic way to express any power ratio:

- dB = 10 * log₁₀(P₂/P₁)
- Used because it's convenient for large ranges of values
- Makes multiplication become addition (due to log properties)
- Easier to work with large dynamic ranges

For example, in RF systems:

- A 3dB gain means power doubles
- A -3dB loss means power halves
- This is true whether it's audio, radio, or optical power
