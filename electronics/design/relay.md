The simplest electronic circuit to learn about relays is using a relay to control a higher-power device with a lower-power signal. Let's design a basic circuit that demonstrates the basic operation of a relay.

This simple relay circuit consists of two main parts:

1. Control Circuit (Low power):

   - 5V power source (e.g., battery or power supply)
   - Switch
   - Relay coil

2. Load Circuit (Higher power):

   - 12V power source
   - Relay contact (switch controlled by the relay coil)
   - LED (representing the load)

Here's how this circuit works:

1. When the switch in the control circuit is open:

   - No current flows through the relay coil
   - The relay contact in the load circuit remains open
   - The LED is off

2. When the switch in the control circuit is closed:

   - Current flows through the relay coil, energizing it
   - The magnetic field created by the coil closes the relay contact in the load circuit
   - The LED turns on

Components needed:

1. 5V power source (for the control circuit)
2. 12V power source (for the load circuit)
3. SPST (Single Pole Single Throw) switch
4. Relay (5V coil voltage, contacts rated for at least 12V)
5. LED
6. Resistor (appropriate for the LED,  220Ω to 1kΩ)
7. Breadboard and jumper wires

Learning points:

1. Electrical isolation: The control circuit and load circuit are electrically isolated from each other.
2. Power amplification: A low-power signal (5V) controls a higher-power circuit (12V).
3. Switching: The relay acts as an electrically controlled switch.

This circuit demonstrates the basic principle of a relay: using a low-power signal to control a higher-power circuit. It's a foundational concept in electronics and automation.

To expand on this experiment, you could:

1. Add a flyback diode across the relay coil to protect against voltage spikes
2. Use the relay to control a motor or other high-power device instead of an LED
3. Implement transistor-based relay control for even lower power switching

Let's create a PySpice program to simulate this relay circuit. We'll model the relay as a voltage-controlled switch to represent its behavior.

```python
from PySpice.Spice.Netlist import Circuit
from PySpice.Unit import *

# Create a new circuit
circuit = Circuit('Relay Circuit Simulation')

# Define circuit parameters
V_control = 5@u_V  # 5V control voltage
V_load = 12@u_V  # 12V load voltage
R_coil = 100@u_Ω  # Relay coil resistance
R_led = 1@u_kΩ  # LED series resistor

# Create circuit elements
# Control Circuit
circuit.V('control', 'control_pos', 'gnd', V_control)
circuit.R('switch', 'control_pos', 'coil', 0.1@u_Ω)  # Small resistance to represent closed switch
circuit.R('coil', 'coil', 'gnd', R_coil)

# Load Circuit
circuit.V('load', 'load_pos', 'gnd', V_load)
circuit.R('led', 'load_pos', 'led_n', R_led)
circuit.VCVS('relay_switch', 'led_n', 'gnd', 'coil', 'gnd', voltage_gain=1000)  # Voltage-controlled switch

# Run the simulation
simulator = circuit.simulator(temperature=25, nominal_temperature=25)
analysis = simulator.transient(step_time=1@u_ms, end_time=50@u_ms)

# Extract time and voltage data
time = [float(t) for t in analysis.time]
v_coil = [float(analysis['coil']) for _ in analysis.time]
v_led = [float(analysis['led_n']) for _ in analysis.time]

# Plotting
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(time, v_coil, label='Coil Voltage')
plt.plot(time, v_led, label='LED Voltage')
plt.title('Relay Circuit Simulation')
plt.xlabel('Time (seconds)')
plt.ylabel('Voltage (V)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Print some key values
print(f"Steady-state coil voltage: {v_coil[-1]:.2f} V")
print(f"Steady-state LED voltage: {v_led[-1]:.2f} V")
print(f"Coil current: {v_coil[-1]/float(R_coil):.2f} A")
print(f"LED current: {(float(V_load) - v_led[-1])/float(R_led):.2f} A")

```

This PySpice script simulates our relay circuit.

1. We import necessary modules from PySpice and create a new Circuit object.

2. We define our circuit parameters using PySpice's unit system.

3. We create circuit elements for both the control and load circuits:
   - In the control circuit, we use a small resistance (0.1Ω) to represent the closed switch.
   - We model the relay as a Voltage Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS) with a high gain to simulate the switching behavior.

4. We run a transient analysis simulation for 50 milliseconds with 1ms steps.

5. We extract time and voltage data for the relay coil and LED from the simulation results.

6. We plot the results using Matplotlib, showing both the coil voltage and LED voltage over time.

7. Finally, we print some key values,  steady-state voltages and currents.

To run this simulation:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Install PySpice and Matplotlib if you haven't already:
   ```
   pip install PySpice matplotlib
   ```
3. Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., `pyspice_relay_simulation.py`).
4. Run the script:
   ```
   python pyspice_relay_simulation.py
   ```

This simulation provides a representation of the relay circuit behavior. The resulting graph will show how the voltages across the relay coil and LED change over time. You should see the coil voltage rise quickly as the switch closes, and the LED voltage drop as the relay switches on.

Key points to observe in the results:
1. The coil voltage should stabilize at slightly below 5V due to the coil resistance.
2. The LED voltage should drop from 12V to a lower value when the relay switches on.
3. The coil and LED currents can be calculated from the voltage drops and known resistances.

This simulation simplifies some aspects of real-world relay behavior, such as switching time and contact resistance, but it provides a good starting point for understanding relay circuits.
