LED (Light Emitting Diode) has polarity. This means it has a positive and a negative side, and it will only allow current to flow in one direction.

### Understanding LED Polarity

1. Anode (Positive Side):

The longer lead of an LED is  the anode, or the positive side. This is the side that should be connected to the positive terminal of a power source.

2. Cathode (Negative Side):

The shorter lead is usually the cathode, or the negative side. This side should be connected to the negative terminal of the power source.

3. Internal Structure:

Internally, LEDs are designed with a semiconductor junction that emits light when current flows through it. Because they are diodes, they only conduct current in one direction (from anode to cathode). If the polarity is reversed, the LED will not emit light because current cannot flow through it.

4. Visual Indicators:

Some LEDs have a flat edge on the side of the cathode or a slightly larger internal element on the cathode side to help identify polarity.

### Consequences of Incorrect Polarity

If you connect an LED with incorrect polarity (reverse bias), it will not light up, and if a high enough reverse voltage is applied, the LED could be damaged. Therefore, it is crucial to connect an LED correctly to ensure it functions properly and avoid potential damage.

1. New Component - LED:

The Light Emitting Diode (LED) is a polarized component, meaning it only allows current to flow in one direction. This introduces the concept of polarity in circuits.

2. Current-Limiting Resistor:

This resistor is crucial as it limits the current flowing through the LED, preventing it from burning out. It introduces the idea of component protection and current control.

3. Voltage Drop:

LEDs have a characteristic voltage drop ( around 2V for red LEDs). This introduces the concept of voltage division in a circuit.

4. Visible Output:

this circuit produces light, providing immediate feedback and a sense of accomplishment for beginners.

5. Ohm's Law Application:

Calculating the appropriate resistor value introduces practical application of Ohm's Law, a fundamental principle in electronics.

- Polarity matters: The LED must be connected the right way around (longer leg or flat side of the case to the positive).
- Component protection: The resistor protects the LED from too much current.
- Basic calculations: You need to calculate the correct resistor value based on your power supply voltage and LED specifications.

1. Builds on the basic closed circuit concept
2. Introduces a new, exciting component (LED)
3. Teaches current limiting
4. Provides visible feedback
5. Introduces slightly more complex circuit analysis

After understanding the basic series resistor circuit, the next circuit that beginners can learn is a LED circuit with a current-limiting resistor. This circuit introduces the concept of diodes (specifically Light Emitting Diodes or LEDs), current control, and the importance of protecting components.


Limits the amount of current flowing through the LED to prevent it from burning out. The value of the resistor is chosen based on the supply voltage and the forward voltage of the LED.

A diode that emits light when current flows through it in the forward direction. The LED has an anode (positive) and cathode (negative); current flows from anode to cathode.

- When the circuit is closed, current flows from the positive terminal of the battery, through the resistor, then through the LED, and back to the negative terminal.
- The LED lights up because current is flowing through it.
- The resistor ensures that the current is at a safe level for the LED.

### Choosing the Resistor Value:

To calculate the appropriate resistor value, you can use Ohm's Law, taking into account the forward voltage of the LED ( around 2V for red LEDs, but it varies by color) and the desired current (usually around 20mA or 0.02A for standard LEDs).

- Formula: \( R = \frac{V_{supply} - V_{LED}}{I_{LED}} \)
- Example: If using a 9V battery and an LED with a forward voltage of 2V and a desired current of 20mA:
  - \( R = \frac{9V - 2V}{0.02A} = \frac{7V}{0.02A} = 350 \Omega \)
  - The closest standard resistor value would be 330Ω or 390Ω.

This LED circuit is a great next step for beginners because it introduces several important concepts:

- Diodes: Learning how current flows in one direction only.
- Current Limiting: Understanding why resistors are important for protecting components.
- Practical Application: Seeing a tangible result (the LED lighting up) helps reinforce the concepts of voltage, current, and resistance.

Let's see how to calculate the resistor value and discuss appropriate battery voltage for our basic circuit.

To calculate the resistor value, we use Ohm's Law: V = I * R, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance. We'll rearrange this to R = V / I to find our resistor value.

1. Battery voltage:

A common choice for beginners is a 9V battery. It's readily available and safe for most basic circuits.

2. Desired current:

For a simple LED circuit, we  aim for around 20mA (0.02A) current. This is suitable for most standard LEDs.

Now, let's calculate:

1. First, we need to account for the LED's voltage drop. A typical red LED has a forward voltage of about 2V.

2. The voltage across the resistor will be:

   Battery Voltage - LED Voltage Drop = 9V - 2V = 7V

3. Now we can use Ohm's Law:

   R = V / I
   R = 7V / 0.02A
   R = 350 ohms

4. We round this to the nearest standard resistor value, which would be 330 ohms.

So, for a 9V battery and a standard red LED, we'd use a 330 ohm resistor.

Regarding battery voltage:

1. 9V is common and safe for beginners.
2. 3V (two 1.5V AA batteries in series) is also popular for simpler circuits.
3. 5V is common when using a USB power source or certain voltage regulators.

The choice depends on your specific needs:

- 3V is good for very simple circuits and is very safe.
- 9V provides more power for slightly more complex circuits.
- 5V is standard for many electronic components and microcontrollers.

For our basic LED circuit, any of these voltages would work, but we'd need to recalculate the resistor value for each:

- For 3V: R = (3V - 2V) / 0.02A = 50 ohms (use a standard 47 ohm resistor)
- For 5V: R = (5V - 2V) / 0.02A = 150 ohms

This diagram shows how the resistor value changes with different battery voltages, all driving the same LED with approximately 20mA of current.

These calculations assume a red LED with a 2V forward voltage. Different color LEDs may have different forward voltages, which would affect the resistor calculation.

### Correct Connection of LED and Resistor

1. Electrons Flow Direction:

While electrons flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of the power supply, the conventional current direction is considered to flow from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. This is important when considering how to connect components like LEDs, which have polarity.

2. LED Polarity:

   - Anode (Positive Side): The longer lead of the LED (or sometimes marked with a “+”) is the anode, which should be connected to the positive terminal of the power supply.
   - Cathode (Negative Side): The shorter lead of the LED (or sometimes marked with a flat edge on the LED housing or “-”) is the cathode, which should be connected towards the negative terminal of the power supply.

3. Resistor Placement:

   - You can place the resistor either before or after the LED in the circuit. The placement of the resistor in series with the LED will not affect the circuit’s operation as long as it is in line with the current path. The resistor’s role is to limit the current flowing through the LED to prevent it from burning out.

### Wiring Example

To wire your LED and resistor correctly:

- Option 1 (Resistor Before LED):

  - Connect the resistor to the positive terminal of the battery.
  - Connect the other end of the resistor to the anode (longer lead) of the LED.
  - Connect the cathode (shorter lead) of the LED to the negative terminal of the battery.

- Option 2 (Resistor After LED):

  - Connect the anode (longer lead) of the LED directly to the positive terminal of the battery.
  - Connect the cathode (shorter lead) of the LED to one end of the resistor.
  - Connect the other end of the resistor to the negative terminal of the battery.

Both configurations will work correctly because the resistor is in series with the LED, ensuring the current is limited, and the LED receives the proper polarity. Just make sure that the LED is connected with the correct orientation, with the anode connected towards the positive side and the cathode towards the negative side.

It might seem counterintuitive at first, but in a series circuit, it doesn't matter whether the resistor comes before or after the LED in terms of limiting current. The key here is understanding how a series circuit works.

### Why Resistor Placement Doesn't Matter in a Series Circuit

1. Series Circuit Behavior:

   - In a series circuit, all components are connected end-to-end in a single path for the current to flow. This means the same current flows through every component in the circuit.
   - The order of components in a series circuit does not change the current that flows through each component. This is because there is only one path for the current, so every component experiences the same current.

2. Role of the Resistor:

   - The resistor's job is to limit the amount of current flowing through the circuit. It does this by providing resistance to the current, which drops some of the voltage across itself.
   - Whether the current encounters the resistor before or after the LED, the resistor still reduces the overall current flowing through the entire series circuit to a safe level for the LED.

3. Voltage Distribution:

   - In a series circuit, the power supply voltage is divided among the components based on their resistance (Ohm's Law: \( V = IR \)).
   - The LED will drop a specific voltage (its forward voltage) when current flows through it, regardless of whether the resistor is before or after the LED.
   - The remaining voltage will drop across the resistor, ensuring that the total current is controlled.

### Practical Example

Consider a circuit with a 9V battery, a 220-ohm resistor, and an LED with a forward voltage of 2V.

- Current Calculation: The current in the circuit is determined by the total resistance and the supply voltage. The LED’s forward voltage drop (2V) and the resistor (220 ohms) together determine the total resistance and, consequently, the current.

  \[
  \text{Current (I)} = \frac{\text{Battery Voltage} - \text{LED Forward Voltage}}{\text{Resistor Value}}
  \]

  Plugging in the values:

  \[
  I = \frac{9V - 2V}{220 \, \Omega} = \frac{7V}{220 \, \Omega} \approx 0.032A \, (32 \, mA)
  \]

- Whether you connect the resistor before the LED or after, the current flowing through both the resistor and the LED is 32 mA. The resistor limits this current to prevent the LED from burning out, regardless of its position in the series.

in a series circuit, the current is the same through all components. The resistor will protect the LED by limiting the current flow, whether it is placed before or after the LED. Therefore, the resistor effectively controls the current throughout the entire circuit, ensuring safe operation for the LED.
