To illustrate why a good voltage source is a bad current source (and vice versa), here are two simple experiments you can set up:

### Voltage Source with Variable Load

Objective: Show that a good voltage source maintains a constant voltage but variable current with changes in load.

Components:

- DC Power Source (e.g., 9V battery)
- 3 Resistors with different values (e.g., 1 kΩ, 500 Ω, and 100 Ω)
- Multimeter (to measure current)

Steps:

1. Set Up the Voltage Source: Connect the 9V battery to a breadboard, with the positive terminal connected to the positive rail and the negative terminal connected to the ground rail.
2. Connect a Resistor as a Load: Start with the 1 kΩ resistor as the load across the battery.
3. Measure Voltage and Current: Measure the voltage across the resistor (it should be close to 9V) and measure the current through the resistor.
4. Change the Load: Replace the 1 kΩ resistor with the 500 Ω resistor and then the 100 Ω resistor, measuring the voltage and current each time.

Results:

- The voltage across the load remains nearly constant at 9V (good voltage source).
- The current changes significantly with each load, as the battery does not regulate current (poor current source behavior).
