A simple experiment to illustrate the electromagnetic force using basic materials:

### Experiment: Creating an Electromagnet

Objective: 

To demonstrate the electromagnetic force by creating a simple electromagnet.

Materials:

- Iron nail (about 3 inches long)
- Insulated copper wire (about 3 feet long)
- AA battery
- Small paper clips or metal pins

Procedure:

1. Wrap the Wire: 

Tightly wrap the insulated copper wire around the iron nail, leaving about 6 inches of wire free at each end. Make sure to wrap the wire in one direction only.

2. Strip the Ends: 

Strip about 1 inch of insulation from both ends of the wire to expose the copper.

3. Connect to Battery: 

Attach one end of the wire to the positive terminal of the AA battery and the other end to the negative terminal. This creates an electric current through the wire.

4. Test the Electromagnet: 

Bring the nail close to the small paper clips or metal pins. Observe how the nail, now an electromagnet, attracts the paper clips or pins.

When electric current flows through the copper wire, it generates a magnetic field around the wire. The iron nail enhances this magnetic field, turning it into an electromagnet. The electromagnetic force is strong enough to attract small metal objects like paper clips.
