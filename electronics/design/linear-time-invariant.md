## Linear and Time Invariant

What are linear and time invariant principles in the context of electronic circuits?

Linear and Time Invariant (LTI) principles in electronic circuits are:

Linearity:

- Output is proportional to input (scaling property)
- Superposition applies - response to sum of inputs equals sum of individual responses

Time Invariance:

- Circuit behavior doesn't change with time
- Delaying the input causes same delay in output with no other changes

Example: A basic RC or RL circuit is LTI because:

- Doubling input voltage doubles output voltage (linear)
- Response is same regardless of when signal is applied (time invariant)

Common non-LTI cases:

- Diodes (non-linear)
- Circuits with time-varying components (not time invariant)
