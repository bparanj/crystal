What is linear circuit theory?

Linear circuit theory is a fundamental framework for analyzing circuits that follow two key principles:

1. Superposition Principle:

- The response to multiple inputs equals the sum of responses to individual inputs
- Example: If input A causes output X, and input B causes output Y
- Then inputs (A+B) will cause output (X+Y)

2. Proportionality (Scaling):

- If input is scaled by factor k, output scales by same factor
- Example: If input A causes output X
- Then input (2A) causes output (2X)

Applications:

1. Analysis Methods:
- Mesh analysis
- Nodal analysis
- Thevenin/Norton equivalents
- Superposition theorem

2. Works with:

- Ideal resistors
- Ideal capacitors
- Ideal inductors
- Controlled sources
- Independent sources

3. Cannot Handle:

- Diodes
- Transistors (in general)
- Other non-linear devices
- Real-world component non-linearities

This theory is powerful because it allows:

- Simple mathematical analysis
- Use of complex numbers for AC analysis
- Breaking complex circuits into simpler parts
- Predictable behavior

Would you like me to explain any of these concepts in more detail?
