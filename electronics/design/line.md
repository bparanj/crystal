Yes, if you plot a graph of current (I) versus voltage (V) for a resistor, it will indeed be a straight line that passes through the origin, illustrating a linear relationship.

For a resistor following Ohm’s Law:
\[
V = I \cdot R
\]
we can rearrange it to express current in terms of voltage:
\[
I = \frac{V}{R}
\]
Here, current (I) is directly proportional to voltage (V), with \( \frac{1}{R} \) as the constant of proportionality.

### Relation to the Line Equation \( y = mx + c \)

In the context of this graph:
- The current (I) is the \( y \)-axis variable.
- The voltage (V) is the \( x \)-axis variable.
- \( \frac{1}{R} \) acts as the slope \( m \) of the line.
- The intercept (c) is 0, as the line passes through the origin.

This means:
\[
I = \frac{1}{R} \cdot V + 0
\]
So, the equation takes the form:
\[
y = mx + c
\]
where:
- \( m = \frac{1}{R} \),
- \( c = 0 \).

For a resistor, plotting current (I) against voltage (V) yields a straight line through the origin, confirming that it is a linear relationship with no intercept other than the origin. This behavior is characteristic of linear components, where the V-I relationship follows Ohm's Law.

Current is often placed on the y-axis in a current-voltage (I-V) plot because it aligns with the conventions used in physics and engineering to represent dependent and independent variables:

1. Ohm’s Law Convention:
   - Ohm’s Law, \( V = I \cdot R \), shows that current \( I \) depends on the applied voltage \( V \) across a resistor, making voltage the independent variable and current the dependent variable.
   - This leads us to plot voltage on the x-axis and current on the y-axis, following the convention that independent variables (inputs or controls) are on the x-axis, and dependent variables (outputs or responses) are on the y-axis.

2. General Plotting Conventions:
   - In a typical I-V plot, voltage is controlled (as we increase voltage, current changes accordingly), so voltage is treated as the x-axis variable.
   - This aligns with the broader plotting convention where the input or cause (voltage, in this case) is along the x-axis, while the response or effect (current) is plotted along the y-axis.

3. Experimental Setup:
   - In practical experiments and device testing, voltage is usually adjusted, and the resulting current is measured, which supports treating current as the dependent variable on the y-axis.

### Alternative Views

In some contexts, like semiconductor device physics (e.g., diode or transistor analysis), current may be controlled directly, so it could be on the x-axis in those cases. However, for linear resistive components, following Ohm’s Law convention, current is generally placed on the y-axis.

Yes, that’s correct! In most graphs, the x-axis represents the independent variable—the variable you change or control, which is thought to cause an effect on the y-axis, which represents the dependent variable.

### How It Works:

1. Independent Variable (x-axis):
   - This is the variable you choose or control in an experiment or relationship. It is often the cause in a cause-effect relationship.
   - By changing the value of the independent variable, you observe its effect on the dependent variable.

2. Dependent Variable (y-axis):
   - This variable responds to changes in the independent variable, and it is what you measure as the effect.
   - The dependent variable depends on the value of the independent variable, which is why it’s plotted on the y-axis.

### Example in Ohm’s Law (Voltage and Current):

For a resistor following Ohm’s Law:
\[
V = I \cdot R
\]
If we treat voltage (V) as the cause (independent variable), we control or vary the voltage to see how it affects the current (I), which is the effect (dependent variable).

In this case:
- Voltage (V) is on the x-axis (cause).
- Current (I) is on the y-axis (effect), as it changes in response to the applied voltage.

This setup aligns with the convention that the x-axis holds the independent variable, which causes changes in the dependent variable on the y-axis.
