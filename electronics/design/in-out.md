**Testing out of circuit** and **testing in circuit** are methods used to evaluate the functionality and performance of electronic components and circuits.

### 1. **Testing Out of Circuit**:
   - **Definition**: Testing out of circuit involves removing a component from the circuit board and testing it separately, outside the circuit.
   - **Purpose**: This method is used to measure the component's characteristics (like resistance, capacitance, or current gain) without interference from the surrounding circuit elements. It provides a more accurate reading of the component's  condition.
   - **When Used**: This approach is  used when there is a need to isolate a component to check for faults or verify its specifications. It is common in situations where in-circuit measurements might be influenced by parallel or series circuit elements.
   - **Tools Used**: Common tools for out-of-circuit testing include multimeters, capacitance meters, ESR meters, and transistor testers.

### 2. **Testing In Circuit**:
   - **Definition**: Testing in circuit means testing a component or portion of a circuit while it remains connected to the rest of the circuit. The tests are performed with the component in its operational position on the circuit board.
   - **Purpose**: This method is used to quickly diagnose issues or verify the performance of components within the context of the entire circuit. It helps to identify faults caused by component interaction, soldering issues, or incorrect circuit design.
   - **When Used**: In-circuit testing is often used for initial troubleshooting, quick checks, or when itâ€™s impractical to desolder components. It is common in manufacturing settings for quality control or when checking circuits under operational conditions.
   - **Tools Used**: In-circuit testing can be performed using multimeters, oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and in-circuit testers (ICTs) specifically designed to perform automated checks on populated boards.

### Summary:
- **Testing out of circuit** provides accurate measurements of individual components by removing them from their circuit, while **testing in circuit** evaluates components in their operational environment, which is quicker but might be less precise due to the influence of surrounding elements.
