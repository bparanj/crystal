An experiment to visualize magnetic fields using common materials:

### Experiment: Visualizing Magnetic Fields with Iron Filings

**Objective**: To observe the magnetic field lines around a magnet.

**Materials**:
- Bar magnet
- Iron filings
- White paper or a plastic sheet
- Compass (optional)

**Procedure**:
1. **Set Up the Paper**: Place the white paper or plastic sheet on a flat surface.
2. **Position the Magnet**: Place the bar magnet in the center of the paper.
3. **Sprinkle Iron Filings**: Gently sprinkle iron filings evenly around the magnet.
4. **Observe the Pattern**: Watch as the iron filings align themselves along the magnetic field lines, forming a pattern that shows the direction and shape of the magnetic field.
5. **Use a Compass (Optional)**: Move a compass around the magnet to see how the needle aligns with the magnetic field lines.

**Explanation**: The iron filings act as tiny magnets and align themselves along the magnetic field lines created by the bar magnet. This visually demonstrates the magnetic field, showing how it extends from the north pole to the south pole of the magnet.
