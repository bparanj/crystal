### R1(R2)-to-Voltage Converter

An R1(R2)-to-Voltage Converter is a circuit that converts the ratio of two resistances into a proportional voltage signal. This type of converter is commonly used in applications where resistive sensors or dividers provide an analog measurement based on the ratio of two resistors.

---

### Concepts

1. Resistive Ratio:
   - The ratio \( R_1 / R_2 \) determines the voltage output of the circuit.

2. Voltage Divider Principle:
   - The output voltage can be derived using the formula:
     \[
     V_{out} = V_{in} \cdot \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}
     \]
   - By carefully selecting \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), the output voltage becomes a function of their ratio.

3. Applications:
   - Resistive sensor interfacing (e.g., thermistors, strain gauges).
   - Analog signal processing.
   - Monitoring systems using resistive dividers.

### Circuit

#### Objective:
To design and simulate an R1(R2)-to-Voltage Converter and observe how the output voltage varies with the ratio of \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \).

#### Components:
1. DC Voltage Source (\( V_{in} = 5V \)).
2. Resistors:
   - \( R_1 = 1k\Omega \).
   - \( R_2 = 2k\Omega \) (variable to observe changes).
3. Multimeter to measure the output voltage.
4. Breadboard and wires.

### Circuit

1. Voltage Divider:
   - Connect \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) in series.
   - Connect the positive terminal of \( V_{in} \) to one end of \( R_1 \).
   - Connect the other end of \( R_1 \) to one end of \( R_2 \).

2. Output Voltage:
   - Take the output voltage (\( V_{out} \)) from the junction between \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \).

3. Ground Reference:
   - Connect the free end of \( R_2 \) to the ground terminal of \( V_{in} \).

---

### Steps

1. Set Up the Circuit:
   - Build the circuit as described above.

2. Apply Input Voltage:
   - Set \( V_{in} = 5V \) using the DC voltage source.

3. Measure Output Voltage:
   - Use a multimeter to measure \( V_{out} \).

4. Experiment with Resistor Values:
   - Replace \( R_2 \) with different values (\( 1k\Omega, 2k\Omega, 5k\Omega \)).
   - Record \( V_{out} \) for each configuration.

5. Vary \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) Ratios:
   - Observe how the output voltage changes as the ratio \( R_1 / R_2 \) is modified.

---

### Results:

1. Output Voltage:
   - The output voltage is proportional to the ratio of \( R_2 \) to \( R_1 + R_2 \):
     \[
     V_{out} = V_{in} \cdot \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}
     \]
   - For \( V_{in} = 5V \):
     - \( R_1 = 1k\Omega, R_2 = 2k\Omega \):
       \[
       V_{out} = 5V \cdot \frac{2k\Omega}{1k\Omega + 2k\Omega} = 3.33V
       \]
     - \( R_1 = 2k\Omega, R_2 = 1k\Omega \):
       \[
       V_{out} = 5V \cdot \frac{1k\Omega}{2k\Omega + 1k\Omega} = 1.67V
       \]

2. Linear Response:
   - \( V_{out} \) changes predictably based on the resistance ratio.

3. Effect of Resistor Values:
   - Larger \( R_2 \) increases \( V_{out} \), while larger \( R_1 \) decreases \( V_{out} \).

---

### Insights:

1. Ratio Sensitivity:
   - The circuit provides a direct relationship between resistance ratio and output voltage, making it ideal for monitoring resistive changes.

2. Resistor Selection:
   - Use precision resistors for applications requiring high accuracy.

3. Applications:
   - Widely used in resistive sensor circuits, where \( R_1 \) or \( R_2 \) changes based on environmental conditions.

This experiment can be implemented in Tinkercad, where you can dynamically vary resistor values and observe the effect on \( V_{out} \), demonstrating the principle of R1(R2)-to-Voltage conversion.
