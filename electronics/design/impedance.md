Impedance is provided by three main electronic components:

1. Resistors: 

Provide pure resistance, opposing both AC and DC current without affecting the phase. Their impedance is simply their resistance value, constant across frequencies.

2. Capacitors: 

Provide capacitive reactance, which creates impedance that varies inversely with frequency. Capacitors block low frequencies while allowing high frequencies to pass, and their impedance decreases as frequency increases.

3. Inductors: 

Provide inductive reactance, creating impedance that increases with frequency. Inductors oppose changes in current, blocking high frequencies while allowing low frequencies to pass.

Together, resistors, capacitors, and inductors can control the amplitude and phase of signals in AC circuits by creating impedance, which is the combination of resistance and reactance.
