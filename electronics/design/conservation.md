- State the Law of Conservation of Energy

The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. The total energy in an isolated system remains constant.

- Is this easy to understand?
- What is a physical system?

A physical system is a portion of the physical universe chosen for analysis, which is separated from its surroundings by a defined boundary. It can be as small as an atom or as large as a galaxy.

- What does energy is a property of physical system mean?

Energy is a measurable characteristic or attribute inherent to a physical system that indicates its capacity to perform work, change its state, or influence other systems. Like temperature or mass, it's a fundamental quantity that describes the system's condition.

- What is time invariance symmetry

Time invariance symmetry means that the laws of physics remain the same regardless of when they are observed or applied - they work the same way yesterday, today, and tomorrow. This principle ensures that the same experiment performed at different times will yield the same results.

Energy has different forms:

Kinetic energy - motion
Potential energy - position
Thermal energy - heat
Chemial energy - ?

Energy can change from one form to another. The total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant.

Closed system is a system that does not exchange matter or energy with its surroundings. The total amount of energy remains constant over time. This means that energy can transform from one type to another, but the total sum of energy in the system will remain the same.

First Law of Thermodynamics

The total energy of an isolated system is constant. It implies that the energy lost in one form is gained in another form. For example, mechanical work is converted to heat energy.


OUT OF SCOPE

By understanding that Kirchhoff's Laws are grounded in these fundamental conservation principles, one can see that these laws are not just arbitrary rules but are essential reflections of the natural laws governing charge and energy.

The principle that energy can neither be created nor destroyed is known as the **Law of Conservation of Energy**. This law is a fundamental concept in physics and can be understood through several key points:

### 1. **Nature of Energy**
   - Energy is a property of physical systems that can manifest in various forms such as kinetic energy (motion), potential energy (position), thermal energy (heat), chemical energy, and others. While energy can change from one form to another, the total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant.

### 2. **Closed Systems**
   - In a closed system, which is a system that does not exchange matter or energy with its surroundings, the total amount of energy remains constant over time. This means that energy can transform from one type to another, but the total sum of energy in the system will not change.

### 3. **First Law of Thermodynamics**
   - The Law of Conservation of Energy is formally stated in the **First Law of Thermodynamics**, which says that the total energy of an isolated system is constant. It also implies that the energy lost in one form (e.g., mechanical work) is gained in another form (e.g., heat).

### 4. **Empirical Evidence**
   - The conservation of energy has been repeatedly confirmed through countless experiments and observations across different fields of physics. No experiment has ever shown a violation of this principle, making it a reliable foundation for scientific understanding.

### 5. **Mathematical Framework**
   - In physics, the conservation laws, the conservation of energy, can be derived from fundamental symmetries in nature. According to **Noether's Theorem**, for every symmetry in the laws of physics, there is a corresponding conservation law. The conservation of energy corresponds to the time invariance symmetryâ€”meaning the laws of physics do not change over time.

### 6. **Implications in Various Fields**
   - In mechanics, conservation of energy explains phenomena such as why a pendulum swings back and forth without gaining or losing energy (ignoring air resistance and friction). In electrical circuits, it ensures that all energy supplied by a power source is converted into other forms (e.g., light, heat) without any loss of energy from the system.

The law reflects an universal truth about the nature of the universe. While energy can change forms and be transferred between objects and systems, the total energy remains unchanged, demonstrating a fundamental property of reality.
