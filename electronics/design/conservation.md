- State the Law of Conservation of Energy

The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. The total energy in an isolated system remains constant.

- Is this easy to understand?
- What is a physical system?

A physical system is a portion of the physical universe chosen for analysis, which is separated from its surroundings by a defined boundary. It can be as small as an atom or as large as a galaxy.

- What does energy is a property of physical system mean?

Energy is a measurable characteristic or attribute inherent to a physical system that indicates its capacity to perform work, change its state, or influence other systems. Like temperature or mass, it's a fundamental quantity that describes the system's condition.

- What is time invariance symmetry

Time invariance symmetry means that the laws of physics remain the same regardless of when they are observed or applied - they work the same way yesterday, today, and tomorrow. This principle ensures that the same experiment performed at different times will yield the same results.

Energy has different forms:

Kinetic energy - motion
Potential energy - position
Thermal energy - heat
Chemial energy - ?

Energy can change from one form to another. The total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant.

Closed system is a system that does not exchange matter or energy with its surroundings. The total amount of energy remains constant over time. This means that energy can transform from one type to another, but the total sum of energy in the system will remain the same.

First Law of Thermodynamics

The total energy of an isolated system is constant. It implies that the energy lost in one form is gained in another form. For example, mechanical work is converted to heat energy.
