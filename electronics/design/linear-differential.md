What are linear differential equation?

Linear differential equations are equations where the unknown function and its derivatives appear to the first power only (no squares, cubes, etc). They're crucial in circuit analysis.

Key characteristics:
1. Form: 
- an(x)y⁽ⁿ⁾ + an-1(x)y⁽ⁿ⁻¹⁾ + ... + a1(x)y' + a0(x)y = f(x)
- where y is the unknown function
- y', y'', etc. are its derivatives
- an(x), an-1(x), etc. are coefficients

2. Properties:
- Follows superposition principle
- No products of y or its derivatives
- No functions like sin(y) or e^y
- Solutions can be added together

Circuit Examples:
1. RC Circuit:
- RC(dv/dt) + v = V(t)
- First-order linear differential equation
- Describes capacitor voltage

2. RLC Circuit:
- L(d²i/dt²) + R(di/dt) + (1/C)i = V(t)
- Second-order linear differential equation
- Describes current flow

These equations are solvable using:
- Direct integration
- Laplace transforms
- Numerical methods

Would you like me to explain how these equations are solved or give more circuit examples?
