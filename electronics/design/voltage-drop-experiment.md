A simple experiment to illustrate the concept of **voltage drop**:

### Objective:
To demonstrate how voltage decreases across components in a series circuit, illustrating the concept of voltage drop.

### Materials Needed:
- A 9V battery or a DC power supply
- Two resistors of different values (e.g., 100 ohms and 200 ohms)
- A breadboard (optional)
- A multimeter to measure voltage
- Connecting wires

### Procedure:

1. **Set Up the Circuit**:
   - Connect the 9V battery or DC power supply to the breadboard.
   - Place the two resistors in series on the breadboard. To do this, connect one end of the first resistor to the positive terminal of the battery or power supply.
   - Connect the free end of the first resistor to one end of the second resistor. Connect the free end of the second resistor to the negative terminal of the battery or power supply.

2. **Measure the Total Voltage**:
   - Use the multimeter to measure the total voltage across the two resistors. Place the multimeter probes across the positive terminal of the battery and the connection point between the second resistor and the negative terminal. Record this voltage, which should be approximately 9V.

3. **Measure the Voltage Drop Across Each Resistor**:
   - First, measure the voltage drop across the first resistor (100 ohms). Place one probe of the multimeter on the positive terminal of the battery and the other probe on the junction between the two resistors. Record the voltage drop.
   - Next, measure the voltage drop across the second resistor (200 ohms). Place one probe on the junction between the two resistors and the other probe on the negative terminal of the battery. Record this voltage drop.

4. **Compare the Voltage Drops**:
   - Observe how the voltage drops across each resistor add up to the total voltage of the battery. Notice that the voltage drop across the 200-ohm resistor is higher than the voltage drop across the 100-ohm resistor. This demonstrates that the voltage drop is proportional to the resistance in a series circuit.

### Explanation:
This experiment illustrates the concept of **voltage drop** in a simple series circuit. When resistors are connected in series, the total voltage supplied by the battery is divided among the resistors. The voltage drop across each resistor depends on its resistance, following Ohm’s Law (\( V = IR \)). The resistor with higher resistance (200 ohms) has a greater voltage drop compared to the resistor with lower resistance (100 ohms). This shows how voltage is "used up" as current flows through resistive elements in a circuit. The total voltage drop across all components in a series circuit will always equal the supply voltage.
