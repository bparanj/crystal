### Experiment 2: Capacitive Reactance

Objective: 

To observe how a capacitor affects the current in an AC circuit.

Materials:

- AC power supply (function generator)
- Capacitor (e.g., 10 µF)
- Resistor (e.g., 100 ohms)
- Oscilloscope
- Connecting wires

Procedure:

1. Set Up the Circuit: Connect the capacitor and resistor in series with the AC power supply.
2. Measure Voltage and Current: Use the oscilloscope to measure the voltage across the resistor and the capacitor.
3. Vary the Frequency: Adjust the frequency of the AC power supply and observe the changes in voltage and current.
4. Record Observations: Note how the current increases as the frequency increases, indicating the decreasing capacitive reactance.

Capacitive reactance (\( X_C \)) decreases with frequency (\( X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f C} \)), causing the current to increase as the frequency increases.

These experiments help visualize how inductors and capacitors react differently to changes in frequency, illustrating the concept of reactance in AC circuits.

Capacitive reactance (Xc) is the opposition a capacitor offers to alternating current (AC). It varies inversely with frequency and capacitance:

Xc = 1/(2πfC)
where:

- Xc is capacitive reactance in ohms (Ω)
- f is frequency in hertz (Hz)
- C is capacitance in farads (F)

Main points:

- Decreases as frequency increases
- Decreases as capacitance increases
- Acts like a variable resistor that depends on frequency
- Causes current to lead voltage by 90 degrees in AC circuits

As frequency increases, capacitive reactance (Xc) decreases according to Xc = 1/(2πfC). By Ohm's law, I = V/Xc, so when Xc decreases, current increases.

Think of it this way: Higher frequency means the voltage changes direction more often, giving electrons less time to build up on the capacitor plates. This allows more current to flow through the circuit.

Example: If frequency doubles:

- Reactance becomes half (Xc = 1/2)
- Current doubles (I = 2)
