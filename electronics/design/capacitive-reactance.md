A simple experiment to demonstrate reactance in a capacitor using Tinkercad involves creating an AC circuit with a capacitor and observing how the capacitor affects the current and voltage. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Components Needed:
- Breadboard
- AC power source (e.g., function generator)
- Capacitor (e.g., 100 µF)
- Resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ)
- Wires
- Multimeter (to measure voltage and current)

### Steps:

1. **Set Up the Circuit**:
   - Place the resistor and capacitor in series on the breadboard.
   - Connect the AC power source to the series combination of the resistor and capacitor.
   - Connect the multimeter in series to measure the current and in parallel across the capacitor to measure the voltage.

2. **Run the Simulation**:
   - In Tinkercad, set up the components as described above.
   - Configure the AC power source to a specific frequency (e.g., 50 Hz or 60 Hz).
   - Run the simulation and observe the voltage across the capacitor and the current through the circuit.

### Observations:
- **Voltage and Current Phase Difference**: You will notice that the voltage across the capacitor and the current through the circuit are not in phase. The current leads the voltage in a capacitive circuit.
- **Reactance**: The capacitive reactance (\(X_C\)) can be calculated using the formula \(X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi fC}\), where \(f\) is the frequency of the AC source and \(C\) is the capacitance. This reactance affects the amplitude of the current and voltage.

### Explanation:
- **Capacitive Reactance**: Reactance is the opposition that a capacitor offers to the flow of AC current. It depends on the frequency of the AC signal and the capacitance. Higher frequencies result in lower reactance, allowing more current to pass through.
- **Phase Difference**: In a purely capacitive circuit, the current leads the voltage by 90 degrees. This phase difference is a key characteristic of capacitive reactance.

### Using Tinkercad:
1. **Create the Circuit**: Use the Tinkercad interface to place the components on the virtual breadboard.
2. **Simulate**: Run the simulation to observe the phase difference and the effect of reactance. Use the virtual multimeter to measure the voltage and current.

This experiment helps visualize how capacitors behave in AC circuits and demonstrates the concept of reactance effectively.

### Experiment Capacitive Reactance

Objective:

To observe how a capacitor affects the current in an AC circuit.

Materials:

- AC power supply (function generator)
- Capacitor (e.g., 10 µF)
- Resistor (e.g., 100 ohms)
- Oscilloscope
- Connecting wires

Procedure:

1. Connect the capacitor and resistor in series with the AC power supply.

2. Measure Voltage and Current:

Use the oscilloscope to measure the voltage across the resistor and the capacitor.

3. Vary the Frequency:

Adjust the frequency of the AC power supply and observe the changes in voltage and current.

PENDING

Oscilloscope can only show the voltage and current. Modification required for the experiment.

4. Record Observations:

Note how the current increases as the frequency increases, indicating the decreasing capacitive reactance.

Capacitive reactance (\( X_C \)) decreases with frequency (\( X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f C} \)), causing the current to increase as the frequency increases.

These experiments help visualize how inductors and capacitors react differently to changes in frequency, illustrating the concept of reactance in AC circuits.

Capacitive reactance (Xc) is the opposition a capacitor offers to alternating current (AC). It varies inversely with frequency and capacitance:

Xc = 1/(2πfC)
where:

- Xc is capacitive reactance in ohms (Ω)
- f is frequency in hertz (Hz)
- C is capacitance in farads (F)

Main points:

- Decreases as frequency increases
- Decreases as capacitance increases
- Acts like a variable resistor that depends on frequency
- Causes current to lead voltage by 90 degrees in AC circuits

As frequency increases, capacitive reactance (Xc) decreases according to Xc = 1/(2πfC). By Ohm's law, I = V/Xc, so when Xc decreases, current increases.

Higher frequency means the voltage changes direction more often, giving electrons less time to build up on the capacitor plates. This allows more current to flow through the circuit.

Example:

If frequency doubles:

- Reactance becomes half (Xc = 1/2)
- Current doubles (I = 2)
