### Experiment 2: Capacitive Reactance
**Objective**: To observe how a capacitor affects the current in an AC circuit.

**Materials**:
- AC power supply (function generator)
- Capacitor (e.g., 10 ÂµF)
- Resistor (e.g., 100 ohms)
- Oscilloscope
- Connecting wires

**Procedure**:
1. **Set Up the Circuit**: Connect the capacitor and resistor in series with the AC power supply.
2. **Measure Voltage and Current**: Use the oscilloscope to measure the voltage across the resistor and the capacitor.
3. **Vary the Frequency**: Adjust the frequency of the AC power supply and observe the changes in voltage and current.
4. **Record Observations**: Note how the current increases as the frequency increases, indicating the decreasing capacitive reactance.

**Explanation**: Capacitive reactance (\( X_C \)) decreases with frequency (\( X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f C} \)), causing the current to increase as the frequency increases.

These experiments help visualize how inductors and capacitors react differently to changes in frequency, illustrating the concept of reactance in AC circuits.
