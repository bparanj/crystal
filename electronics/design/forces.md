The basic forces of nature, also known as the fundamental forces, are the four fundamental interactions that govern how particles and objects interact in the universe. They are:

1. **Gravitational Force**: 
   - This force attracts two masses toward each other. It governs the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light under certain conditions. It is the weakest of the four forces but has an infinite range and affects all matter with mass.

2. **Electromagnetic Force**: 
   - This force occurs between electrically charged particles. It is responsible for electricity, magnetism, and light, and governs the behavior of charged particles in atoms and molecules. It has an infinite range and is much stronger than gravity.

3. **Strong Nuclear Force**: 
   - This force binds protons and neutrons together in an atom’s nucleus. It is the strongest of the four forces but has a very short range, acting only over distances the size of an atomic nucleus (about \(10^{-15}\) meters).

4. **Weak Nuclear Force**: 
   - This force is responsible for radioactive decay and nuclear fusion in stars. It has a very short range (less than \(10^{-18}\) meters) and is stronger than gravity but weaker than both the electromagnetic force and the strong nuclear force.

These four forces are the fundamental interactions that explain all physical phenomena in the universe.

Here’s a table to compare and contrast the four fundamental forces of nature, ordered from strongest to weakest:

| **Force**               | **Relative Strength** | **Range**                | **Acts On**                                  | **Key Role**                                  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Strong Nuclear Force**| 1 (Strongest)         | Very short (up to \(10^{-15}\) meters) | Quarks and gluons (within protons and neutrons) | Binds protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus |
| **Electromagnetic Force**| \(10^{-2}\)           | Infinite                 | Electrically charged particles (like electrons and protons) | Governs atomic and molecular interactions, electricity, and magnetism |
| **Weak Nuclear Force**  | \(10^{-6}\)           | Very short (up to \(10^{-18}\) meters) | Quarks and leptons                             | Responsible for radioactive decay and nuclear fusion processes |
| **Gravitational Force** | \(10^{-39}\)          | Infinite                 | All particles with mass                      | Governs the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and large-scale structures in the universe |

### Key Points from the Table:
- **Relative Strength**: The forces are listed in descending order of strength. The strong nuclear force is the strongest, and gravity is the weakest.
- **Range**: The strong and weak nuclear forces have very short ranges, limited to subatomic distances. The electromagnetic and gravitational forces have infinite ranges.
- **Acts On**: Each force acts on different particles. The strong nuclear force affects quarks and gluons inside the nucleus, the electromagnetic force affects charged particles, the weak nuclear force affects quarks and leptons, and gravity affects all particles with mass.
- **Key Role**: Each force plays a distinct role in nature, from holding atomic nuclei together to governing the structure and behavior of the cosmos.
