The basic forces of nature, also known as the fundamental forces, are the four fundamental interactions that govern how particles and objects interact in the universe. They are:

1. Gravitational Force:

   - This force attracts two masses toward each other. It governs the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light under certain conditions. It is the weakest of the four forces but has an infinite range and affects all matter with mass.

2. Electromagnetic Force:

   - This force occurs between electrically charged particles. It is responsible for electricity, magnetism, and light, and governs the behavior of charged particles in atoms and molecules. It has an infinite range and is much stronger than gravity.


| Force               | Relative Strength | Range                | Acts On                                  | Key Role                                  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Electromagnetic Force| \(10^{-2}\)           | Infinite                 | Electrically charged particles (like electrons and protons) | Governs atomic and molecular interactions, electricity, and magnetism |
| Gravitational Force | \(10^{-39}\)          | Infinite                 | All particles with mass                      | Governs the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and large-scale structures in the universe |


- Relative Strength:

The forces are listed in descending order of strength. The strong nuclear force is the strongest, and gravity is the weakest.

- Range:

The strong and weak nuclear forces have very short ranges, limited to subatomic distances. The electromagnetic and gravitational forces have infinite ranges.

- Acts On:

Each force acts on different particles. The strong nuclear force affects quarks and gluons inside the nucleus, the electromagnetic force affects charged particles, the weak nuclear force affects quarks and leptons, and gravity affects all particles with mass.

- Role:

Each force plays a distinct role in nature, from holding atomic nuclei together to governing the structure and behavior of the cosmos.
