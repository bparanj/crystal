The basic forces of nature, also known as the fundamental forces, are the four fundamental interactions that govern how particles and objects interact in the universe. They are:

1. Gravitational Force:

   - This force attracts two masses toward each other. It governs the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light under certain conditions. It is the weakest of the four forces but has an infinite range and affects all matter with mass.

2. Electromagnetic Force:

   - This force occurs between electrically charged particles. It is responsible for electricity, magnetism, and light, and governs the behavior of charged particles in atoms and molecules. It has an infinite range and is much stronger than gravity.


| Force               | Relative Strength | Range                | Acts On                                  | Key Role                                  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Electromagnetic Force| \(10^{-2}\)           | Infinite                 | Electrically charged particles (like electrons and protons) | Governs atomic and molecular interactions, electricity, and magnetism |
| Gravitational Force | \(10^{-39}\)          | Infinite                 | All particles with mass                      | Governs the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and large-scale structures in the universe |


The forces are listed in descending order of strength. Gravity is the weakest.

The electromagnetic and gravitational forces have infinite ranges.

Each force acts on different particles. the electromagnetic force affects charged particles and gravity affects all particles with mass.
