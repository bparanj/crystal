### Inductive Voltage-to-Voltage (V-to-V) Integrator

An Inductive V-to-V Integrator is a circuit that integrates an input voltage signal over time, producing an output voltage proportional to the time integral of the input. This is achieved using an inductor and a resistor in a specific configuration, leveraging the relationship between an inductor's current and the integral of the input voltage.

### Concepts

1. Inductor Behavior:
   - The current through an inductor is the integral of the input voltage:
     \[
     I(t) = \frac{1}{L} \int V_{in}(t) \, dt
     \]
   - This current flows through a load resistor (\( R \)), producing an output voltage.

2. Output Voltage:
   - The output voltage (\( V_{out} \)) is proportional to the integrated input voltage:
     \[
     V_{out} = R \cdot I(t) = \frac{R}{L} \int V_{in}(t) \, dt
     \]

3. Applications:
   - Signal integration in analog circuits.
   - Waveform shaping in audio and communication systems.
   - Analog computation.

### Experiment

#### Objective:
To design and simulate an Inductive V-to-V Integrator and observe how the output voltage responds to an input signal.

#### Components:
1. AC Voltage Source (\( V_{in} \), sinusoidal or square wave).
2. Inductor (\( L = 10mH \)).
3. Resistor (\( R = 1k\Omega \)).
4. Oscilloscope (to observe input and output waveforms).
5. Breadboard and wires.

### Circuit

1. Input Voltage:
   - Connect the AC voltage source to one terminal of the inductor (\( L \)).

2. Inductive Integration:
   - Connect the other terminal of the inductor to one end of the resistor (\( R \)).
   - Connect the free end of \( R \) to ground.

3. Output Voltage:
   - Take the output voltage (\( V_{out} \)) across the resistor.

4. Oscilloscope Connections:
   - Channel 1: Monitor the input voltage (\( V_{in} \)).
   - Channel 2: Monitor the output voltage (\( V_{out} \)).

### Steps

1. Set Up the Circuit:
   - Build the circuit on a breadboard as described.

2. Apply Input Voltage:
   - Use an AC voltage source to generate a sinusoidal or square wave signal (\( 5V_{peak}, 1kHz \)).

3. Observe Output:
   - Use an oscilloscope to monitor:
     - The input voltage (\( V_{in} \)).
     - The output voltage (\( V_{out} \)).

4. Experiment with Components:
   - Replace \( L \) (\( 5mH, 20mH \)) and \( R \) (\( 500\Omega, 2k\Omega \)) to observe changes in integration behavior.
   - Adjust the input frequency to study frequency dependence.

---

### Results:

1. Sinusoidal Input:
   - For \( V_{in}(t) = V_{peak} \sin(\omega t) \):
     \[
     V_{out}(t) = \frac{R}{\omega L} V_{peak} \cos(\omega t)
     \]
   - The output voltage is phase-shifted by \( 90^\circ \) (cosine wave) and its amplitude decreases with increasing frequency.

2. Square Wave Input:
   - The output voltage resembles a triangular wave, as the integral of a constant input is a ramp.

3. Effect of Component Values:
   - Larger \( L \): Slower integration, smaller \( V_{out} \).
   - Larger \( R \): Larger \( V_{out} \).

---

### Insights:

1. Frequency Dependence:
   - The output amplitude decreases with increasing input frequency because the integration effect is inversely proportional to frequency.

2. Inductor Selection:
   - Choose \( L \) based on the desired time constant and integration range.

3. Applications:
   - Used in signal integration, waveform shaping, and analog computation.
