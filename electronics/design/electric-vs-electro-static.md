Is electric field and electro static field the same concept?

The concepts of electric field and electrostatic field are related but not exactly the same.

### 1. Electric Field:

   - Definition: 
   
   An electric field is a region around a charged particle or object within which other charged particles or objects experience a force. It represents the influence that a charge exerts on its surroundings.
   
   - General Concept: 
   
   Electric fields can be generated by any electric charge or by changing magnetic fields (as per Maxwell's equations). Electric fields can vary with time if they are generated by changing charges or moving charges.
   
   - Example: 
   
   The electric field around a moving charge, such as an electron moving through a conductor, is a time-varying electric field.

### 2. Electrostatic Field:
   
   - Definition: 
   
   An electrostatic field is a specific type of electric field that is created by stationary or static electric charges. It’s a special case of an electric field where the charges generating the field are not moving.
   
   - Static Nature: 
   
   Since the charges are not moving, the electrostatic field is constant in time and does not change unless the distribution of charges changes.
   
   - Example: 
   
   The electric field around a charged balloon or a charged rod that is not moving is an electrostatic field.

### Key Differences:

- Time Dependence:

  - Electric Field: 
  
  Can be time-varying if the source charges are moving or if the field is generated by a changing magnetic field.
  
  - Electrostatic Field: 
  
  Is time-invariant (static) as it is created by stationary charges.

- Source:

  - Electric Field: 
  
  Can be generated by both stationary and moving charges or by changing magnetic fields.
  
  - Electrostatic Field: 
  
  Is only generated by stationary charges.

### Summary:

While both concepts describe the influence that electric charges exert on their surroundings, an electric field is the more general term that applies to both static and dynamic situations. An electrostatic field is a specific type of electric field that occurs when the charges are stationary, leading to a constant (non-changing) field.

The electric field stored in a capacitor is not fundamentally different from an electrostatic field; in fact, it is an electrostatic field. Here’s how the two concepts are related:

### 1. Electric Field in a Capacitor:

When a capacitor is charged, it creates an electric field between its plates. This field is due to the separation of positive and negative charges on the plates.

   - Nature of the Field: 
   
   Since the charges on the plates of a charged capacitor are stationary (not moving), the electric field between the plates is static. This means it is an electrostatic field.
   
   - Function: 
   
   The electric field in a capacitor stores energy, which can be released when the capacitor discharges.

### 2. Electrostatic Field:

An electrostatic field is a static (unchanging with time) electric field created by stationary charges. It describes the influence that these charges have on other charges or objects in the surrounding space.

### Relationship:

- In a Capacitor: 

The electric field present between the plates of a capacitor is specifically an electrostatic field because it results from stationary charges on the capacitor’s plates. The strength and direction of this field depend on the amount of charge stored and the distance between the plates.

- Energy Storage: 

The energy stored in a capacitor is directly related to the electrostatic field between its plates. The energy (\(E\)) stored can be calculated using the formula:

  \[
  E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2
  \]
  where \(C\) is the capacitance and \(V\) is the voltage across the plates.

### Summary:

The electric field in a capacitor is an example of an electrostatic field. Both terms refer to the same concept in this context: a static electric field created by stationary charges. Therefore, the electric field in a charged capacitor is indeed an electrostatic field.

Here's a table comparing and contrasting the electric field in a capacitor with the electrostatic field:

Distinguishing between the electric field in a capacitor and the general electrostatic field is important for several reasons, especially in the context of understanding different physical phenomena, applications, and design considerations in electronics and electromagnetism. Here’s why this distinction is useful:

### 1. Application Context:

   - Capacitor-Specific Design: 
   
   The electric field in a capacitor is a controlled, confined field used specifically for storing energy, filtering signals, or timing circuits. Engineers need to understand this field to design and optimize capacitors for specific applications.
   
   - General Electrostatics: 
   
   The electrostatic field concept applies broadly to any stationary charge configuration, from simple point charges to complex systems. This broader understanding is essential for applications like electrostatic shielding, capacitive sensing, and understanding how electric fields influence materials.

### 2. Field Behavior and Analysis:

   - Uniform vs. Non-Uniform Fields: 
   
   The electric field in a parallel-plate capacitor is  uniform between the plates, which simplifies analysis and calculations in circuit design. In contrast, general electrostatic fields can be non-uniform, requiring more complex analysis, especially in irregular charge distributions.
   
   - Boundary Conditions: 
   
   In capacitors, the field is often analyzed with specific boundary conditions (like the distance between plates and the dielectric material), which directly affect capacitance and energy storage. In broader electrostatics, boundary conditions can vary widely, affecting how fields interact with surrounding environments and materials.

### 3. Energy Storage and Circuit Behavior:

   - Energy Storage: 
   
   The electric field in a capacitor is directly related to the energy stored in the device, which is crucial for applications like power supplies, energy storage systems, and signal processing. Understanding this helps in designing circuits with specific energy requirements.
   
   - Force and Potential: 
   
   In general electrostatic fields, the focus is often on the forces between charges and the potential energy in the field. This is important in designing sensors, electrostatic precipitators, and understanding how fields interact with biological tissues or sensitive electronics.

### 4. Educational and Conceptual Clarity:

   - Simplification in Learning: 
   
   When learning about circuits, focusing on the electric field in capacitors helps simplify the concept of energy storage and circuit behavior without delving into the complexities of non-uniform fields.
   
   - Broader Understanding: 
   
   Distinguishing electrostatic fields helps students and engineers appreciate the wide range of phenomena that static fields can influence, from atomic-scale interactions to large-scale environmental effects.

### 5. Design Implications:

   - Circuit Design: 
   
   In circuit design, knowing that the electric field in a capacitor is uniform allows for precise control over the capacitance and energy storage. This is essential for designing reliable and predictable circuits.
   
   - Material Interaction: 
   
   In materials science and electrostatic applications, understanding general electrostatic fields is crucial for predicting how materials will interact with electric fields, which influences everything from insulation design to touch-sensitive devices.

### Summary:

Distinguishing between the electric field in a capacitor and the general concept of an electrostatic field is necessary to accurately design, analyze, and apply these concepts in different contexts. The specific, uniform field in a capacitor is key to circuit design and energy storage, while the broader concept of electrostatic fields is essential for understanding and managing a wide range of physical phenomena and applications.

Both electric fields and electrostatic fields can occur both inside electronic circuits and in the real world outside of circuits. However, they have different contexts of occurrence and applications. Let’s break down these ideas:

### 1. Electric Field:

   - Inside Electronic Circuits:

     - Occurrence: 
     
     Electric fields are present wherever there is a voltage difference in a circuit, such as between the plates of a capacitor, across resistors, or around charged conductors.

     - Example: 
     
     In a capacitor within a circuit, an electric field exists between the plates due to the voltage applied across them.
   - Outside of Circuits:

     - Occurrence: 
     
     Electric fields can also exist in the real world outside of circuits. For example, any charged object creates an electric field around it.
     
     - Example: The Earth has an electric field, and so does a charged balloon after being rubbed against hair.

### 2. Electrostatic Field:

   - Inside Electronic Circuits:

     - Occurrence: Electrostatic fields can exist in circuits when the charges are stationary, such as in a charged capacitor that is not connected to a circuit (isolated capacitor).

     - Example: If you disconnect a charged capacitor from a circuit and prevent it from discharging, the stationary charges on its plates create an electrostatic field between the plates.

   - Outside of Circuits:

     - Occurrence: Electrostatic fields are common in the real world outside of circuits. They occur whenever there are stationary charges in space.
     - Example: Static electricity generated by rubbing a balloon against your hair creates an electrostatic field around the balloon.

### Main Points:

- Electric Field: 

This is a more general term that applies to any region where electric forces can act on charges. It can exist in both dynamic situations (like in a circuit with moving charges) and static situations.

- Electrostatic Field: 

This is a specific type of electric field that occurs when charges are stationary. It is a static (unchanging) electric field.

### Clarification:

- Electric fields are not limited to electronic circuits; they can occur anywhere there is a charge or a changing magnetic field, whether in a circuit or in the real world.
- Electrostatic fields specifically occur in situations where the charges are stationary, and these fields can be found both inside circuits (like in a charged but isolated capacitor) and outside circuits (like around a statically charged object).

### Summary:

Both electric fields and electrostatic fields can occur inside electronic circuits and in the real world outside of circuits. The difference lies in whether the charges are stationary (electrostatic field) or potentially moving (electric field, which can include dynamic situations). Understanding this distinction helps in analyzing and applying these concepts in various physical and electronic contexts.
