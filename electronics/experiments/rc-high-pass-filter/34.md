### **Context**

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of an RC high-pass filter, a basic circuit for signal processing. A high-pass filter allows high-frequency signals to pass while attenuating low-frequency signals. By using a resistor and a capacitor in series, we explore how the circuit responds to various input frequencies and observe the relationship between input and output signals.

### **Problem Statement**

How does an RC high-pass filter attenuate low-frequency signals while allowing high-frequency signals to pass? The goal is to visualize this behavior and understand the significance of the filter's cutoff frequency (\(f_c\)).

### **Terminology**

**High-Pass Filter:**

A circuit that passes high-frequency signals and attenuates low-frequency signals below a specific cutoff frequency.

**Cutoff Frequency (\(f_c\)):**

The frequency at which the filter transitions from attenuation to passing signals, calculated as:
   \[
   f_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi R C}
   \]

**Attenuation:**

The reduction in signal amplitude, which occurs for frequencies below \(f_c\).

#### 1. **RC Filter Principles**

The RC high-pass filter uses a capacitor to block low-frequency signals and a resistor to allow high-frequency signals to pass. At low frequencies, the capacitor has a high impedance, reducing current flow. At high frequencies, the capacitor's impedance decreases, allowing signals to pass through the resistor with minimal attenuation.

#### 2. **Setup**

This experiment involves setting up a circuit with a function generator and oscilloscope to observe the input and output signals. By varying the input frequency, we visualize the filterâ€™s behavior across different frequency ranges.

#### 3. **Observations**

We analyze the attenuation of low-frequency signals and the near-identical input and output signals at high frequencies, confirming the filter's operation.

### Steps

#### Step 1: Place the Capacitor

Insert a capacitor (\(C = 0.1 \, \mu\text{F}\)) between points **g4** and **g5** on the breadboard.

#### Step 2: Add the Resistor

Connect a resistor (\(R = 10 \, \text{k}\Omega\)) to the capacitor at points **f5** and **d5**.

#### Step 3: Ground the Resistor

Connect the other end of the resistor to the negative terminal (ground) of the power rails using a black wire from **a5**.

#### Step 4: Power the Capacitor

Connect the first terminal of the capacitor to the positive terminal of the power rails using a red wire from **j4**.

#### Step 5: Configure the Function Generator

Set the function generator to:
  - **Waveform:** Sine wave
  - **Frequency:** 100 Hz
  - **Amplitude:** 5 V peak-to-peak
  - **DC Offset:** 0 V

#### Step 6: Connect the Function Generator

Attach the function generator to the breadboard:
  - Positive terminal to the capacitor's input.
  - Negative terminal to ground.

#### Step 7: Input Oscilloscope

Connect an oscilloscope to the function generator to monitor the input signal.

#### Step 8: Output Oscilloscope

Connect a second oscilloscope across the resistor to observe the output signal.

#### Step 9: Run the Simulation

Start the simulation in Tinkercad. Observe the input and output waveforms on the oscilloscopes.

### **Observations**

#### At 100 Hz (Low Frequency)

1. **Input Signal:**
   - The input oscilloscope displays a 5 V peak-to-peak sine wave.
2. **Output Signal:**
   - The output oscilloscope shows an attenuated signal (e.g., 4 V peak-to-peak).
   - This attenuation demonstrates that frequencies below \(f_c\) are partially blocked by the capacitor, which has high impedance at low frequencies.

#### At 1 kHz (High Frequency)

1. **Input Signal:**
   - The input remains a 5 V peak-to-peak sine wave.
2. **Output Signal:**
   - The output matches the input in amplitude and shape.
   - At frequencies above \(f_c\), the capacitor's impedance decreases, allowing high-frequency signals to pass with minimal attenuation.

### **Expected Behavior**

1. **Below Cutoff Frequency (\(f < f_c\)):**
   - The capacitor blocks most of the signal, resulting in low output amplitude.
2. **At Cutoff Frequency (\(f = f_c\)):**
   - The signal is attenuated by approximately 70% (\(-3 \, \text{dB}\)), marking the transition between blocking and passing.
3. **Above Cutoff Frequency (\(f > f_c\)):**
   - Signals pass through with minimal attenuation.

For \(R = 10 \, \text{k}\Omega\) and \(C = 0.1 \, \mu\text{F}\), the cutoff frequency is:
\[
f_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi R C} \approx 159 \, \text{Hz}
\]

### **Troubleshooting and Adjustments**

1. **Flat Output Signal:**
   - If the output appears as a flat line, check:
     - Frequency: Ensure the input signal frequency is above \(f_c\).
     - Connections: Verify proper series configuration of the capacitor and resistor.
     - Oscilloscope Settings: Adjust voltage and time scales to detect small signals.

2. **Signal Alignment:**
   - If the output is not attenuated as expected at low frequencies, confirm the resistor and capacitor values.

This experiment demonstrates the fundamental operation of an RC high-pass filter:

- Low-frequency signals (\(f < f_c\)) are attenuated due to the high impedance of the capacitor.
- High-frequency signals (\(f > f_c\)) pass through with minimal attenuation, as the capacitor's impedance decreases.

High-pass filters are essential in applications like audio processing, signal conditioning, and communication systems. By understanding their behavior, designers can effectively manipulate signals to meet specific requirements. This practical demonstration reinforces the importance of frequency-dependent filtering in circuit design.

### Expected Behavior

- Below 159 Hz: Output appears flat (no voltage across the resistor).
- Around 159 Hz: Output voltage starts increasing, with some attenuation and phase shift.
- Above 159 Hz: Output closely follows the input sine wave.

The difference in the scales of the input and output signals indicates that the RC high-pass filter is attenuating the input signal at 100 Hz, which is below the filter's cutoff frequency (\(f_c\)). Here's what it means:

### Observations

1. Input Signal:
   - The input oscilloscope shows a 10 V scale sine wave, which means the input signal has a peak-to-peak amplitude of 10 V.

2. Output Signal:
   - The output oscilloscope shows a 4 V scale sine wave, meaning the output signal has been attenuated to 4 V peak-to-peak.

3. Attenuation Below Cutoff Frequency:
   - At 100 Hz, which is below the cutoff frequency of \(f_c = 159 \, \text{Hz}\) (calculated earlier for \(R = 10 \, \text{k}\Omega\) and \(C = 0.1 \, \mu\text{F}\)), the high-pass filter attenuates lower frequencies. The observed reduction in output voltage aligns with this behavior.

### What This Means

- The RC high-pass filter is performing as expected:
  - Low Frequencies (\(f < f_c\)): Signals are attenuated.
  - High Frequencies (\(f > f_c\)): Signals pass with minimal attenuation.

At 100 Hz:

- The output amplitude is lower because the signal frequency is below the cutoff, where the capacitor offers higher impedance, limiting current flow through the resistor and reducing the voltage across it.

The observed output signal at 4 V peak-to-peak confirms that the filter is attenuating low-frequency components as designed. If you increase the input frequency closer to or above \(f_c = 159 \, \text{Hz}\), the output signal amplitude will increase and eventually match the input signal at higher frequencies.

At 1 kHz, the input and output waveforms being the same and on the same scale indicates that the signal frequency is well above the cutoff frequency (\(f_c = 159 \, \text{Hz}\)). The high-pass filter allows high-frequency signals to pass with minimal attenuation, showing the filter's expected behavior.
