### **Context**

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of an RC high-pass filter, a basic circuit for signal processing. A high-pass filter allows high-frequency signals to pass while attenuating low-frequency signals. We see how the circuit responds to various input frequencies and observe the relationship between input and output signals.

### **Problem Statement**

How does an RC high-pass filter attenuate low-frequency signals while allowing high-frequency signals to pass? The goal is to visualize this behavior and understand the significance of the filter's cutoff frequency (\(f_c\)).

### **Terminology**

**High-Pass Filter:**

A circuit that passes high-frequency signals and attenuates low-frequency signals below a specific cutoff frequency.

**Cutoff Frequency (\(f_c\)):**

The frequency at which the filter transitions from attenuation to passing signals, calculated as:
   \[
   f_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi R C}
   \]

**Attenuation:**

The reduction in signal amplitude, which occurs for frequencies below \(f_c\).

1. AC Voltage Source: Set to generate various frequencies (e.g., a sine wave).
2. Resistor: 10 kΩ.
3. Capacitor: 0.1 µF.
4. Oscilloscope: To observe the input and output waveforms.

Steps

Step 1

Take a breadoard. Connect a 0.1 micro Farad capacitor to g4 and g5 in the breadboard.

Step 2

Connect a 10 k ohm resistor to the capacitor. Resistor is connected to f5 and d5 in the breadboard. The capacitor is now in series with the resistor.

Step 3

Connect the other end of the resitor to the negative terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. This is the black line from a5 to the ground.

Step 4

Connect the first terminal of the capacitor to the postive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard. This is the red line from j4 to the positive terminal.

Step 5

Take a function generator. Set the frequency to 100 hz, amplitude to 5 volts, function to Sine and DC offset to 0.

Step 8

Take another oscilloscope for observing the output.

Step 9

Connect the ouput oscilloscope across the resistor. This is the output of the circuit. This setup allows you to observe how the input and output signals compare at different frequencies.

Step 10

Run the simulation. You can view the input and output in the oscilloscope. The AC source is set to a low frequency of 100 Hz, to observe how the circuit behaves at lower frequencies.

Image 5

The scale of the input is 10 volts, the output is 4 volts. This demonstrates attenuation of the input signal at low frequency. At low frequencies, the output signal is weaker than the input signal. This is because the capacitor’s impedance is high at low frequencies, blocking them from passing through to the resistor.

Step 11

Increase the function generator frequency to 1 k Hz. You can see the input and ouput are similar in shape and magnitude. As the frequency increases, the output signal amplitude increases. This is because the capacitor’s impedance decreases at higher frequencies, allowing more of the input signal to pass through to the output.

Both oscilloscope are at 10 volt scale.
