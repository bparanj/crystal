Review and edit:

In electronics, start by connecting the negative terminal first for safety. This minimizes short circuit risk and establishes a stable ground reference. Keep the circuit open (unconnected positive terminal) until all components are securely connected to prevent damage.

Safety and Practical Considerations

Minimize Short Circuits: Connect the negative terminal first to keep the circuit at ground potential and avoid accidental shorts.

Stable Reference: Establishing a ground reference first reduces voltage spikes or incorrect wiring.

Avoid Surges: Keeping the positive terminal disconnected while wiring prevents unexpected surges and component damage.

Organized Assembly and Easier Debugging: Connecting the negative terminal first helps verify connections before applying power, making assembly safer and troubleshooting easier.

Common Practice for Breadboards

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative rail first, then connect the positive terminal last. This approach minimizes shorts, avoids surges, and allows for final checks before powering up. If issues arise, you can easily disconnect the positive terminal for safe troubleshooting.
