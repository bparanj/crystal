Diode is a polarized electronic component. It controls the direction of current flow in a circuit. By observing the diode's response in forward and reverse bias configurations, we see how it allows or blocks current flow.

### **Problem Statement**

Why do we need electronic components that enforce polarity, such as diodes? How does controlling the direction of current flow benefit a circuit? The goal is to understand the diode’s ability to permit current in one direction (forward bias) while blocking it in the opposite direction (reverse bias).

### **Terminology**

**Diode:** 

A polarized component that allows current to flow in one direction (from anode to cathode) and blocks it in the reverse direction.

**Forward Bias:** 

When the positive terminal of the power supply is connected to the anode of the diode, allowing current to flow.

**Reverse Bias:** 

When the positive terminal of the power supply is connected to the cathode, blocking current flow.

**Reverse-Bias Blocking:** 

The diode’s property of preventing current flow in the reverse direction.

Step 10

Run the simulation. The red LED turns on. This indicates forward current flow.

Image 12

When the LED turns on in this circuit, it is an example of forward bias. In forward bias, the positive side of the power supply is connected to the anode of the LED, and the negative side is connected to the cathode. This allows current to flow through the LED, causing it to emit light. The resistor is there to limit the current and protect the LED from excessive current flow.

Step 11

Reverse the direction of the diode. Run the simulation.

The red LED will be off. This demonstrates how the diode only allows current to flow in one direction. The technical term for this is called reverse-bias blocking.

This experiment demonstrates the basic function of a diode in controlling the direction of current flow in a circuit. A diode only allows current to flow in one direction, from the anode to the cathode. When connected correctly, current can pass through and light up the LED. Reversing the diode blocks the current, preventing the LED from turning on. LED visually shows how the polarity of the diode influences the flow of current in the circuit.
