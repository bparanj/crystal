### **Context**

This experiment demonstrates the fundamental behavior of a diode, a polarized electronic component that controls the direction of current flow in a circuit. By observing the diode's response in forward and reverse bias configurations, we explore its role in allowing or blocking current flow.

### **Problem Statement**

Why do we need electronic components that enforce polarity, such as diodes? How does controlling the direction of current flow benefit a circuit? The goal is to understand the diode’s ability to permit current in one direction (forward bias) while blocking it in the opposite direction (reverse bias).

When the LED turns on in this circuit, it is an example of forward bias. In forward bias, the positive side of the power supply is connected to the anode of the LED, and the negative side is connected to the cathode. This allows current to flow through the LED, causing it to emit light. The resistor is there to limit the current and protect the LED from excessive current flow.

The red LED will be off. This demonstrates how the diode only allows current to flow in one direction. The technical term for this is called reverse-bias blocking.

This experiment demonstrates the basic function of a diode in controlling the direction of current flow in a circuit. A diode only allows current to flow in one direction, from the anode to the cathode. When connected correctly, current can pass through and light up the LED. Reversing the diode blocks the current, preventing the LED from turning on. LED visually shows how the polarity of the diode influences the flow of current in the circuit.
