### Context and Problem

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of an inductor in a DC circuit. Its ability to store energy in a magnetic field and release it when the circuit's state changes. It shows how inductors respond to switching events and demonstrates the resulting effects on polarized components like LEDs. This is applied in transient protection mechanisms.

### Terminology

A passive component that stores energy in a magnetic field when current flows through it.

**Back EMF:**

The voltage generated by an inductor as it resists changes in current, particularly when the circuit is interrupted.

**LED (Light Emitting Diode):**

A polarized component that emits light when current flows in the forward direction.

**Slide Switch:**

A switch that allows the circuit to toggle between connected and disconnected states.

### Setup

#### Components

- 9V battery
- 50 Ω resistor
- 1 H inductor
- Slide switch
- Red LED
- Blue LED

### Steps

#### **Step 1:

1. **Add the Slide Switch:**
   - Place the slide switch between g4, g5, and g6.

#### **Step 2: Run the Simulation**

2. **Connect the Resistor:**
   - Attach a 50 Ω resistor to the common terminal of the switch at j5 and j9.
   - Connect the resistor to the positive power rail using a red wire from j4.

3. **Add the Inductor:**
   - Place the 1 H inductor between i12 and i26.
   - Connect the resistor to the inductor using a green wire from h9 to h12.

4. **Add the LEDs:**
   - Connect the **red LED** between b9 (anode) and b10 (cathode).
   - Connect the **blue LED** between d4 (cathode) and d5 (anode).

5. 
   - Connect the cathode of the red LED to the negative power rail using a black wire from a10.
   - Connect the anode of the blue LED to the resistor using a green wire from e9 to f9.
   - Connect the cathode of the blue LED to the negative power rail using a black wire from a5.
   - Connect the inductor’s free terminal to the negative power rail using a black wire from f16.

6. **Power the Circuit:**
   - Attach a 9V battery to the breadboard, connecting its positive and negative terminals to the respective power rails.


   - Close the switch to connect the circuit to the power supply.
   The blue LED lights up, indicating normal current flow through the resistor and inductor.

   - Open the switch to disconnect the circuit from the power supply.
   The red LED lights up momentarily as the inductor releases its stored energy.

3. **Repeat the Cycle:**
   - Toggle the switch to observe how the LEDs alternate between lighting up, depending on the circuit's state.

#### Behavior of the Inductor

1. **Energy Storage:**
   - When the circuit is closed, current flows through the inductor, creating a magnetic field. This process stores energy in the inductor.

2. **Energy Release (Back EMF):**
   - When the circuit is opened, the inductor resists the sudden drop in current by releasing its stored energy.
   - This back EMF generates a current that flows in the opposite direction, lighting up the red LED.

#### Behavior of LEDs

This experiment demonstrates several fundamental principles of inductors and their role in switching circuits:
1. **Blue LED:**
   - Lights up when the switch is closed, as the current flows in the forward direction through the LED.

2. **Red LED:**
   - Lights up when the switch is opened, as the inductor’s back EMF reverses the current direction.

This experiment demonstrates several basic principles of inductors and their role in switching circuits:

   - Inductors store energy in a magnetic field and release it as back EMF when the circuit state changes.

   - Inductors resist sudden changes in current, which is critical in circuits with switches, relays, and transient protection.

4. **Applications:**
   - Inductor behavior is used in circuits that involve switching, transient suppression, and energy transfer.
   - LEDs light up only when current flows in the forward direction, illustrating the effect of current reversal caused by the inductor.

By understanding these behaviors, engineers can effectively utilize inductors and other components to manage energy and current flow in electronic systems.

Summarize:

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of an inductive energy storage circuit. It shows the role of inductors in storing and releasing energy when the circuit switches states.

   - The slide switch controls whether the circuit is connected to the power supply or disconnected.
   - Turning the switch on powers the circuit, lighting the blue LED.
   - Turning the switch off causes the red LED to light, as energy stored in the inductor is released.

   - The inductor stores energy in its magnetic field when current flows through it.
   - When the circuit is disconnected (switch off), the inductor resists the sudden drop in current by releasing its stored energy.
   - This released energy powers the red LED momentarily after the switch is turned off.

   - The blue LED lights up during normal current flow when the switch is on.
   - The red LED lights up when the inductor discharges, as the polarity of the current reverses.

   - LEDs are polarized components that light up only when current flows in the forward direction.
   - This circuit demonstrates how current changes direction in response to the inductor's behavior during switching.

- Energy Storage: Demonstrates how inductors store and release energy in circuits.
- Switching Circuits: Useful for understanding how inductors behave in switches, relays, and transient protection.
- LED Polarity: Highlights the importance of correct orientation and current flow in LEDs.
