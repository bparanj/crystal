Image 6

Step 5

The Cathode of the LED is connected to the negative terminal of the breadboard. This is the black wire that connects f15 to the negative terminal of the battery.

Step 6

Take a 9 volt battery.

Image 8

Step 7

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Image 9

Step 8

Connect the postive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Image 10

Step 9

Image 11

Step 10

Run the simulation. The LED will turn on.

Image 12

Step 11

Take a multimeter. It should be in Volt setting.

Image 13

Step 12

Connect the negative terminal of the multimeter to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Image 14

Step 13

Connect the positiver terminal of the multimeter to the positive terminal of the breadboard.

Image 15

Step 14

Run the simulation. The LED turns on. The voltage reading shows 9 volt is supplied to the entire circuit. Stop the simulation.

Image 16

Step 15

Connect the negative terminal of the multimeter to the first terminal of the first resistor. Connect the positive terminal of the multimeter to the second terminal of the first resistor. Since resistor does not have polarity. The resistor value reading will be the same. Resistor values are read when there is no current in the circuit.

Image 17

Step 16

The reading shows negative 2.37 volts. We stick to positive voltages in DC circuit.

Image 18

Step 17

Let us switch the terminals of the multimeter across the first resistor.

Image 19.

Step 18

Run the simulation. The LED is on and we see the postive 2.37 volts across the first resistor.

Image 20

Step 19

Connect the multimeter to the second resistor.

Image 21

Step 20

Run the simulation. You can see the voltage reads: 4.75 volts.

Image 22

Step 21

Connect the multimeter across the LED. Positive terminal of the multimeter is connected to the Anode of the LED.

Image 23

The negative terminal is connected to the Cathode of the LED.

Image 24

Step 22

Run the simulation. The multimeter shows the voltage drop across the LED is 1.87 volts.

Image 25

Step 23

Lets add the readings:

2.37 + 4.75 + 1.87 = 8.99 volts

You can see the measurement is not 100% accurate. It is almost equal to the voltage supplied by the battery, which is 9 volts.

Step 24

Stop the simulation.

Image 26

Step 25

Change the multimeter reading to ohms.

Image 27

Step 26

Connect the terminals of the multimeter to the first resistor to measure the resistance.

Image 28

Step 27

Run the simulation. The first resistor value is 1 k ohm.

Image 29

Step 28

Connect the terminals of the multimeter to the second resistor to measure the resistance.

Image 30

Step 29

Run the simulation. The second resistor value is 2 k ohm.

Image 31

Step 30

Connect the terminals of the multimeter to the LED.

Image 32

Step 31

Run the simulation. The resistance of LED is negligible. So it does not show any reading.

Image 33

Step 32

Make the first resistor value as 2 ohm resistor.

Image 34

Step 33

The voltage drop across the LED is 1.95 volts.

Image 35

Step 34

The voltage drop across the second resistor is 14 m volts.

Image 36

Step 35

The voltage drop across the first resistor is 7.02 volts.

Image 38

If we add these three values: 1.95 + 7.02 + 0.014 =  8.984 volts. This is approximately equal to the power source value of 9 volts.

### Context and Problem  

Understanding how voltage is distributed across components in a series circuit is a foundational principle in electronics. The voltage divider circuit, which leverages this behavior, is a simple yet powerful tool that finds applications in countless electronic systems. This experiment demonstrates how resistors divide voltage and how the concept of voltage drops manifests in practical circuits.

---

### Key Definitions  

- **Voltage Divider Circuit:** A circuit that uses resistors in series to divide an input voltage into smaller output voltages based on resistance values.  
- **Voltage Drop:** The decrease in electrical potential across a component due to resistance, governed by Ohm’s Law (\( V = IR \)).  
- **Forward Voltage Drop (LED):** The fixed voltage required for an LED to conduct current and emit light.  

---

### Voltage Divider Circuit: Structure and Behavior  

**Structure:**  
The circuit consists of two resistors connected in series across a voltage source (e.g., a 9V battery). The resistors create a division of the total voltage, with each resistor receiving a share proportional to its resistance. The voltage at the midpoint between the two resistors, relative to the ground, is the circuit's output voltage.

**Behavior:**  
- When current flows through the resistors, each experiences a voltage drop proportional to its resistance value.  
- The total voltage drop across all components equals the supply voltage, illustrating Kirchhoff's Voltage Law.  
- The midpoint voltage (output voltage) can be calculated using the formula:  
  \[
  V_{\text{out}} = V_{\text{in}} \left( \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \right)
  \]

### Experiment and Observations  

**Setup:**  
1. Connect a 1 kΩ resistor in series with a 3 kΩ resistor.  
2. Use a 9V battery as the power source.  
3. Place a multimeter across each resistor to measure the voltage drop.  
4. Optional: Add LEDs across each resistor to visualize voltage differences.  

**Observations:**  
- The larger resistor (3 kΩ) experiences a higher voltage drop than the smaller resistor (1 kΩ).  
- Voltage divides proportionally:  
  - \( V_{1k} \approx 2.25V \)  
  - \( V_{3k} \approx 6.75V \)  

**Key Insight:**  
This proportional division demonstrates how the resistor values dictate the voltage drop, validating the voltage divider formula.

---

### Impact of Changing Resistor Values  

Altering the resistor values changes the distribution of voltage:  
- **Higher Resistance:** Increases the voltage drop across that resistor.  
- **Lower Resistance:** Reduces the voltage drop.  

This highlights the importance of selecting appropriate resistor values when designing circuits to achieve specific output voltages.

---

### Forward Voltage Drop in LEDs  

Adding LEDs to the circuit introduces another layer of understanding. LEDs require a specific forward voltage (e.g., 1.87V in this case) to conduct. This behavior demonstrates that components in a circuit impose distinct voltage requirements, further reinforcing the concept of voltage drops.

---

### Applications of Voltage Divider Circuits  

Voltage dividers serve numerous practical purposes, such as:  
1. **Reducing Voltage:** Adjusting voltage levels for sensors and low-voltage components.  
2. **Reference Voltages:** Providing stable voltage points in circuits.  
3. **Level Shifting:** Adapting signal levels for compatibility between components.  
4. **Biasing Circuits:** Setting operating points in amplifiers and other active components.

---

### Demonstrated Principles  

This experiment illustrates:  
1. **Voltage Division:** Voltage is distributed in proportion to resistance in a series circuit.  
2. **Voltage Drops:** The sum of individual voltage drops equals the total supply voltage.  
3. **Design Flexibility:** By changing resistor values, designers can control output voltage to meet specific needs.

The voltage divider, though simple, underpins many advanced electronic systems. Understanding its behavior equips engineers with a fundamental tool for managing voltage in circuits.
