#### 1. **Current Control and Polarity**

The LED, like many electronic components, operates within specific limits for voltage and current. Exceeding these limits can cause irreversible damage. A resistor is introduced into the circuit to control the current. Furthermore, LEDs are polarized; they only conduct electricity in one direction, emphasizing the need for correct orientation.

To demonstrate these principles, we construct a basic circuit with a 9V battery as the power source, an LED, and a 1 kΩ resistor. This configuration ensures the LED operates safely while visibly indicating current flow.

- **Step 1-7:** Establish the initial circuit setup, connecting the LED directly to the power source. This recreates conditions from the previous experiment where the LED was damaged due to excessive current.
- **Step 8-10:** Modify the circuit by introducing the resistor. The resistor is connected in series with the LED, limiting the current and preventing damage.
- **Step 12:** Demonstrate polarity by reversing the LED’s orientation. This reveals its behavior as a diode, allowing current flow in only one direction.

#### Current Control Example

In the previous experiment, the LED connected directly to the battery drew excessive current (915 mA), well above its safe limit of 20 mA, leading to damage. Adding a 1 kΩ resistor reduces the current to a safe level of approximately 9 mA (calculated using Ohm's law: \(I = \frac{V}{R}\)).

#### Polarity Example
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

When the LED's anode is connected to the positive terminal and its cathode to the negative terminal, the LED lights up, confirming proper current flow. Reversing this connection prevents the LED from emitting light, as it blocks current in reverse bias.

LED Circuit (Resistor + LED)

Demonstrate how controlling the current through an electronic component can protect it from damage.

We will begin with the same circuit used for the LED damage demo and modify it. The circuit diagram is shown in the diagram.

The circuit uses one 9 volt battery, demonstrating how to control voltage and current for safe LED operation.

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Image 3

Step 2

Take a 9 volt battery. This will give a power source with 9 volts.

Image 4

Step 3

Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Image 5

Step 4

Connect the negative terminal of the power rails of the breadboard to section B of the breadboard.

Image 6

We keep an open circuit when we lay the components for safety.

Step 5

Connect the LED to the section B of the breadboard. The Cathode of the LED is connected to the negative terminal.

Image 7

Step 6

Connect the Anode of the LED to the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Image 8

Step 7

Connect the the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the breadboard. Now the entire circuit is complete. This is the same circuit as the previous experiment.

Step 8

We can now modify the previous experiment. Instead of connecting the LED directly to the negative terminal, we will use the resistor. Remove the direct connection from LED to the negative terminal of the breadboard.

Step 11

Run the simulation. The RED led is in the on state.

Image 14

Step 12

If we reverse the direction of LED by connecting Anode of the LED to the resistor and Cathode of the LED to the positive terminal of the power supply, the LED will not turn on. This demonstrates that LED which is a type of diode only allows current to flow through in one direction. The polarity matters.

Revise and condense:

Using a resistor (1 kΩ) limits the current through the LED, protecting it from damage due to excessive current. The LED used in this experiment can only handle current upto 20 mA. You can see the maximum rating for the LED in the datasheet.

LEDs have polarity. They only allow current to flow in one direction. Reversing the LED's connections by connecting the anode to the resistor and cathode to the positive terminal will not turn on the LED. Correct polarity is required for proper functioning of the LED. The longer leg (Anode) is connected to positive, the shorter leg (Cathode) to negative.

LEDs provide visual feedback of flow of current through the circuit. LED confirms correct connections by turning on and not getting damaged like the previous experiment when the current was 915 mA.
