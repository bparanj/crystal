Step 4

Take a multimeter. Change the setting to measure current. You can see A is selected. Run the simulation. Measure the current between the positive and negative terminals of the breadboard. You can see it is 6 amperes.

The current shown (6 amperes) is determined by the internal resistance of the multimeter when it's set to measure current and connected directly across the battery terminals.

In current measurement mode, multimeters are designed to have very low internal resistance to allow the current to flow through them as if they were just a wire. This enables the meter to measure the current in a circuit accurately without introducing much resistance.

However, if you connect the multimeter directly across the battery without any load, the low internal resistance creates a near-short circuit condition.

A real battery has a small internal resistance, typically very low for a 9V battery. The current flowing directly across the battery terminals depends on this internal resistance and the low resistance path of the multimeter.

Since this setup essentially shorts the battery, the internal resistance of the battery and the low resistance of the multimeter together limit the current you see (in this case, 6 amperes).

Connecting a multimeter directly across a battery in current mode is generally not recommended. It can damage the multimeter, overheat the battery, or even cause harm, as most multimeters aren’t designed to handle high currents for prolonged periods.

The 6-ampere reading is due to the very low internal resistance of the multimeter in current mode, combined with the battery's internal resistance. This setup effectively creates a short circuit, allowing a large current to flow briefly.

Step 5

Stop the simulation.

Step 6

Connect the positive lead of the multimeter to the end of the second resistor.

Remove the wire that connects the end of the second resistor to the ground. Now the multimeter is in series with the resistor. To read the current value, multimeter must be connected in series to check the value flowing through the second resistor.

Step 7

Run the simulation. The current through the second resistor is 4.49 mA. This resistor has 2 k ohm value.

Step 8

Connect the second resistor back to the ground. Connect the positive lead of the multimeter to the end of the first resistor.

Image 7

Remove the wire that connects the first resistor to the ground. Now the multimeter is in series with the first resistor.

Step 9

Image 8

Run the simulation. You can see the current through the first resistor is 8.98 m A. It is higher than the second resistor because the value of first resistor is lower than the second resistor.

Step 10

Change the value of the second resistor to 1 k ohm. Now both are 1 k ohm resistors. Connect the multimeter to the second resistor.

Step 11

Run the simulation. The current through the second resistor is 8.97 mA.

Step 12

Connect the multimeter to the first resistor.

Step 13

Run the simulation. The current through the first resistor is also 8.97 mA.

### Context and Problem  

A current divider circuit is a fundamental configuration in electronics where an input current splits among parallel branches. The division is governed by the resistances in these branches, with smaller resistances drawing more current and larger resistances drawing less. This principle is essential for designing circuits that distribute current efficiently and safely.

However, improper measurement techniques can lead to misleading results or even damage the equipment and components. This scenario illustrates the risks and concepts associated with measuring current in a circuit, particularly when using a multimeter in current mode.

### Key Definitions  

- **Current Divider Circuit:** A circuit configuration where input current splits into parallel branches, with the current in each branch inversely proportional to its resistance.  
- **Internal Resistance:** The resistance within a power source, such as a battery, that opposes current flow.  
- **Multimeter (Current Mode):** A tool designed to measure current, typically with very low internal resistance to ensure accurate readings without adding significant impedance to the circuit.

---

### Experiment Setup  

#### Circuit Design  
1. Two parallel resistors (R₁ and R₂) are connected to a 9V battery:  
   - Scenario 1: \( R₁ = 1k\Omega \), \( R₂ = 2k\Omega \)  
   - Scenario 2: \( R₁ = 1k\Omega \), \( R₂ = 2\Omega \)  

2. The current through the circuit is measured using a multimeter.

#### Observations  
When the multimeter is connected directly across the battery terminals in current mode, it shows a current of 6 amperes. This reading is not reflective of the designed current divider circuit but rather a result of the interaction between the battery and the multimeter.

---

### Analysis  

#### Multimeter in Current Mode  
Multimeters in current mode have very low internal resistance to allow the full current to flow through them as if they were a wire. This is necessary for accurate current measurement but introduces a significant risk when the multimeter is connected directly across a power source:  

- **Near-Short Circuit Condition:** The multimeter’s low resistance creates a direct path for current, effectively bypassing the designed circuit.  
- **Battery’s Internal Resistance:** A real battery has a small internal resistance, typically much lower than the circuit's resistors. In this setup, the battery's internal resistance and the multimeter's resistance form the only opposition to current flow.

#### Resulting Current Flow  
The observed 6-ampere current results from:  
1. The low resistance of the multimeter in current mode.  
2. The internal resistance of the battery limiting the maximum current.  

This creates a high-current condition, which is effectively a short circuit. While the battery prevents infinite current due to its internal resistance, the current is still dangerously high.

---

### Risks and Recommendations  

#### Risks of Direct Multimeter Connection  
- **Damage to the Multimeter:** Multimeters are not designed to handle such high currents for extended periods, leading to potential overheating or failure.  
- **Battery Overheating:** The high current can cause the battery to overheat, risking damage or even leakage.  
- **Circuit Misinterpretation:** The reading does not represent the intended circuit behavior, leading to erroneous conclusions.

#### Proper Measurement Practices  
1. **Always Use a Load:** Ensure the multimeter is part of a complete circuit, with resistive or other load components connected.  
2. **Check Multimeter Specifications:** Verify that the multimeter can handle the expected current levels in your circuit.  
3. **Avoid Short Circuits:** Never connect a multimeter directly across a power source in current mode without a resistive load.

### Insight  

This scenario highlights the importance of understanding both the tools and the components in an electronic circuit. While a multimeter is a powerful diagnostic tool, improper use can compromise both the measurement and the circuit. The observed current of 6 amperes is not a property of the current divider circuit but a consequence of bypassing it through the multimeter, emphasizing the need for careful setup and measurement techniques.

By respecting these principles, you can safely and accurately explore the behavior of current divider circuits, observing how current distributes according to resistance and how real-world factors like internal resistance shape circuit behavior.
