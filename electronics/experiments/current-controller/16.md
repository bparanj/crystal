Current Controller

This experiment demonstrates that the current before and after a resistor is the same.

Water analogy for resistor gives the wrong impression that the valve is equivalent to resistor. Amount of water before the valve is not the same as after the value. The valve does not behave the same way a resistor. They are not equivalent. Because resistors are designed to dissipate heat energy to reduce the electrical energy. You cannot destroy any form of energy. If you have to reduce the electrical energy, some of the electrical energy must be transformed to some other form of energy. In this case, it is heat energy. This is considered as a waste because the heat energy is not used to perform any useful work.

Review and condense

Using a resistor to limit current in the circuit prevents excessive current that could damage the LED.

By placing the multimeter in series with the LED and resistor, it allows current measurement through the LED. The experiment shows that moving components or the measurement point in a series circuit does not change the current value, reinforcing the concept of uniform current in a series circuit.

### Context and Problem

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of current in a series circuit, specifically the role of a resistor in limiting current and the principle of uniform current flow. A common misconception is that resistors behave like valves in a water analogy, controlling flow in a manner similar to mechanical restriction. This analogy fails to capture the essence of a resistor’s function: transforming electrical energy into heat. Understanding this transformation clarifies why current remains the same before and after a resistor in a series circuit.

### Terminology

**Resistor:** 

A component designed to oppose the flow of electrical current, transforming electrical energy into heat energy.

**Current in Series Circuits:** 

The current flowing through all components in a series circuit remains the same, governed by the continuity of charge flow.

**Heat Dissipation:** 

Resistors dissipate energy as heat, which is often considered wasted unless used for thermal purposes.

### Setup

#### Components

- 9V battery
- LED
- 1kΩ resistor
- Multimeter

### Steps

#### **Step 1: **

1. **:** Connect the negative terminal of the 9V battery to the breadboard’s negative power rail.
2. **Place the LED:** Insert the LED into points g11 and g12, ensuring proper orientation (anode and cathode).
3. **Add the Resistor:** Place the 1kΩ resistor between f11 and d11.
4. **Complete the Power Connections:**
   - Connect the anode of the LED to the positive power rail using a wire.
   - Connect the battery’s positive terminal to the positive power rail.

#### **Step 2: Measure Current in the Circuit**

1. **Set the Multimeter to Current Mode:** Adjust the multimeter to measure current (amperes).
2. **Insert the Multimeter in Series:**
   - Connect the multimeter’s positive terminal to c11 on the breadboard.
   - Connect the multimeter’s negative terminal to the negative power rail.
3. **Run the Simulation:** The LED turns on, and the multimeter displays a current of **7.04 mA**.

#### **Step 3: Reconfigure the Measurement Point**

1. **Move the Multimeter:**
   - Relocate the resistor to b11 and the negative power rail.
   - Place the multimeter between f11 and e11, ensuring it measures current before the resistor.
2. **Run the Simulation Again:** The LED remains lit, and the current reading on the multimeter remains unchanged at **7.04 mA**.

#### Uniform Current in Series Circuits

The experiment demonstrates that current in a series circuit remains uniform, regardless of the measurement point. This continuity results from the conservation of charge: all charges passing through one component must pass through the others in the series.

#### Misconceptions About Resistors

The water analogy often suggests that resistors act like valves, reducing the flow before and after them. This is incorrect because:
- A resistor does not block or divert current; instead, it transforms electrical energy into heat.

#### Misconceptions About Resistors

The water analogy often suggests that resistors act like valves, reducing the flow before and after them. This is incorrect because:

- A resistor does not block or divert current; instead, it transforms electrical energy into heat.
- The resistor’s role is to control the **rate** of energy transfer, limiting the current to prevent damage to sensitive components, such as LEDs.

Placing a resistor in series with the LED ensures the current stays within safe limits. This protects the LED from excessive current, which could cause overheating or permanent damage.

This experiment reinforces two fundamental principles of electronics:

1. **Uniform Current in Series Circuits:** Current remains consistent throughout all components in a series circuit, regardless of their individual characteristics.
