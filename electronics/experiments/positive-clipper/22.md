In this experiment, we have a positive clipping circuit using a diode and a resistor to clip the positive part of an AC waveform.

- The diode is oriented with its anode connected to the resistor and its cathode connected to the negative rail (ground).
- When the input sine wave goes positive (above 0V), the diode becomes forward-biased if the input voltage exceeds the diode's forward voltage (typically around 0.7V for a silicon diode).
- As a result, the positive part of the input waveform above 0.7V is "clipped" or removed, because the diode conducts and directs this excess voltage to ground, preventing it from reaching the output.

- When observing the output on the oscilloscope, you’ll see that the positive portion of the sine wave above approximately 0.7V is removed, or clipped, resulting in a flat line at 0.7V during these peaks.
- The negative portion of the sine wave, however, is unaffected because the diode is reverse-biased during this half-cycle and does not conduct.

- When you run the simulation, you’ll observe the input waveform on one oscilloscope as a full sine wave.
- On the output oscilloscope, you’ll see a clipped sine wave with the positive peaks limited to around 0.7V or less, depending on the diode's characteristics.

This circuit is a positive clipper because it clips or removes the positive portion of the input signal above a specific threshold (the diode's forward voltage), demonstrating the basic function of diode-based clipping in signal processing.

### Context and Problem  

The positive clipper circuit demonstrates how a diode can be used to modify an AC waveform by removing or limiting its positive portion. This principle is widely used in signal processing to protect components from overvoltage or to reshape signals for specific applications. By understanding the diode's behavior in forward and reverse bias, we can design circuits to clip or limit portions of an input signal effectively.

### Terminology  

**Positive Clipper:** 

A circuit that removes or limits the positive portion of an AC signal beyond a certain threshold.  

**Forward Bias:** 

When the diode allows current to flow, typically occurring when the voltage exceeds the diode's forward voltage (approximately 0.7V for silicon diodes).  

**Reverse Bias:** 

When the diode blocks current, occurring during the negative half of the AC cycle.  

### Setup  

#### Components  

- Function generator (1 kHz sine wave, 5V amplitude)  
- 100 kΩ resistor  
- Diode  
- Oscilloscope  

### Steps  

#### **Step 1: **  

1. **Place the Resistor:**  
   - Insert the 100 kΩ resistor between h4 and h8 on the breadboard.  

2. **Add the Diode:**  
   - Connect the **anode** of the diode to the resistor at f8.  
   - Connect the **cathode** of the diode to the negative power rail at d8.  

3. **Complete the Connections:**  
   - Connect the positive terminal of the power rail (j4) to the resistor using a red wire.  
   - Connect the negative terminal of the power rail to the cathode of the diode.  

#### **Step 2: Input Signal Configuration**  

1. **Set Up the Function Generator:**  
   - Configure the function generator to output a sine wave with a frequency of 1 kHz and a peak amplitude of 5V.  
   - Connect its positive and negative terminals to the corresponding power rails.  

2. **Verify the Input Signal:**  
   - Attach an oscilloscope to monitor the input signal:  
     - Connect the oscilloscope's positive terminal to the function generator's positive terminal.  
     - Connect the oscilloscope's negative terminal to the function generator's negative terminal.  
   - Run the simulation and observe a full sine wave oscillating between +5V and -5V.  

#### **Step 3: Monitor the Output Signal**  

1. **Connect the Output Oscilloscope:**  
   - Attach the oscilloscope's positive terminal to the **anode** of the diode at g8.  
   - Attach the oscilloscope's negative terminal to the **cathode** of the diode at c8.  

2. **Run the Simulation:**  
   - Observe the output waveform.  

### Observations  

**Input Signal:**  

   - The input signal is a sine wave oscillating between +5V and -5V.  

**Output Signal:**  

   - The positive portion of the waveform above the diode’s forward voltage (approximately +0.7V) is clipped.  
   - The negative portion of the waveform remains unchanged.  

#### Circuit Behavior  

**Clipping the Positive Portion:**  

   - During the positive half-cycle of the input signal, the diode becomes forward-biased when the input voltage exceeds 0.7V.  
   - In this state, the diode conducts, directing the excess voltage above 0.7V to the ground.  

**Unchanged Negative Portion:**  

   - During the negative half-cycle, the diode is reverse-biased and does not conduct.  
   - As a result, the negative portion of the input signal passes through the circuit unaltered.  

#### Observed Output  

On the oscilloscope, the positive peaks of the sine wave are flattened at approximately +0.7V, while the negative half of the sine wave remains intact.  

The positive clipper circuit illustrates the diode’s ability to selectively clip one portion of an AC waveform. Main ideas include:  

1. **Positive Clipping:** 

The diode conducts during the positive half-cycle, removing voltage above its forward threshold (e.g., +0.7V).  

2. **Signal Shaping:** 

The circuit modifies the waveform without affecting its negative half, demonstrating selective clipping.  

3. **Applications:** 

Positive clippers are commonly used for signal shaping, overvoltage protection, and waveform modification in electronics.

By understanding and observing this behavior, engineers can design circuits to protect components or prepare signals for further processing. The positive clipper serves as a foundational example of diode-based signal manipulation.
