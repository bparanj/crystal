Step 21

If you increase the frequency to 7.33 kHz. Because the scale of the oscilloscope is small, you see a thick line in the input. The output across the capacitor has shifted below the horizontal line and is in milli volts.

Step 22

Change the input frequency to 1 MHz. This is the highest so far. You can now see the output voltage across the capacitor has decreased to micro volts.

This experiment demonstrates an RC low-pass filter using a resistor and capacitor, focusing on how the capacitor's behavior changes with different input frequencies from a function generator set to a square wave.

At low frequencies (e.g., 1 Hz), the capacitor allows the signal to pass through with minimal blocking. In this range, the capacitor has time to charge and discharge with each cycle of the square wave.

The output waveform closely resembles the input square wave, but the edges appear slightly rounded, showing how the capacitor smooths rapid transitions.

As the frequency increases (e.g., 100 Hz to 1.42 kHz), the capacitor starts to resist the signal more effectively. This occurs because the capacitive reactance (\(X_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}\)) decreases with increasing frequency, causing the capacitor to act more like a short circuit for high frequencies.

At 1.42 kHz, the output voltage across the capacitor is minimal (in millivolts), indicating that the capacitor is blocking the high-frequency components of the input signal.

At very high frequencies (e.g., 7.33 kHz and above), the output voltage across the capacitor becomes negligible, measured in microvolts at 1 MHz. This shows that the capacitor effectively blocks the high-frequency components, preventing them from reaching the output.

The capacitor now appears almost like an open circuit, as it charges and discharges so quickly that it cannot pass significant current through.

When the input frequency is increased to an intermediate range (e.g., around 100 Hz), the square waveform starts transforming into a sawtooth waveform at the output. This shape change results from the capacitor’s charging and discharging patterns, which smooth out the rapid transitions in the square wave.

This effect illustrates the capacitor’s role in filtering out high-frequency components, effectively smoothing the waveform.

The RC circuit acts as a low-pass filter, allowing low-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating or blocking high-frequency signals. The point at which the filter significantly attenuates the signal is the cutoff frequency, determined by the values of the resistor and capacitor.

This experiment demonstrates that:

- Low frequencies pass through the filter with minimal blocking.
- Higher frequencies are increasingly attenuated, showing the filter's ability to block high-frequency components.
- At very high frequencies, the capacitor blocks nearly all signal, allowing only a small residual voltage through.

This demonstrates the basic behavior of an RC low-pass filter and shows how capacitors can be used in circuits to allow only certain frequencies to pass.

### Context and Problem  

The RC low-pass filter is a fundamental circuit in electronics used to attenuate high-frequency signals while allowing low-frequency signals to pass through. This behavior relies on the frequency-dependent reactance of the capacitor. By varying the input frequency, we can observe how the circuit selectively filters components of the input signal, demonstrating the essential principles of low-pass filtering.

### Terminology  

**RC Low-Pass Filter:** 

A circuit comprising a resistor (R) and capacitor (C) that allows low-frequency signals to pass while attenuating high-frequency signals.  

**Capacitive Reactance (\(X_c\)):** 

The opposition to current flow by a capacitor, inversely proportional to the signal frequency (\(X_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}\)).  

**Cutoff Frequency:** 

The frequency at which the filter begins significantly attenuating the signal, determined by the resistor and capacitor values (\(f_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi R C}\)).  

### Setup  

#### Components  

- Function generator (square wave, 1 kHz, 5V)  
- Oscilloscopes (for input and output signals)  
- 1 kΩ resistor  
- 10 µF capacitor  

### Steps  

#### **Step 1: **  

1. **Place the Resistor:**  
   - Connect a 1 kΩ resistor between g4 and g8 on the breadboard.  

2. **Add the Capacitor:**  
   - Connect one terminal of a 10 µF capacitor to h8 (the resistor's output).  
   - Connect the other terminal of the capacitor to the negative power rail using a black wire from f9.  

3. **Complete the Connections:**  
   - Connect the resistor's input (j4) to the positive power rail using a red wire.  

#### **Step 2: Configure the Input Signal**  

1. **Set Up the Function Generator:**  

   - Configure the function generator to produce a square wave with a frequency of 1 kHz and a peak amplitude of ±5V.  
   - Connect its positive and negative terminals to the respective power rails.  

2. **Monitor the Input Signal:**  
   - Attach an oscilloscope to observe the input signal:  
     - Connect the oscilloscope's positive terminal to the positive power rail.  
     - Connect the oscilloscope's negative terminal to the function generator's negative terminal.  
   - Run the simulation to confirm the square waveform.  

#### **Step 3: Monitor the Output Signal**  

1. **Set Up the Output Oscilloscope:**  
   - Connect the oscilloscope’s positive terminal to f8 (across the capacitor).  
   - Connect the oscilloscope’s negative terminal to the negative power rail.  

2. **Run the Simulation:**  
   - Observe the output waveform at different frequencies.  

### Observations  

#### **Low Frequencies (1 Hz):**  

- The capacitor charges and discharges slowly, allowing most of the signal to pass through.  
- The output resembles the input square wave, with slightly rounded edges due to smoothing.  

#### **Intermediate Frequencies (100 Hz – 1.42 kHz):**  

- The capacitor begins to resist the signal, attenuating the output.  
- At 100 Hz, the square wave transitions into a sawtooth shape due to the capacitor’s charging and discharging patterns.  
- At 1.42 kHz, the output voltage drops to millivolt levels, effectively blocking most of the high-frequency signal.  

#### **High Frequencies (7.33 kHz – 1 MHz):**  

- The capacitor charges and discharges so rapidly that it appears as an open circuit.  
- The output voltage is negligible, measured in microvolts at 1 MHz.  

#### Behavior of the RC Circuit  

1. **Low Frequencies:**  
   - At low frequencies, the capacitive reactance (\(X_c\)) is high, allowing the capacitor to charge and discharge more slowly.  
   - This enables low-frequency signals to pass through with minimal attenuation.  

2. **High Frequencies:**  
   - At high frequencies, \(X_c\) decreases, and the capacitor effectively acts as a short circuit, bypassing high-frequency components to ground.  
   - The output voltage across the capacitor becomes negligible.  

3. **Transition Region:**  
   - Near the cutoff frequency, the capacitor begins attenuating the signal.  
   - The square wave transitions into smoother waveforms, such as sawtooth shapes, due to the capacitor’s gradual response to rapid transitions.  

The RC low-pass filter demonstrates the capacitor’s role in selectively attenuating high-frequency signals:  

1. **Low-Frequency Behavior:** 

The circuit allows low-frequency signals to pass through with minimal attenuation.  

2. **High-Frequency Behavior:** 

The capacitor blocks high-frequency signals, effectively reducing their amplitude to near-zero levels.  

3. **Signal Smoothing:** 

The filter transitions square waves into smoother forms at intermediate frequencies, illustrating its ability to reshape signals.  

#### Applications

- Signal Conditioning: Filtering out noise from signals.  
- Power Supplies: Smoothing voltage ripples after rectification.  
- Audio Systems: Separating low-frequency bass signals from higher frequencies.  

By understanding and observing these behaviors, engineers can design effective filtering circuits for a wide range of applications.
