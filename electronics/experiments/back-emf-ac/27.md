#### **Step 2: Run the Simulation**  

1. **Observe LED Behavior:**  
   - Ensure the switch is in the "ON" position to close the circuit.  
   - Run the simulation and observe the LEDs:  
     - The **blue LED** lights up during the positive half-cycle of the square wave.  
     - The **red LED** lights up during the negative half-cycle as the current reverses.  
   - The LEDs alternate as the square wave transitions between positive and negative voltages.

### Analysis  

#### Behavior of the Inductive Circuit  

1. **Back EMF Generation:**  
   - Each time the square wave switches polarity, the inductor generates a back EMF to oppose the rapid change in current direction.  
   - This behavior causes a momentary flow of energy even during transitions, sustaining current through the circuit.  

2. **LED Behavior:**  
   - The **blue LED** lights up during the positive half of the square wave, as the current flows in its forward direction.  
   - The **red LED** lights up during the negative half of the square wave, as the current reverses and forward-biases the red LED.  

3. **Inductive Energy Storage:**  
   - The inductor stores energy in its magnetic field during each half-cycle.  
   - When the polarity reverses, the inductor releases this energy, ensuring smooth transitions in current flow.

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of an inductive circuit with an alternating current (AC) square wave input. It demonstrates the principles of back electromotive force (EMF) and current direction reversal in response to the AC signal.

   - The function generator produces a square wave signal alternating between positive and negative voltages.
   - As the voltage alternates, the current direction through the circuit also alternates, turning the LEDs on and off based on their polarity.

   - The inductor responds to the square wave by generating a back EMF each time the current direction changes.
   - The inductor opposes rapid changes in current, causing energy to flow momentarily even as the signal switches polarity.

   - The blue LED lights up during the positive half of the square wave, as current flows in the forward direction for that LED.
   - The red LED lights up during the negative half of the square wave, as the current direction reverses and forward-biases the red LED.

   - The inductor momentarily stores energy in its magnetic field during each half-cycle and releases it when the square wave reverses.
   - This transient behavior demonstrates the role of inductors in managing current flow during polarity changes.
