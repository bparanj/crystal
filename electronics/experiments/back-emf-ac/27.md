### Context and Problem

This experiment shows the behavior of an inductive circuit with a AC input. You will see the back EMF and current direction reversal in action. By replacing the DC power source with an AC square wave, we observe how inductors interact with alternating signals and how current flow affects polarized components such as LEDs.

### Terminology

**Back EMF (Electromotive Force):**

The voltage generated by an inductor when the current flowing through it changes direction.

**AC Square Wave:**

A periodic waveform that alternates between positive and negative voltage, creating rapid transitions in current direction.

**Polarity Reversal:**

The change in current direction caused by the alternating voltage of the AC signal.

#### Components

- Function generator (AC square wave, 1 Hz, 8V, 0 DC offset)
- 50 Ω resistor
- 1 H inductor
- Slide switch
- Red LED
- Blue LED

1. **Observe LED Behavior:**

   - The switch must be in the ON position to close the circuit.
   - Run the simulation and observe the LEDs:
     - The **blue LED** lights up during the positive half-cycle of the square wave.
     - The **red LED** lights up during the negative half-cycle as the current reverses.
   - The LEDs alternate as the square wave transitions between positive and negative voltages.

2. **Replace the DC Source with the Function Generator:**

   - Configure the function generator to output a square wave signal with:
     - Frequency: 1 Hz
     - Amplitude: ±8V
     - DC Offset: 0V
   - Connect the positive terminal of the function generator to the positive power rail and the negative terminal to the negative power rail.

#### Behavior of the Inductive Circuit

1. **Back EMF Generation:**

   - Each time the square wave switches polarity, the inductor generates a back EMF to oppose the rapid change in current direction.
   - This behavior causes a momentary flow of energy even during transitions, sustaining current through the circuit.

2. **LED Behavior:**

   - The **blue LED** lights up during the positive half of the square wave, as the current flows in its forward direction.
   - The **red LED** lights up during the negative half of the square wave, as the current reverses and forward-biases the red LED.

3. **Inductive Energy Storage:**

   - The inductor stores energy in its magnetic field during each half-cycle.
   - When the polarity reverses, the inductor releases this energy, ensuring smooth transitions in current flow.

This experiment demonstrates how inductors and polarized components behave in AC circuits:

   - Inductors generate back EMF to oppose changes in current, stabilizing the circuit during rapid polarity changes.
   - The alternating behavior of the LEDs provides a visual representation of current direction changes caused by the AC signal.
   - Inductors store energy in magnetic fields and release it during transitions. They are used to manage current flow in AC circuits.

### Applications

1. **AC Circuits:**

   - Demonstrates how inductors interact with alternating signals, providing stability and energy transfer in circuits like transformers and power supplies.

2. **Back EMF Management:**

   - Highlights the role of back EMF in motors, relays, and other inductive systems where current changes rapidly.

3. **Current Direction Monitoring:**

   - Provides a practical way to visualize current direction changes in AC circuits using polarized components like LEDs.

This experiment shows how inductors behave with AC signals. It illustrates how back EMF and current direction reversal affect circuit.

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of an inductive circuit with an alternating current (AC) square wave input. It demonstrates the principles of back electromotive force (EMF) and current direction reversal in response to the AC signal.

- The function generator produces a square wave signal alternating between positive and negative voltages.
- As the voltage alternates, the current direction through the circuit also alternates, turning the LEDs on and off based on their polarity.
- The inductor responds to the square wave by generating a back EMF each time the current direction changes.
- The inductor opposes rapid changes in current, causing energy to flow momentarily even as the signal switches polarity.
- The blue LED lights up during the positive half of the square wave, as current flows in the forward direction for that LED.
- The red LED lights up during the negative half of the square wave, as the current direction reverses and forward-biases the red LED.
- The inductor momentarily stores energy in its magnetic field during each half-cycle and releases it when the square wave reverses.
- This transient behavior demonstrates the role of inductors in managing current flow during polarity changes.
