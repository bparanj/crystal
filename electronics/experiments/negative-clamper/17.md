The output shows that the sine wave form has shifted below the horizontal line.

The diode allows current to flow in one direction, clamping or holding the voltage to a certain level.

This clamping circuit shifts the voltage waveform.

- During the negative half-cycle of an AC waveform, the diode conducts, allowing the capacitor to charge.
- During the positive half-cycle, the diode blocks current, and the capacitor holds its charge.
- The effect is a shift in the entire waveform upwards or downwards, depending on the configuration, without altering the shape of the AC signal.

This is called a clamping circuit or DC restorer because it shifts the waveform to add or remove a DC offset. It shifts the waveform downward, it's a negative clamping circuit.

### Context and Problem

The negative clamping circuit is designed to shift an AC waveform downward, introducing a negative DC offset without altering the shape of the waveform. This is accomplished by selectively charging and discharging a capacitor in response to the polarity of the AC signal, using a diode to direct current flow. This is useful in applications requiring waveform manipulation, such as signal processing or DC restoration.

### Terminology

**Clamping Circuit:**

A circuit that shifts an AC waveform vertically by adding or subtracting a DC offset while preserving the waveform shape.

**Polarized Capacitor:**

A capacitor with specific polarity requirements, used here to store and release charge based on the circuit's behavior.

**Diode:**

A component that allows current to flow in one direction, enabling selective charging of the capacitor.

**DC Offset:**

A constant voltage added or removed from an AC waveform, changing its reference point on the vertical axis.

#### Components

- Polarized capacitor (10 µF, 16V)
- Diode
- Resistor (10 kΩ)
- Function generator (1000 Hz, 15V)
- Oscilloscope

### Steps

#### **Step 1: **

   - Insert a 10 µF, 16V polarized capacitor into positions h4 and h6 on the breadboard.
   - Ensure the positive terminal is correctly oriented, as indicated in the images.

   - Place the diode at d11 and f11.
   - Connect its cathode (negative terminal) to the negative power rail using a black wire from a13.

   - Connect h13 to h17 (green wire) and ensure the capacitor is parallel to the diode-resistor combination.

#### **Step 2:

   - Set the function generator to produce a 1000 Hz sine wave with a 15V peak amplitude.
   - Connect its positive and negative terminals to the respective power rails.
   - Insert a 10 kΩ resistor between d17 and f17.
   - Connect it to the negative power rail using a black wire from a17.

   - Connect h13 to h17 (green wire) and ensure the capacitor is parallel to the diode-resistor combination.

#### **Step 3:

   - Attach the second oscilloscope to the output of the circuit:
     - Negative terminal to the negative power rail.
     - Positive terminal to i17 on the breadboard.
     - Set the oscilloscope's time division to **0.2 ms**.

   - Attach an oscilloscope to monitor the input signal:
     - Negative terminal to the function generator's negative terminal.
     - Positive terminal to the function generator's positive terminal.
   - Adjust the oscilloscope’s time division to **0.2 ms**.

   - Observe the sine wave input on the oscilloscope, confirming the signal generated by the function generator.
   - Observe both input and output signals simultaneously on the oscilloscopes.

#### Behavior of the Negative Clamping Circuit

**During the Negative Half-Cycle:**

The diode conducts, allowing the capacitor to charge. The capacitor develops a potential that opposes the negative voltage, clamping the waveform downward.

**During the Positive Half-Cycle:**

The diode blocks current, and the capacitor holds its charge. This maintains the downward shift of the waveform.

The result is a sine wave shifted downward along the vertical axis, introducing a negative DC offset. The shape of the waveform remains unchanged, demonstrating the clamping action.

The negative clamping circuit achieves a downward shift of an AC waveform, adding a controlled DC offset without distorting the waveform. Key principles include:

1. **Role of the Diode:** Ensuring unidirectional current flow to selectively charge the capacitor during specific portions of the AC cycle.
2. **Capacitor Dynamics:** Storing and holding charge to maintain the DC offset.
3. **Waveform Integrity:** Shifting the signal vertically while preserving its shape.

This clamping behavior is useful in applications like DC restoration, where maintaining waveform fidelity while adjusting the baseline is essential.
