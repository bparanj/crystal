### **Context**

This experiment demonstrates the use of a pushbutton as a manual control for current flow in a circuit. A pushbutton acts as a simple switch, allowing the user to open or close the circuit.

### **Problem Statement**

How does a pushbutton control the flow of current in a circuit? The goal is to demonstrate the pushbutton’s role as a switch that alternates between completing and breaking the circuit, visualized through the behavior of an LED.

### **Terminology**

**Pushbutton:** 

A momentary switch that connects or disconnects the circuit when pressed.

**Anode and Cathode of an LED:**
   - **Anode (longer leg):** Connects to the positive terminal.
   - **Cathode (shorter leg):** Connects to the negative terminal.

**Closed Circuit:** 

A complete path allowing current to flow.

**Open Circuit:** An incomplete path preventing current flow.

#### 1. **The Role of the Pushbutton**

A pushbutton allows manual control of the circuit. When pressed, it closes the circuit, allowing current to flow through the LED. When released, it opens the circuit, stopping the current flow and turning off the LED.

#### 2. **Building the Circuit**

The circuit is constructed step-by-step, connecting a battery, pushbutton, LED, and resistor. Each component plays a role in controlling and limiting current flow.

#### 3. **Observing and Explaining Behavior**

By pressing and releasing the pushbutton, we observe how it acts as a switch to control the LED.

### Steps

#### Components

- **Pushbutton**
- **Red LED**
- **Resistor (\(1 \, \text{k}\Omega\))**
- **9V Battery**

#### Step 1:

- Place the breadboard on your workspace.

#### Step 2: 

- Insert a **9V battery** and connect its negative terminal to the breadboard’s negative rail.

#### Step 3: 

- Position the pushbutton so it spans sections B and C of the breadboard, connecting points **f7**, **f9**, **e7**, and **e9**.

#### Step 4: 

- Insert the **LED** into the breadboard:
  - Connect the **anode (longer leg)** to **g6**.
  - Connect the **cathode (shorter leg)** to **f6**.

#### Step 5: 

- Connect a **\(1 \, \text{k}\Omega\)** resistor between **f6** and **d6**.

#### Step 6: 

- Connect **d6** (resistor) to the breadboard’s negative rail, ensuring the LED's cathode has a path to ground.

#### Step 7: 

- Link the pushbutton to the breadboard’s positive rail.

#### Step 8: 

- Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the breadboard’s positive rail. This completes the circuit.

1. **Run the Simulation:**
   - Begin by running the simulation in Tinkercad.

2. **Press the Pushbutton:**
   - Observe that pressing the pushbutton closes the circuit, allowing current to flow and the LED to light up.

3. **Release the Pushbutton:**
   - Notice that releasing the pushbutton opens the circuit, stopping the current flow and turning off the LED.

### **Observations**

- **When Pressed:** The pushbutton completes the circuit, allowing current to flow from the battery through the pushbutton, LED, and resistor, back to the battery’s negative terminal. The LED lights up.
- **When Released:** The circuit opens, interrupting current flow and turning off the LED.

### Results

1. **Pushbutton as a Switch:**
   - The pushbutton functions as a manual switch, controlling current flow with simple press-and-release action.

2. **Role of the Resistor:**
   - The resistor limits current to protect the LED from excessive current that could damage it.

3. **Practical Application:**
   - Pushbuttons are commonly used in electronic devices for user interaction, such as power buttons and input controls.

This experiment demonstrates how a pushbutton allows manual control of current flow in a circuit. By enabling or disabling current with a press, the pushbutton acts as a basic component in electronic control systems. The behavior of the LED provides a clear, visual demonstration of the circuit’s operation, reinforcing the concept of switching in electronics.
