Image 1 shows the negative terminal. You can see the negative sign in black. All the dots in the horizontal line at the top shown with green circles around the dots are connected together. They all provide connection for negative terminal. This is called the power rail.

Image 2 shows the positive terminal. You can see the positive sign in red. All the dots in this horizontal line are shown with green circles round them. These dots are connected together. They all provide connection for positive terminal. This is called the power rail.

Image 3 shows the negative terminal at the bottom of the breadboard. It is similar to the negative terminal at the top.

Image 4 shows the positive terminal at the bottom of the breadboard. It is similar to the positive terminal at the top.

Image 5 shows the dots are connected vertically. They are labeled f, g, h, i and j. They are connected together. Any component that are connected to this columwise dots will be connected to each other. The columns are numbered from 1 to 30. Each column provides a way to connect components. Each of those columns are separated, meaning they don't connect row wise.

Image 6 shows another vertical group of dots.

Image 7 shows the section that is similar to the section above. They are labeled a, b, c, d and e. This section is not connected to the section above. The numbers are the same 1 through 30 as the section above. They also provide connections only columnwise. They are isolated rowwise.

Image 8 shows another vertical group of dots for this section of the breadboard.

Basics of a Breadboard

### **Understanding the Basics of a Breadboard**

A breadboard is a prototyping tool for assembling circuits without soldering. Its structure is designed to simplify component connections by providing pre-connected rows and columns for organizing a circuit. Below, we explore the essential parts of a breadboard and how they are interconnected.

### **Power Rails**

#### **Negative Terminal (Top)**

- **Image 1:** The negative terminal is indicated by a **black minus sign (-)**. 
- The horizontal row marked in green circles connects all the dots along this line. This continuous connection forms the **negative power rail**.
- Any component connected to this row will share the same negative connection.

#### **Positive Terminal (Top)**

- **Image 2:** The positive terminal is indicated by a **red plus sign (+)**.
- Similarly, the dots in this horizontal row, marked with green circles, are connected. This is the **positive power rail**.
- Components connected here share the same positive voltage source.

#### **Negative and Positive Terminals (Bottom)**

- **Images 3 and 4:** The breadboard typically mirrors the power rails at the bottom. 
  - The bottom negative terminal works like the top one (black minus sign).
  - The bottom positive terminal functions like the top (red plus sign).
- These separate rows allow for additional power distribution.

### **Component Connection Points**

#### **Vertical Columns (Right Side)**

- **Image 5:** 
  - On the right-hand side, dots labeled **f, g, h, i, and j** are connected vertically. 
  - Each vertical column (e.g., column 1 or column 2) links all dots within it. Any component connected to these dots will be part of the same circuit path.
  - Columns are **numbered 1 through 30**. Each column provides a distinct connection point for components.

#### **Vertical Columns (Left Side)**

- **Image 7:**
  - On the left-hand side, dots labeled **a, b, c, d, and e** are also connected vertically. 
  - These columns function identically to the right-side columns but are independent of them.
  - The rows are again **numbered 1 through 30**, offering isolated vertical connections.

### **Isolation of Sections**

1. **Separation Between Left and Right Sections**
   - **Images 5 and 7:** The vertical columns on the left (a–e) and right (f–j) sides are electrically isolated from each other.
   - This separation allows for independent circuit sections within the same breadboard.

2. **Power Rail Independence**
   - The power rails (positive and negative) at the top and bottom are not connected to each other. This separation enables circuits to use multiple voltage levels or configurations.

### **Summary**

- **Power Rails:** The horizontal rows marked for positive and negative terminals distribute power across the breadboard.
- **Vertical Columns:** The dots in columns provide connection points for components, with left and right sections electrically isolated.
- **Independent Sections:** Each column and power rail operates independently, allowing flexible circuit design.

By understanding how breadboard connections are organized, you can efficiently assemble and modify circuits for prototyping and experimentation.
