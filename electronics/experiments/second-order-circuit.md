A second-order circuit typically includes two energy storage components, such as an inductor and a capacitor. These circuits exhibit behaviors like oscillation or overdamped/underdamped responses, depending on the component values. Here, we’ll design an RLC series circuit experiment in Tinkercad to observe transient response and resonance behavior.

### Components:

1. DC Power Source: 5V DC source.
2. Resistor: 1 kΩ resistor.
3. Capacitor: 10 µF capacitor.
4. Inductor: 10 mH inductor.
5. Switch: To control when the circuit is energized.
6. Oscilloscope: To observe the voltage across the capacitor.

### Circuit Setup:

1. Connect the Resistor, Inductor, and Capacitor in Series:
   - Connect one terminal of the resistor to the positive terminal of the 5V DC power source.
   - Connect the other terminal of the resistor to one terminal of the inductor.
   - Connect the other terminal of the inductor to one terminal of the capacitor.
   - Connect the other terminal of the capacitor to ground.

2. Place a Switch in Series with the Power Source:
   - Add a switch between the power source and the resistor. This switch will control when the circuit is energized, allowing us to observe the transient response of the RLC circuit.

3. Set Up the Oscilloscope:
   - Connect the oscilloscope probes across the capacitor (one probe on each terminal) to monitor the voltage across it as the circuit responds to the power source.

### Experiment Steps:

1. Observing the Transient Response (Step Response):
   - Start the simulation in Tinkercad.
   - With the switch open, no current flows in the circuit, and the capacitor voltage should be zero.
   - Close the switch to connect the 5V DC source to the circuit, initiating the transient response.
   - Observe the voltage across the capacitor on the oscilloscope.

2. Expected Results:
   - The nature of the voltage waveform across the capacitor will depend on the values of \( R \), \( L \), and \( C \):
     - Underdamped Response: If the circuit parameters are set so that the response is underdamped (e.g., lower resistance), you’ll see oscillations that gradually decay over time.
     - Critically Damped Response: With certain values of \( R \), \( L \), and \( C \), the response will rise to a peak without oscillating and settle quickly to the steady-state value.
     - Overdamped Response: With a higher resistance value, the response will slowly rise to the steady-state value without oscillating.

   - Formula for Resonant Frequency: The oscillation frequency (if underdamped) depends on the circuit’s natural frequency \( f_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{LC}} \), where \( L \) is the inductance and \( C \) is the capacitance.

3. Adjusting Component Values:
   - To observe different behaviors (underdamped, critically damped, overdamped), try adjusting the resistor value in Tinkercad. This will change the circuit’s damping factor and allow you to observe the different types of responses.
   - Experiment with different values of \( R \), keeping the capacitor and inductor values constant, and observe how the waveform across the capacitor changes.

Second-Order Behavior: The RLC circuit is a second-order system because it has two energy storage components: the inductor and the capacitor. These two components interact, leading to oscillatory or exponential behavior in the voltage or current.

Transient Response: The circuit’s transient response (the behavior immediately after switching on) is governed by the values of \( R \), \( L \), and \( C \), which dictate whether the response will oscillate, rise directly, or decay gradually.

Damping: The resistor \( R \) controls the damping of the circuit. Lower resistance allows oscillations, while higher resistance dampens the oscillations, affecting how quickly the system reaches steady-state.

This experiment provides insight into the dynamics of second-order circuits, helping you understand oscillatory behavior, damping, and resonance — all of which are fundamental concepts in electronics, particularly in signal processing and filter design.
