### **Context**

This experiment demonstrates the ability of a capacitor to pass AC signals while blocking DC signals. By using a capacitor in a circuit with an LED and a function generator, we observe how the capacitor responds to alternating voltage and the behavior of the LED as a visual indicator. This highlights the capacitor's role as an AC-coupling component in signal processing.

### **Problem Statement**

How does a capacitor allow AC signals to pass through a circuit while blocking DC signals? The goal is to illustrate the fundamental property of capacitors in filtering and coupling applications.

### **Terminology**

**Capacitor:** 

A component that stores energy in an electric field and opposes changes in voltage. It allows AC to pass through by charging and discharging with the alternating voltage but blocks steady DC signals after charging.

**AC Signal:** 

An alternating current that periodically reverses direction.

**DC Signal:** 

A direct current that flows in only one direction.

**AC-Coupling:** 

The process by which a capacitor allows AC signals to pass while blocking DC.

#### 1. **Capacitor Behavior with AC and DC**

Capacitors act as barriers to DC after they charge, as no steady current flows through their dielectric. However, in AC circuits, the changing voltage continuously charges and discharges the capacitor, allowing current to flow.

#### 2. **Setup**

This experiment uses a function generator, a capacitor, and an LED to demonstrate how AC signals pass through the capacitor to light the LED. Adjustments to the function generator and capacitor size help observe and explain variations in behavior.

#### 3. **Observations and Implications**

The capacitor allows AC signals to pass, lighting the LED. Reducing the frequency shows how slower charging and discharging cycles impact the LED's behavior. The capacitor’s role in filtering DC signals becomes evident when the DC offset is added or removed.

### **Steps**

#### Step 1:

- Place a breadboard for assembling the circuit.

#### Step 2: Add the LED

- Insert an **LED** between points **h4** and **h5**. Ensure:
  - **Anode (long leg):** Connected to the positive voltage.
  - **Cathode (short leg):** Connected to the capacitor.

#### Step 3: Add the Capacitor

- Place a **200 µF capacitor** between points **f9** and **f10**, with the positive terminal connected to the LED.

#### Step 4: Ground the Capacitor

- Connect the capacitor's negative terminal to the breadboard’s negative rail (ground) using a black wire.

#### Step 5: Connect the LED

- Link the LED to the capacitor using a green wire from **i5** to **i9**.

#### Step 6: Add the Function Generator

- Set the function generator to:
  - Waveform: **Sine wave**
  - Frequency: **1 kHz**
  - Amplitude: **5 volts peak-to-peak**
  - DC Offset: **0V**

- Connect the function generator:
  - Positive terminal to the breadboard’s positive rail.
  - Negative terminal to the negative rail.

#### Step 7: Run the Simulation

- Start the simulation in Tinkercad and observe the LED lighting up. The AC signal passes through the capacitor to the LED.

### **Experimenting with Frequency and DC Offset**

#### Lower Frequency (e.g., 100 Hz)

- Reduce the frequency of the function generator to **100 Hz**.
- Observe the LED blinking or dimming as the capacitor charges and discharges more slowly, reducing the average current through the LED.

#### Add DC Offset

- Increase the DC offset of the function generator to **2V**.
- Observe the LED lighting more steadily because the capacitor now passes both AC and the added DC component.

#### Remove AC Component

- Set the function generator to output only DC (remove AC).
- Observe the LED turning off, as the capacitor blocks pure DC once charged.

### **Observations**

1. **Initial State:**
   - At the start, the capacitor is uncharged and acts like a short circuit for AC, allowing current to flow freely.
   - The LED lights brightly.

2. **Steady State:**
   - As the capacitor charges with the AC signal, it develops a voltage across its terminals, reducing the current flow.
   - The LED appears dimmer or blinks at the AC frequency.

3. **DC Behavior:**
   - The capacitor blocks steady DC signals after charging, preventing the LED from lighting.

This experiment demonstrates the AC-coupling property of capacitors:
- **AC Signals:** Capacitors continuously charge and discharge with alternating voltage, allowing AC signals to pass through.
- **DC Signals:** Capacitors block steady DC after charging, highlighting their role in filtering.

Capacitors are used in circuits where AC signals need to pass while DC components are filtered out, such as in audio systems, signal processing, and power supplies. The experiment provides a demonstration of this behavior, with the LED as a visual indicator.

### Demonstrate Capacitor Passing AC Signal

This experiment shows how a capacitor allows AC signals to pass through the circuit but blocks DC signals.


1. Function Generator
2. LED (any color)
3. Capacitor: 100 µF (non-polarized is ideal, but polarized can be used with correct polarity)
4. Resistor: 330 Ω (to protect the LED)


   - Connect the other terminal of the resistor to the anode (long leg) of the LED.
   - Connect the cathode (short leg) of the LED to the negative rail of the breadboard.

   - The function generator acts as the signal source, so no external DC power supply is needed.

1. Set the function generator to:
   - Waveform: Sine wave.
   - Frequency: 1 kHz (or a similar low frequency for easier observation).
   - Amplitude: 5V peak-to-peak.
   - DC Offset: 0V (pure AC signal).

### Procedure

   - Run the simulation in Tinkercad.
   - The LED will blink rapidly or appear dim, as the AC signal passes through the capacitor.

2. Experiment with DC Offset:
   - Change the DC offset of the function generator to a positive value (e.g., 2V).
   - Observe how the LED lights up continuously because the capacitor now passes the AC signal combined with the DC offset.

3. Remove the AC Component:
   - Set the function generator to output only DC (remove the AC component).
   - Observe that the LED turns off, showing that the capacitor blocks pure DC signals.


- The capacitor blocks DC and allows AC to pass by continuously charging and discharging in response to the alternating voltage. The LED lights up when the capacitor passes the AC signal but remains off for pure DC.

This experiment demonstrates the AC-coupling property of a capacitor.

The LED is bright initially and then becomes dim because the capacitor charges over time, reducing the current flow through the circuit. Here’s why this happens:

1. Initial State:
   - When the circuit starts, the capacitor is uncharged, and it acts like a short circuit for the AC signal.
   - A high current flows through the circuit, lighting the LED brightly.

2. Charging Phase:
   - As the capacitor charges, it develops a voltage across its plates, opposing the flow of current.
   - Over time, the capacitor reaches a steady-state charge for the applied signal, reducing the effective current passing through the LED.

3. Steady State:
   - Once the capacitor is fully charged for DC components (or at equilibrium for AC signals), it blocks further DC current while allowing only the AC component of the signal to pass.
   - The reduced current through the LED makes it appear dimmer.

### Factors

- Capacitor Size: Larger capacitance takes longer to charge but can smooth out the signal more effectively.
- Frequency of Signal: At lower frequencies, the capacitor charges and discharges more slowly, affecting the LED's brightness.

### How to Observe Pure AC Behavior

To keep the LED brightness consistent:
- Ensure the signal is purely AC (set the function generator's DC offset to 0V).
- Use a smaller capacitor value (e.g., 10 µF) to reduce the charging time and focus on the AC response.

This behavior demonstrates the charging and discharging dynamics of the capacitor and its role in filtering DC components while passing AC.
