### **Context**

This experiment demonstrates the ability of a capacitor to pass AC signals while blocking DC signals. By using a capacitor in a circuit with an LED and a function generator, we observe how the capacitor responds to alternating voltage and the behavior of the LED as a visual indicator. This shows the capacitor's role as an AC-coupling component in signal processing.

### **Problem Statement**

How does a capacitor allow AC signals to pass through a circuit while blocking DC signals? The goal is to illustrate the basic property of capacitors in filtering and coupling applications.

### **Terminology**

**Capacitor:** 

A component that stores energy in an electric field and opposes changes in voltage. It allows AC to pass through by charging and discharging with the alternating voltage but blocks steady DC signals after charging.

**AC Signal:** 

An alternating current that periodically reverses direction.

**DC Signal:** 

A direct current that flows in only one direction.

**AC-Coupling:** 

The process by which a capacitor allows AC signals to pass while blocking DC.

Step 9

Start the simulation. You can see the LED turn on.

Step 10

Reduce the frequency to 1 Hz. The capacitor will turn on for a second and turn off.

The capacitor's resistance to AC is called reactance. It depends on the frequency of the AC signal, higher frequencies pass more easily.
