### Context and Problem

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of a capacitor in a DC circuit. A capacitor blocks direct current while allowing only a brief transient current during the charging phase. This is useful for designing circuits that use capacitors for signal processing, DC blocking, and energy storage.

### Terminology

**Capacitor:**

A component that stores electrical energy in an electric field and blocks the continuous flow of DC current.

**Transient Current:**

A temporary flow of current as a capacitor charges or discharges.

**DC Blocking:**

The property of a capacitor to prevent the steady-state flow of DC current once fully charged.

#### Components

- 1 kΩ resistor
- 100 nF capacitor
- 9V battery
- Multimeter

### Steps

#### **Step 1: Measure Current Without the Capacitor**

   - Place a 1 kΩ resistor between e4 and g4 on the breadboard.
   - Connect the resistor’s free terminal to the positive power rail using a red wire from j4.
   - Attach the battery’s positive terminal to the positive power rail and the negative terminal to the negative power rail.

   - Set the multimeter to measure current.
   - Connect its positive terminal to the resistor’s free end.
   - Connect its negative terminal to the negative power rail.

   - Observe the current measurement.
   - Result: \( 8.99 \, \text{mA} \), consistent with Ohm’s Law:
     \[
     I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{9}{1000} = 8.99 \, \text{mA}.
     \]

#### **Step 2: Measure Current With the Capacitor Added**

   - Remove the multimeter temporarily.
   - Place a 100 nF capacitor between b4 and b5 on the breadboard, connecting it in series with the resistor.
   - Reconnect the multimeter:
     - Positive terminal to the capacitor’s free end at a5.
     - Negative terminal to the negative power rail.

   - Observe the current measurement.
   - Result: \( 0 \, \text{mA} \).

#### Behavior of the Circuit

1. **Without the Capacitor:**
   - The circuit operates as a simple resistive circuit.
   - Current flows continuously, governed by Ohm’s Law, as there is no impedance other than the resistor.

2. **With the Capacitor:**
   - Initially, if the capacitor were uncharged, a brief transient current would flow as the capacitor charges.
   - Once fully charged, the capacitor acts as an open circuit, blocking the flow of DC current.

3. **Transient Current (Not Measured Here):**
   - The capacitor temporarily allows current to flow during the charging phase.
   - After charging, no further current flows because the capacitor prevents a continuous flow of charge in a DC circuit.

This experiment demonstrates the capacitor’s role as a DC blocker:

1. **Blocking DC Current:**
   - Once charged, the capacitor prevents any steady-state DC current from flowing through the circuit.

2. **Transient Behavior:**
   - Capacitors only allow current to flow temporarily during the charging or discharging phases.

3. **Applications:**
   - Capacitors are commonly used in circuits to block DC components while allowing AC signals, such as in coupling and decoupling applications in amplifiers.

Capacitors are used in circuits that require DC blocking or transient response management. Capacitors behave differently in DC and AC circuits.

PENDING

Summarize:

This experiment demonstrates how capacitors block DC current while allowing initial transient currents during charging.

Capacitors Block DC Current:

When a capacitor is added in series with the resistor, the steady-state current through the circuit drops to 0 mA because a fully charged capacitor blocks the flow of DC current.

This demonstrates that capacitors do not allow a continuous flow of DC current. They only allow current to flow temporarily while charging.

Series Circuit Behavior:

The experiment shows the difference in current flow with and without a capacitor in a series circuit.

In the presence of a capacitor, the circuit becomes open once the capacitor is fully charged.

Transient Current:

If the capacitor were initially uncharged, a brief current would flow as the capacitor charges. However, once fully charged, the current would drop to zero.

Capacitors in DC Circuits:

Used to block DC current while allowing AC signals in mixed circuits.

Capacitors temporarily store charge, which can be used in pulsed or transient applications.

Demonstrates the importance of understanding how components behave differently in DC and AC circuits.
