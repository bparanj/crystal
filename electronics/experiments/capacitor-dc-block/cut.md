They block DC current while allowing AC current to flow.

1. Ohmâ€™s Law and Current Measurement:
   - Initially, with just the resistor in the circuit, the current through the resistor is measured using a multimeter.
   - The current value is determined by Ohm's Law: \( I = \frac{V}{R} \), where \( V = 9 \, \text{V} \) and \( R \) is the resistor value.
