### Context and Problem  

This experiment visually demonstrates the principle that current in a parallel circuit flows preferentially through paths with lower resistance. By using LEDs of the same color and resistors with significantly different values, we observe the difference in brightness to understand how current distributes itself across parallel branches.

### Key Definitions  

- **Parallel Circuit:** A circuit configuration where components are connected across the same voltage source, creating multiple paths for current flow.  
- **Path of Least Resistance:** The branch with the lowest resistance in a parallel circuit allows the highest current flow, as described by Ohm’s Law (\(I = \frac{V}{R}\)).  
- **LED Brightness:** The brightness of an LED correlates with the amount of current flowing through it, making it a visual indicator of current distribution.

### Steps and Observations  

#### **Step 1: Construct the Circuit**  

1. **Place the Resistors:**  
   - Insert the 10 kΩ resistor between e6 and g6 on the breadboard.  
   - Insert the 500 kΩ resistor between e12 and g12.  

2. **Add the LEDs:**  
   - Connect one LED between c6 (anode) and c7 (cathode), with its anode connected to the 10 kΩ resistor.  
   - Connect the second LED between c12 (anode) and c13 (cathode), with its anode connected to the 500 kΩ resistor.  

3. **Complete the Connections:**  
   - Connect the cathodes of both LEDs to the negative power rail using black wires.  
   - Connect the free ends of both resistors to the positive power rail using red wires.  

4. **Power the Circuit:**  
   - Attach the 9V battery to the breadboard, connecting its positive and negative terminals to the respective power rails.

#### **Step 2: Run the Simulation**  

1. **Observe LED Brightness:**  
   - The LED connected to the 10 kΩ resistor is noticeably brighter than the LED connected to the 500 kΩ resistor.

### Analysis  

#### Current Distribution in Parallel Circuits  

1. **Ohm’s Law in Each Branch:**  
   - Current in each branch is determined by \(I = \frac{V}{R}\), where \(V\) is the same across all branches.  
   - For the 10 kΩ resistor:  
     \[
     I_{10k} = \frac{9}{10,000} = 0.0009 \, \text{A} \, (0.9 \, \text{mA})
     \]  
   - For the 500 kΩ resistor:  
     \[
     I_{500k} = \frac{9}{500,000} = 0.000018 \, \text{A} \, (18 \, \mu \text{A})
     \]  

2. **LED Brightness as a Current Indicator:**  
   - The LED in the 10 kΩ branch is brighter because it receives significantly more current compared to the LED in the 500 kΩ branch.  

---

### Key Insights  

1. **Path of Least Resistance:**  
   - Current prefers the path with the lower resistance, as shown by the brightness difference in the LEDs.  

2. **Parallel Circuit Behavior:**  
   - While the total voltage across each branch is the same, the current divides inversely proportional to the resistance in each path.  

3. **Visualization with LEDs:**  
   - LEDs act as effective visual indicators of current flow, allowing for easy comparison of current distribution in parallel circuits.

### Applications  

1. **Circuit Design:**  
   - Understanding current distribution is critical for designing parallel circuits to avoid overloading components.  

2. **Power Management:**  
   - Helps in ensuring balanced current flow in parallel branches for reliable circuit operation.  

3. **Fault Diagnosis:**  
   - Observing differences in LED brightness can assist in identifying issues such as incorrect resistor values or faulty connections.  

This experiment provides a clear visual demonstration of how current flows through parallel paths based on resistance, reinforcing foundational principles of circuit design and analysis.

To show that current prefers to flow through a lower resistance path in a parallel circuit.

- 1 Power Source (e.g., 9V battery)
- 2 Resistors (one with a low resistance, like 100 Ω, and another with a higher resistance, like 1 kΩ)
- 2 LEDs (to indicate current flow through each branch)
- Breadboard and Wires

- When you connect the battery, both LEDs should light up. However, the LED in the path with the 100 Ω resistor will be noticeably brighter than the LED in the path with the 1 kΩ resistor.
- This is because the lower resistance path (100 Ω) allows more current to flow through it, making the LED brighter in that branch.

In a parallel circuit, the branch with lower resistance will allow more current to flow compared to the higher resistance branch. This experiment visually demonstrates that current favors the path with the least resistance, as shown by the brightness difference in the LEDs.
