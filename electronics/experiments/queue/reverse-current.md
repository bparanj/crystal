Here’s how to design a simple experiment in Tinkercad to demonstrate reverse current protection using a diode.

### Objective

To show how a diode can protect components from damage by blocking reverse current in a circuit.

### Components

1. Breadboard
2. 9V battery
3. Diode (e.g., 1N4007 or similar)
4. Red LED
5. Resistor (1 kΩ) for current limiting

### Steps

1. Set Up the Power Supply:
   - Place the 9V battery on the breadboard.
   - Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive rail of the breadboard.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative rail of the breadboard.

2. Add the Reverse Protection Diode:
   - Place the diode on the breadboard.
   - Connect the anode (positive side) of the diode to the positive rail of the breadboard.
   - Connect the cathode (negative side) of the diode (marked with a line) to a new row on the breadboard. This configuration allows current to flow only when the battery is connected in the correct polarity.

3. Connect the LED with Current-Limiting Resistor:
   - Place the 1 kΩ resistor on the breadboard and connect one end to the same row as the cathode of the diode.
   - Connect the anode of the LED to the other end of the resistor.
   - Connect the cathode of the LED to the negative rail of the breadboard.

4. Run the Simulation (Correct Polarity):
   - In this configuration, the diode is forward-biased, allowing current to flow from the battery, through the diode, the resistor, and the LED.
   - The LED should turn on, showing that the circuit is working properly.

5. Reverse the Battery (Incorrect Polarity):
   - Swap the battery connections so that the positive terminal is connected to the negative rail and the negative terminal to the positive rail.
   - Now, the diode is reverse-biased, blocking current from flowing through the circuit.

6. Run the Simulation (Incorrect Polarity):
   - With the battery in reverse, the LED should remain off because the diode blocks current from flowing. This demonstrates that the diode provides reverse current protection by preventing damage from incorrect polarity.

Forward-Biased Diode (Correct Polarity): When the battery is connected correctly, the diode allows current to flow, and the LED lights up.

Reverse-Biased Diode (Incorrect Polarity): When the battery is reversed, the diode blocks the current, preventing it from reaching the LED, which remains off. This demonstrates how a diode can protect components from reverse current damage.

This experiment demonstrates reverse current protection by using a diode in series with the circuit. The diode allows current to flow only in the correct direction, protecting sensitive components (like the LED) from potential damage if the power supply is connected in reverse.
