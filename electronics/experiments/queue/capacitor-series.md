What happens when capacitor is connected in series?

When capacitors are connected in series, their total or equivalent capacitance decreases.

### 1. Decreased Total Capacitance

   - In a series connection, the total capacitance \(C_{\text{total}}\) is given by the formula:
     \[
     \frac{1}{C_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{C_n}
     \]
   - This means that the total capacitance is less than the smallest individual capacitor in the series. This occurs because, in a series circuit, each capacitor shares the same charge, so it effectively reduces the overall storage capacity.

### 2. Increased Voltage Handling

Capacitors in series share the applied voltage. Therefore, the voltage rating of the series combination increases. The total voltage rating is the sum of each capacitor’s voltage rating, so this setup is useful in applications requiring higher voltage handling.

### 3. Equal Charge Storage

When capacitors are connected in series, they all store the same amount of electric charge \(Q\), regardless of their individual capacitance values. This is because the charge on each capacitor must balance out along the entire series path.

 - Higher Voltage Tolerance: Series capacitors are beneficial in circuits requiring a higher voltage tolerance than any single capacitor can handle.
 - Reduced Capacitance: The overall capacitance decreases, which can limit the ability of the circuit to store energy but can be useful for tuning circuit response times, such as in filters or timing circuits.

Series capacitors are often used in applications where voltage requirements exceed the ratings of individual capacitors, but this configuration comes at the cost of reduced total capacitance.

You can use Tinkercad to demonstrate the effect of connecting capacitors in series by observing how the total capacitance changes compared to a single capacitor. In this experiment, we’ll measure the charge and discharge behavior of capacitors connected in series and compare it to a single capacitor.

### Components:

1. DC Power Supply: 9V DC source.
2. Capacitors: Two capacitors of equal value, such as 10 µF each.
3. Resistor: 1 kΩ resistor (for controlling the charging and discharging rate).
4. Switch: To control charging and discharging.
5. Multimeter: To measure the voltage across the capacitors.
6. Oscilloscope: (Optional) To observe the voltage changes over time.

### Setup:

1. Single Capacitor Setup (Reference Measurement):
   - Connect one terminal of the DC power source to one end of the resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to the positive terminal of a 10 µF capacitor.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the capacitor to the ground terminal of the power supply.
   - Place a switch in series with the capacitor to control charging and discharging.
   - Attach the multimeter across the capacitor to measure voltage.

2. Series Capacitor Setup:
   - Replace the single capacitor with two capacitors in series:
     - Connect the positive terminal of the first capacitor to the resistor.
     - Connect the negative terminal of the first capacitor to the positive terminal of the second capacitor.
     - Connect the negative terminal of the second capacitor to ground.
   - Place the switch in the same position as before.
   - Attach the multimeter across both capacitors to measure the combined voltage.

### Steps:

1. Step 1: Charge a Single Capacitor:
   - Set up the circuit with a single capacitor.
   - Close the switch to start charging the capacitor.
   - Observe the voltage across the capacitor using the multimeter or oscilloscope.
   - Expected Outcome: The capacitor will gradually charge to the full supply voltage (9V in this case). Record the time taken for the capacitor to reach close to the full voltage (around 5V, which represents the time constant).

2. Step 2: Charge Capacitors in Series:
   - Replace the single capacitor with two capacitors in series.
   - Close the switch to charge the series capacitors.
   - Observe the voltage across the series combination using the multimeter or oscilloscope.
   - Expected Outcome: The total voltage across the two capacitors in series will still reach the supply voltage (9V), but each capacitor will hold a lower voltage. Additionally, the charging rate will appear slower because the equivalent capacitance is reduced.

3. Step 3: Compare Discharge Rates:
   - Open the switch to allow the capacitors to discharge through the resistor.
   - Observe the time it takes for the voltage to drop, and compare this with the time taken for the single capacitor to discharge.
   - Expected Outcome: The series capacitors will discharge more slowly than a single capacitor of the same value due to the reduced equivalent capacitance.

Total Capacitance:

The two capacitors in series result in a reduced total capacitance, which can be calculated using:
  \[
  C_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}}
  \]
  For two 10 µF capacitors in series, the total capacitance is 5 µF.

Voltage Distribution:

Each capacitor in series will have a portion of the total voltage (e.g., around 4.5V each in this case, if they’re identical).

Charge and Discharge Rates:

The reduced capacitance leads to a slower charge and discharge rate compared to a single 10 µF capacitor, demonstrating how capacitors in series impact circuit behavior.

This experiment allows you to visualize how connecting capacitors in series affects total capacitance and charging/discharging behavior, which is valuable in understanding circuit design and component selection.

Here’s a simple experiment you can set up in Tinkercad to demonstrate the behavior of two capacitors connected in series.

### Objective
To show that when two capacitors are connected in series, the total capacitance is lower than that of either capacitor alone, and to observe how this affects the charge and discharge time in an RC circuit.

### Components Needed in Tinkercad
1. Breadboard
2. DC Power Supply (e.g., 9V battery)
3. Two capacitors (e.g., 100 µF each)
4. Resistor (1 kΩ) to control current flow
5. LED to observe discharge behavior
6. Switch to control charging and discharging
7. Multimeter (optional) to measure voltage across the capacitors

### Steps

1. Set Up the Power Supply:
   - Place the 9V battery on the breadboard.
   - Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive rail of the breadboard.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative rail of the breadboard.

2. Connect Two Capacitors in Series:
   - Place the first capacitor on the breadboard, connecting one terminal to the positive rail where the battery is connected.
   - Connect the other terminal of the first capacitor to a new row.
   - Place the second capacitor on the breadboard, connecting one terminal to the first capacitor’s open terminal.
   - Connect the other terminal of the second capacitor to a new row, creating a series connection between the two capacitors.

3. Add a Resistor and LED in Series:
   - Place a 1 kΩ resistor in series with the LED. Connect one end of the resistor to the open terminal of the second capacitor.
   - Connect the anode (longer leg) of the LED to the other end of the resistor.
   - Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of the LED to the negative rail of the breadboard. This completes the RC circuit, with the LED acting as a visual indicator of the charge and discharge behavior.

4. Add a Switch to Control Charging and Discharging:
   - Place a switch between the positive rail and the capacitors, allowing you to control when the capacitors are connected to the battery and start charging.
   
5. Attach a Multimeter (Optional):
   - Set up a multimeter in Tinkercad to measure the voltage across both capacitors. This helps you observe the charging behavior more precisely.

6. Run the Simulation (Charging Cycle):
   - Close the switch to allow the capacitors to start charging from the battery.
   - Observe the LED: as the capacitors charge, current flows through the LED, and it will light up initially, then dim as the capacitors reach their full charge.
   - You should see the voltage reading on the multimeter gradually increase, showing the slower charging time due to the reduced capacitance.

7. Run the Simulation (Discharging Cycle):
   - Open the switch to disconnect the capacitors from the battery.
   - The capacitors will begin to discharge through the resistor and LED, and the LED will light up again briefly, dimming as the capacitors discharge.
   - Note the discharge time, which will be affected by the series connection of the capacitors.

### Explanation of Series Capacitance

When capacitors are connected in series, the total capacitance \( C_{\text{total}} \) is lower than that of each individual capacitor. The formula for calculating total capacitance for two capacitors \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) in series is:
\[
\frac{1}{C_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}
\]
For two 100 µF capacitors in series, the total capacitance would be:
\[
C_{\text{total}} = \frac{100 \, \mu\text{F} \times 100 \, \mu\text{F}}{100 \, \mu\text{F} + 100 \, \mu\text{F}} = 50 \, \mu\text{F}
\]
This lower capacitance means that the capacitors store less total charge for the same applied voltage and take a shorter time to discharge compared to a single 100 µF capacitor.

### Observations

- Reduced Total Capacitance: The two capacitors in series result in a total capacitance that is lower than each individual capacitor, meaning the circuit will store less energy.
- Faster Charging and Discharging: Due to the reduced capacitance, the capacitors charge and discharge faster than a single capacitor of 100 µF would.


This experiment demonstrates that connecting capacitors in series reduces the total capacitance, which affects the charging and discharging time of an RC circuit. In practical circuits, series capacitors are used to reduce capacitance or increase voltage tolerance.
