The simplest experiment to demonstrate resonance in electronics is the LC circuit (inductor-capacitor circuit).

1. Components:
   - Inductor (L)
   - Capacitor (C)
   - AC signal generator (to provide varying frequencies)
   - Oscilloscope or multimeter (to observe voltage across the circuit)

2. Setup:
   - Connect the inductor and capacitor in series to form an LC circuit.
   - Attach the AC signal generator across the LC circuit.
   - Use the oscilloscope or multimeter to measure the voltage across the circuit.

3. Procedure:
   - Start the signal generator at a low frequency and gradually increase it.
   - Observe the voltage across the LC circuit. At a particular frequency (the resonant frequency), the voltage across the circuit will reach its maximum. This happens because the inductive and capacitive reactances cancel each other out, allowing maximum current to flow.

4. Observing Resonance:
   - The resonant frequency, \( f_0 \), can be calculated with the formula:
     \[
     f_0 = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{LC}}
     \]
   - At this frequency, the circuit stores and transfers energy back and forth between the inductor and capacitor, amplifying the voltage.

This experiment is simple and demonstrates resonance, as you can see the voltage peaking at the resonant frequency.

The simplest resonance experiment in electronics would be an LC circuit (also called a tank circuit), consisting of just two components:

1. An inductor (L)
2. A capacitor (C)

When connected in parallel, these components will naturally oscillate at their resonant frequency. You can demonstrate this by:

1. Charging the capacitor with a battery
2. Disconnecting the battery
3. The circuit will oscillate as energy transfers back and forth between:
   - Magnetic field in the inductor
   - Electric field in the capacitor

This is analogous to the swing example:
- The capacitor stores energy like the swing at its highest point (potential energy)
- The inductor carries current like the swing at its lowest point (kinetic energy)

The resonant frequency (f) is determined by:
f = 1/(2π√LC)

More practical demonstrations often add:
- A resistor to see the damping effect
- An oscilloscope to visualize the oscillations
- A function generator to drive the circuit at different frequencies

But the basic LC circuit remains the simplest demonstration of electronic resonance.
