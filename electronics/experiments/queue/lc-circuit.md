An LC resonant circuit and an LC circuit are essentially the same thing - they both refer to an electrical circuit containing an inductor (L) and a capacitor (C). However, the term "LC resonant circuit" specifically emphasizes the circuit's resonant behavior.

Key points to understand:
1. When people say "LC circuit," they usually mean a circuit that exhibits resonance
2. These circuits naturally oscillate at their resonant frequency when energized
3. The resonant frequency depends on the values of L and C: f = 1/(2π√LC)

The "resonant" in "LC resonant circuit" just makes explicit what the circuit is primarily used for - its ability to resonate at a specific frequency. This property makes these circuits useful in:
- Radio tuning circuits
- Frequency filters
- Oscillators
- Signal processing
