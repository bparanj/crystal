This principle arises from the fundamental characteristics of voltage and current sources and their ability to maintain their defining properties under different loads.

### Voltage Source Characteristics:

- A good voltage source maintains a constant voltage across its terminals regardless of the current drawn by the load.
- For this, the internal resistance of the voltage source should be very low (ideally zero). A low internal resistance ensures that even if the load draws a high current, the voltage across the terminals remains stable.

#### Why is a good voltage source a bad current source?

- If a voltage source is tasked with acting as a current source, it will fail to maintain a constant current. This is because:
  - Current through a load depends on both the load resistance and the fixed voltage of the source.
  - As the load resistance changes, the current will vary significantly, which is contrary to the behavior of a good current source.

### Current Source Characteristics:

- A good current source maintains a constant current through the load regardless of the voltage across its terminals.
- For this, the internal resistance of the current source should be very high (ideally infinite). High internal resistance ensures that the current remains stable even as the voltage across the load fluctuates.

#### Why is a good current source a bad voltage source?

- If a current source is tasked with acting as a voltage source, it will fail to maintain a constant voltage across its terminals. This is because:
  - The voltage across the load depends on the load resistance and the fixed current from the source.
  - As the load resistance changes, the voltage will vary significantly, which is contrary to the behavior of a good voltage source.

1. Good Voltage Source: Low internal resistance → Stable voltage but unstable current.
2. Good Current Source: High internal resistance → Stable current but unstable voltage.

This duality highlights the limitations of each type of source and the trade-offs in practical electrical systems.
