The term potentiometer can indeed be misleading because it is not a device for directly measuring anything like a voltmeter or an ammeter. Instead, a potentiometer is a variable resistor used to adjust or divide voltage in a circuit. Here’s an explanation of the paradox and the historical context:

### Why Is It Called a Potentiometer?

1. Historical Origin:
   - The term "potentiometer" originally referred to an instrument used to measure electrical potential (voltage) in the 19th century.
   - Early potentiometers were complex devices used to compare an unknown voltage with a known reference voltage in a balanced circuit, effectively measuring voltage indirectly.

2. Modern Use as a Component:
   - Over time, the term "potentiometer" began to describe a simpler device derived from this principle—a variable resistor with three terminals.
   - In its modern use, it is no longer a measuring instrument but a voltage divider or variable resistor.

3. Name Retained Despite Function Change:
   - The term "potentiometer" was retained even as its purpose shifted from measurement to control because its structure and function were conceptually linked to the original potentiometers.

### How It Works in Modern Circuits
- A potentiometer has three terminals: two connected to the ends of a resistive track and one connected to a movable wiper.
- By adjusting the position of the wiper, the potentiometer divides voltage along the resistive track, allowing for precise control of voltage or current in a circuit.
- While it doesn’t measure anything, it controls or adjusts electrical quantities, which can indirectly influence measurement or performance.

### Explaining the Paradox

The paradox arises because the name "potentiometer" suggests a measuring function like other "-meter" devices. However:
1. The name is a historical artifact from its origins as a measuring instrument for electrical potential.
2. In modern usage, it’s not a meter but a variable resistor or voltage divider, making the name somewhat misleading.

### Summary
A potentiometer doesn’t measure anything in its modern usage; it adjusts or divides voltage. The term is a historical carryover from its original function as a voltage-measuring device, explaining the apparent paradox. Its name persists due to tradition and its conceptual link to controlling electrical potential.
