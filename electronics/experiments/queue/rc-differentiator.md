In Tinkercad, you can design a simple experiment to create and observe an RC Differentiator Circuit. This circuit will produce a voltage output that represents the rate of change of the input signal, effectively “differentiating” it. Here’s a step-by-step guide to building and testing this in Tinkercad:

### Components

1. Resistor: 1 kΩ
2. Capacitor: 100 nF
3. Function Generator: To provide an AC square wave signal (simulated using Tinkercad’s voltage source)
4. Oscilloscope: To observe the input and output waveforms (Tinkercad's multimeter can measure voltages, but you can simulate observing the waveforms by using Tinkercad's time-based voltage display)
5. Breadboard and Connecting Wires

### Steps

1. Set Up the Breadboard:
   - Place a resistor (1 kΩ) and a capacitor (100 nF) on the breadboard to form an RC series circuit.

2. Create the RC Differentiator:
   - Connect one end of the resistor to the positive terminal of the function generator (voltage source).
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to the positive end of the capacitor.
   - Connect the other end of the capacitor to the ground (negative terminal) of the function generator. This arrangement places the resistor in series with the input signal, with the capacitor connected to ground.

3. Observe the Output Across the Resistor:
   - Place a probe (or connect a multimeter in Tinkercad) across the resistor to observe the differentiated output.

4. Set Up the Function Generator:
   - Set the function generator to produce a square wave with a low frequency, such as 100 Hz, and a peak voltage of 5V.
   - The square wave will serve as the input signal for the differentiator.

5. Run the Simulation and Observe Output:
   - Start the simulation in Tinkercad.
   - Observe the voltage across the resistor. You should see sharp voltage spikes at the transitions of the square wave input (when it changes from low to high and high to low).
   - These spikes are the result of the differentiator circuit, showing the changes in the input signal’s slope.

### Results
- The output across the resistor will show spikes whenever the input square wave transitions. These spikes represent the differentiation of the input signal, as the circuit responds to rapid changes in the input voltage.
- When the input is steady (at the high or low level of the square wave), the output will remain close to zero, as there is no change in the input signal at those points.

- An RC Differentiator circuit generates an output signal that highlights changes in the input signal.
- In this setup, the differentiator circuit produces voltage spikes in response to the edges of the square wave, demonstrating its ability to differentiate a signal.

This experiment in Tinkercad provides a hands-on demonstration of how RC differentiator circuits respond to changing input signals, emphasizing their use in edge detection and pulse generation.
