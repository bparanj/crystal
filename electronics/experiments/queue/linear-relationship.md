linear

A linear relationship means that two quantities change at a constant rate relative to each other. In a graph, this relationship appears as a straight line. It can be expressed with the equation:

\[
y = mx + b
\]

Where:
- \( y \) and \( x \) are the two variables.
- \( m \) is the slope (rate of change).
- \( b \) is the y-intercept (starting value when \( x = 0 \)).

a linear relationship means that as one variable increases or decreases, the other does so in a steady, predictable way.

To plot linear and non-linear relationships involving a resistor and a diode, you can design simple experiments with varying voltage inputs and measure the resulting current. Here are two experiments:

### 1. Linear Relationship (Resistor: Ohm’s Law Experiment)

- Objective:

Demonstrate a linear relationship between voltage and current across a resistor.

- Setup:

Connect a resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ) in series with a variable DC power supply.

- Procedure:

  1. Vary the power supply voltage incrementally (e.g., 1V, 2V, 3V up to 10V).
  2. Measure the current through the resistor at each voltage.
  3. Plot Voltage (V) on the x-axis and Current (I) on the y-axis.

Result: A straight line, showing a linear relationship \( I = \frac{V}{R} \), where the slope represents the inverse of the resistor’s value.

### 2. Non-Linear Relationship (Diode: I-V Characteristic Experiment)

Demonstrate a non-linear relationship between voltage and current across a diode.

- Setup:

Connect a diode in series with a small resistor (e.g., 100Ω) and a variable DC power supply.

- Procedure:

  1. Gradually increase the voltage in small steps (e.g., 0.1V increments) up to around 1V, then in 0.2V increments up to 2V or 3V.
  2. Measure the current through the diode at each voltage step.
  3. Plot Voltage (V) on the x-axis and Current (I) on the y-axis.

Result: A non-linear, exponential curve. At low voltages, current remains nearly zero (cutoff region); once the threshold (around 0.7V for silicon) is crossed, current rises rapidly.

These experiments show:

- Resistor: A linear relationship following Ohm’s Law.
- Diode: A non-linear relationship due to its exponential response in the forward bias region.
