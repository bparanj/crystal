To obtain a current by applying a voltage across a resistor, follow Ohm's Law:

### Ohm's Law
\[ I = \frac{V}{R} \]

Where:
- \( I \) is the current (in amperes, A),
- \( V \) is the voltage (in volts, V),
- \( R \) is the resistance (in ohms, Ω).

### Steps
1. Determine the Voltage (V): Set or measure the voltage across the resistor.
2. Know the Resistance (R): Identify the resistor's resistance value.
3. Calculate the Current (I): Use the formula \( I = \frac{V}{R} \).

### Example
- Voltage (\( V \)): 5 V
- Resistance (\( R \)): 1 kΩ (1000 Ω)

\[
I = \frac{5}{1000} = 0.005 \, \text{A} \, \text{(5 mA)}
\]

The current through the resistor is 5 milliamperes.

### Key Points
- Ensure the resistor can handle the power dissipation \( P = V \cdot I \) safely.
- Use appropriate measurement tools to confirm your setup.
