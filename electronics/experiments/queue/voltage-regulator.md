Yes, you can design a simple experiment in Tinkercad to demonstrate the voltage regulation properties of a Zener diode. 

### Objective

Show how a Zener diode can regulate voltage by clamping it to a specific value in reverse bias, commonly used in voltage regulation applications.

### Components

1. DC Power Supply - 0-15V adjustable (to simulate varying input voltage)
2. Zener Diode - 5.1V Zener diode (or any available in Tinkercad, in reverse bias)
3. Resistor (R) - 470Ω (to limit current and protect the Zener diode)
4. Voltmeter - To measure the output voltage across the Zener diode
5. Breadboard - For connecting components

### Setup

1. Power Supply:

Connect the adjustable DC power supply to the breadboard, with the positive terminal connected to one end of the resistor.

2. Zener Diode Placement:
   - Place the Zener diode in reverse bias across the power supply output, after the resistor.
   - Connect the cathode (marked end) of the Zener diode to the positive terminal of the power supply (through the resistor) and the anode to the ground (negative terminal) of the power supply.

3. Voltmeter:

Connect the voltmeter across the Zener diode (across the cathode and anode) to measure the output voltage.

### Procedure

1. Set Low Input Voltage:
   - Start with the DC power supply set to a low voltage (e.g., 3V).
   - Observe the voltmeter reading across the Zener diode. The voltage across the Zener diode should be close to the input voltage because it hasn’t reached the Zener breakdown voltage yet.

2. Increase Input Voltage:
   - Gradually increase the DC power supply voltage. Once the input voltage exceeds the Zener diode's breakdown voltage (5.1V for a 5.1V Zener), the voltage across the Zener diode will stabilize close to its breakdown voltage.
   - Continue to increase the input voltage up to 10-12V. The Zener diode should clamp the output voltage close to its breakdown voltage, demonstrating voltage regulation.

### Results

- Below Zener Breakdown Voltage: When the input voltage is below the breakdown voltage, the voltage across the Zener diode will match the input voltage.
- At and Above Zener Breakdown Voltage: Once the input voltage exceeds the Zener breakdown voltage, the voltage across the Zener diode will stabilize around its breakdown voltage (e.g., 5.1V), regardless of further increases in input voltage.

This experiment demonstrates how a Zener diode can act as a voltage regulator in reverse bias by clamping the output voltage to a specific, stable value, providing simple voltage regulation.
