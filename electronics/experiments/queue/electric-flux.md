Electric flux is a measure of the electric field passing through a given surface. It represents the quantity of electric field lines penetrating that surface, providing insight into the field's strength and orientation in relation to the surface area.

### Key Concepts:

1. Electric Flux (Φ): It is calculated by multiplying the electric field (E) by the area (A) of the surface through which the field lines pass and considering the angle (θ) between the field lines and the perpendicular (normal) to the surface.
   - Formula: \(\Phi = E \cdot A \cdot \cos(\theta)\)
   - Here, \(E\) is the electric field strength, \(A\) is the area, and \(\theta\) is the angle between the electric field and the surface normal.

2. Units: Electric flux is measured in newton meters squared per coulomb (N·m²/C).

3. Closed Surface and Gauss's Law:
   - For a closed surface (like a sphere around a charge), the electric flux is proportional to the charge inside that surface.
   - Gauss's Law states that the total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by the permittivity of free space \((ε_0)\): \(\Phi = \frac{Q}{ε_0}\).

Electric flux helps visualize how electric fields interact with surfaces. Higher flux indicates a stronger or more concentrated electric field passing through the surface. If the field is perpendicular to the surface, the flux is maximized. When parallel, the flux is zero because no field lines pass through.

### Applications:

Electric flux is essential in electrostatics and is used in various fields, such as:
- Electric field calculations in charged enclosures.
- Capacitor design, where understanding electric flux helps in storing electric energy.

In essence, electric flux provides a way to quantify the "flow" of the electric field through a surface, helping analyze and design electric field-related phenomena.
