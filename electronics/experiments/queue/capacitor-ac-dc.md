The paradox of a nonconducting dielectric material between capacitor plates seemingly allowing AC current to pass is explained by the physics of capacitors and how they interact with alternating current (AC). Hereâ€™s the detailed explanation:

### How a Capacitor Passes AC with a Nonconducting Dielectric

1. Electric Field Interaction:
   - The dielectric between the capacitor plates is an insulator, so no physical charge flows through it.
   - However, when AC voltage is applied, the electric field across the plates alternates, causing the charges on the plates to oscillate in response to the changing field.

2. Displacement Current:
   - Although no charge physically flows through the dielectric, the oscillating electric field creates a displacement current in the circuit.
   - This displacement current arises due to the changing electric field and is mathematically equivalent to real current in the circuit.

3. Charging and Discharging of the Plates:
   - With AC voltage, the capacitor alternates between charging and discharging as the polarity of the voltage reverses.
   - This results in a flow of electrons in the external circuit, which is observed as AC current.

### Why It Blocks DC Current
- In contrast, DC voltage creates a steady electric field in the capacitor. Once the capacitor is fully charged, the electric field stabilizes, and no further current flows through the circuit. The nonconducting dielectric prevents any physical flow of charge, so the circuit becomes an open circuit for DC.

### Insights
- AC "Passes" Through the Capacitor: The current observed in the circuit is due to the oscillation of charge on the plates and the displacement current in the dielectric, not a physical flow of charge through the dielectric.
- DC Is Blocked: The nonconducting dielectric prevents continuous charge flow, which is why the capacitor blocks DC once charged.

The capacitor with a nonconducting dielectric passes AC current due to the oscillation of charges on the plates and the displacement current in the dielectric, even though no physical charge flows through the insulating material. This apparent paradox is resolved by understanding the role of the electric field and the time-varying nature of AC.
