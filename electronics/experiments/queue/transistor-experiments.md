Here are three simple experiments designed to demonstrate the basics of transistors,  their switching and amplification properties:

- Is this experiment already in the Tinkercad simulation and covered in the current experiment?

### 1. Experiment 1: Transistor as a Switch

Objective: 

Demonstrate how a transistor can be used as a switch to control a LED.

Materials:

- NPN transistor (e.g., 2N2222)
- Resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ for the base, 220 Ω for the LED)
- LED or small light bulb
- Battery (e.g., 9V)
- Switch
- Wires for connections

Set Up the Circuit:

   - Connect the collector of the NPN transistor to the positive terminal of the battery through the LED.
   - Connect the emitter directly to the negative terminal of the battery.
   - Connect the base of the transistor to the positive terminal of the battery through the 1 kΩ resistor.
   - Place the switch in series with the base resistor.

Operation:

   - When the switch is open, no current flows to the base of the transistor, so the LED remains off.
   - When the switch is closed, a small current flows into the base, allowing a larger current to flow from the collector to the emitter, lighting up the LED.

   - This experiment shows how a small current at the base of the transistor can control a larger current flowing through the collector-emitter path, effectively acting as a switch.

### 2. Experiment 2: Transistor as an Amplifier

Objective: 

Demonstrate the amplification property of a transistor by amplifying a small audio signal.

Materials:

- NPN transistor (e.g., 2N3904)
- Resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ for the collector, 10 kΩ for the base)
- Capacitor (e.g., 10 µF)
- Small speaker or headphone
- Battery (e.g., 9V)
- Audio source (e.g., a phone with an audio jack)
- Wires for connections

Procedure:

1. Set Up the Circuit:

   - Connect the collector of the transistor to the positive terminal of the battery through the 1 kΩ resistor.
   - Connect the emitter directly to the negative terminal of the battery.
   - Connect the base of the transistor to the audio signal source (e.g., the headphone output of a phone) through the 10 kΩ resistor and the capacitor (the capacitor blocks any DC component).
   - Connect the speaker between the collector of the transistor and the positive terminal of the battery.

2. Operation:
   - Play a low-volume audio signal from the phone. The audio signal will modulate the base current of the transistor.
   - The transistor amplifies the audio signal, driving the speaker with a larger current than the original audio source could provide.

   This experiment shows how a transistor can amplify a small input signal (audio from the phone) into a larger output signal (enough to drive the speaker), demonstrating its use as an amplifier.

### 3. Experiment 3: Transistor as an Oscillator

Objective: 

Demonstrate how a transistor can be used to generate a periodic signal, such as a square wave.

Materials:

- NPN transistor (e.g., 2N2222)
- Two resistors (e.g., 10 kΩ and 1 kΩ)
- Two capacitors (e.g., 100 µF and 10 µF)
- Battery (e.g., 9V)
- LED or small speaker (to observe the oscillation)
- Wires for connections

Procedure:

1. Set Up the Circuit:

   - Connect the collector of the transistor to the positive terminal of the battery through the 1 kΩ resistor.
   - Connect the emitter directly to the negative terminal of the battery.
   - Connect the base of the transistor to the junction of the two capacitors (one connected to the collector and one to the emitter).
   - Connect the LED (or speaker) in series with the collector.

2. Operation:

   - The circuit should start oscillating as the capacitors charge and discharge through the transistor. The LED will blink, or the speaker will emit a sound corresponding to the oscillation frequency.

This experiment demonstrates the transistor’s ability to work in a feedback loop to generate a periodic signal (oscillation). The capacitors and resistors determine the frequency of the oscillation, illustrating the transistor's role in generating oscillating signals for applications like clocks and signal generators.

### Summary:

Experiment 1: 

Shows how a transistor can act as a switch, controlling a larger current with a smaller one.

Experiment 2: 

Demonstrates the amplification property of a transistor, turning a small audio signal into a larger one.

Experiment 3: 

Illustrates the use of a transistor in an oscillator circuit, generating periodic signals.

These experiments provide practical demonstrations of the basic functions of a transistor, switching, amplification, and oscillation.
