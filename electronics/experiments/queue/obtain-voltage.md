Obtaining a voltage by passing a current through a resistor is based on Ohm's Law, which states:

\[
V = I \times R
\]

Where:
- \( V \) = Voltage across the resistor (Volts, V)
- \( I \) = Current through the resistor (Amperes, A)
- \( R \) = Resistance of the resistor (Ohms, Î©)

When a current \( I \) flows through a resistor \( R \), a voltage drop \( V \) develops across the resistor. This voltage is proportional to the product of the current and the resistance.

### How It Works:

1. Current Source: A controlled current flows through the resistor.
2. Resistor: The resistor creates opposition to the current, leading to a voltage drop across its terminals.
3. Resulting Voltage: The voltage drop can be measured and used in the circuit.

### Example

If a resistor \( R = 10 \, \Omega \) carries a current \( I = 2 \, \text{A} \), then the voltage across it is:
\[
V = I \times R = 2 \times 10 = 20 \, \text{V}
\]

### Applications:

1. Voltage Dividers:
   - Resistors in series create specific voltage levels proportional to the current flowing through them.
2. Signal Conditioning:
   - In sensors, current flow through a resistor produces a measurable voltage.
3. Shunt Resistors:
   - Low-value resistors create small voltage drops to measure current without significant energy loss.

### Insight:

The polarity of the voltage depends on the current direction. Voltage appears positive on the terminal where current enters the resistor.
