### Voltage Limiting Using a Parallel Diode

A parallel diode connected across a load limits voltage by clamping the voltage to the diode’s forward voltage drop (\(V_f\)). This configuration is commonly used for voltage clamping or overvoltage protection in circuits.

### Concepts:

1. Clamping Behavior:
   - When the input voltage exceeds the diode’s forward voltage (\(V_f\)), the diode conducts and limits the voltage across the load to approximately \(V_f\).
   - For reverse bias, the diode does not conduct, leaving the load unaffected.

2. Forward Voltage Drop:
   - A silicon diode limits the voltage to \( \approx 0.7V \).
   - A Schottky diode limits the voltage to \( \approx 0.3V \).

3. Applications:
   - Protecting sensitive components from overvoltage.
   - Stabilizing voltage levels in low-voltage circuits.

### Experiment

#### Components:
1. AC voltage source (\( V_{peak} = 5V, f = 50Hz \)).
2. Diode (e.g., 1N4148 or Schottky diode).
3. Resistor (Load) (\( R = 1k\Omega \)).
4. Oscilloscope (to observe the waveform).
5. Breadboard and wires.

### Setup:

1. Parallel Diode:
   - Connect one terminal of the AC voltage source to the resistor (\( R \)).
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to ground.
   - Place the diode in parallel with the resistor:
     - Anode connected to the ground.
     - Cathode connected to the input side of the resistor.

2. Oscilloscope Connections:
   - Channel 1: Across the AC voltage source to observe the input waveform.
   - Channel 2: Across the resistor to observe the output waveform.

### Steps:

1. Set Input Signal:
   - Configure the AC voltage source to produce a sine wave:
     - Peak voltage: \( 5V \)
     - Frequency: \( 50Hz \).

2. Observe Input Waveform:
   - Monitor the input sine wave on Channel 1 of the oscilloscope.

3. Observe Output Waveform:
   - Monitor the voltage across the resistor on Channel 2 of the oscilloscope.

4. Experiment with Diode Types:
   - Replace the silicon diode with a Schottky diode and observe the effect on the output waveform.

### Observations:

1. Voltage Clamping:
   - During the positive half-cycle, when the input voltage exceeds \( V_f \), the diode conducts, clamping the voltage across the load to:
     \[
     V_{out} \approx V_f
     \]

2. Negative Half-Cycle:
   - During the negative half-cycle, the diode remains reverse-biased, and the output follows the input voltage.

3. Effect of Diode Type:
   - A silicon diode clamps at \( V_f \approx 0.7V \), while a Schottky diode clamps at \( V_f \approx 0.3V \).

### Insights:

1. Overvoltage Protection:
   - This configuration protects components by limiting excessive positive voltages.

2. Dual-Diode Configuration:
   - Adding a second diode in reverse polarity limits both positive and negative voltages.

3. Applications:
   - Used in signal conditioning, power supplies, and circuits requiring precise voltage limits.

you can visualize the clamping effect of the parallel diode and experiment with different diodes to observe how they impact the voltage-limiting behavior.
