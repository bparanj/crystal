A positive clipper circuit allows only the negative portion of an AC signal to pass through by clipping (cutting off) the positive part at a certain voltage level. You can build a simple positive clipper circuit in Tinkercad to demonstrate this concept.

### Components:

1. AC Voltage Source: To supply an AC signal.
2. Diode: Standard diode (e.g., 1N4148 or 1N4007).
3. Resistor: 1 kΩ resistor.
4. Oscilloscope: To observe the input and output waveforms.
5. DC Power Supply (optional): To set a specific clipping voltage if needed.

### Setup:

1. Connect the AC Source:
   - Connect one terminal of the AC source to the resistor (1 kΩ).
   - Connect the other terminal of the AC source to ground.

2. Add the Diode for Clipping:
   - Place the diode in parallel with the AC source, oriented so that its anode is connected to the input signal (after the resistor) and its cathode is connected to ground.
   - This orientation allows the diode to conduct only during the positive half of the AC cycle, clipping the positive part of the waveform.

3. Set Up the Oscilloscope:
   - Connect the oscilloscope probes to observe the input and output voltages.
   - Place the first probe at the input (before the resistor) and the second probe at the output (after the diode).

### Optional: Adding a DC Power Supply for Custom Clipping Voltage

   - If you want to clip the signal at a voltage other than 0V, connect a small DC power supply in series with the diode (between the anode of the diode and ground). This will set the clipping level at the DC voltage value.

### Steps:

1. Run the Simulation:
   - Start the simulation in Tinkercad.
   - Set the AC source to a small amplitude, like 5V peak-to-peak, and a moderate frequency (e.g., 50 Hz) to easily observe the waveform.

2. Observe the Oscilloscope Readings:
   - Observe the input waveform on one channel of the oscilloscope and the output waveform on the other.
   - Expected Outcome: On the output waveform, you should see the positive portion of the AC signal clipped off at approximately 0V (or the level of the DC offset if added). The negative portion of the AC signal should pass through unaffected.

3. Adjusting Clipping Level (Optional):
   - If you have included the DC power supply in series with the diode, adjust its voltage to see how the clipping level changes. Increasing the DC voltage will clip the signal at a higher positive level.

Diode Action:

The diode only allows current to flow when the AC voltage exceeds its forward voltage (around 0.7V for a silicon diode). During the positive half-cycle, the diode conducts and “clips” the signal by grounding it, limiting it to roughly 0V (or the DC offset).

Clipping Effect:

The positive portion of the AC signal is clipped, while the negative portion remains unaffected.

This simple experiment shows how a positive clipper circuit can limit the voltage of an AC signal, making it useful for applications where you need to protect circuits from high positive voltages or create modified AC waveforms.
