Image 1 shows the negative terminal. You can see the negative sign in black. All the dots in the horizontal line at the top shown with green circles around the dots are connected together. They all provide connection for negative terminal. This is called the power rail.

Image 2 shows the positive terminal. You can see the positive sign in red. All the dots in this horizontal line are shown with green circles round them. These dots are connected together. They all provide connection for positive terminal. This is called the power rail.

Image 3 shows the negative terminal at the bottom of the breadboard. It is similar to the negative terminal at the top.

Image 4 shows the positive terminal at the bottom of the breadboard. It is similar to the positive terminal at the top.

Image 5 shows the dots are connected vertically. They are labeled f, g, h, i and j. They are connected together. Any component that are connected to this columwise dots will be connected to each other. The columns are numbered from 1 to 30. Each column provides a way to connect components. Each of those columns are separated, meaning they don't connect row wise.

Image 6 shows another vertical group of dots.

Image 7 shows the section that is similar to the section above. They are labeled a, b, c, d and e. This section is not connected to the section above. The numbers are the same 1 through 30 as the section above. They also provide connections only columnwise. They are isolated rowwise.

Image 8 shows another vertical group of dots for this section of the breadboard.
