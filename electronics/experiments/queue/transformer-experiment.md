A simple experiment to illustrate the concept of a transformer and how it transfers energy between circuits without direct contact.

### Objective:

To demonstrate electromagnetic induction in a transformer, showing that electrical energy can be transferred between two circuits without direct connection.

### Materials Needed:

- Two coils of wire (with approximately 50-100 turns each)
- An iron core (like a large iron nail or a small iron rod)
- An AC power source or function generator
- A small LED or low-wattage light bulb
- A multimeter to measure voltage
- Connecting wires
- Breadboard

### Procedure:

1. Create the Primary and Secondary Coils:

Wind two separate coils of wire around the iron core. One coil will act as the primary winding, and the other as the secondary winding. Make sure the coils are close together but not touching, and that they are wound in the same direction to ensure proper inductive coupling.

2. Connect the Primary Coil to the AC Power Source:

Connect the primary coil to the AC power source or function generator. Ensure the connections are secure and that the function generator is set to output a low AC voltage (e.g., 1-5V) at a moderate frequency (e.g., 50-60 Hz).

3. Connect the Secondary Coil to the Load:

Connect the ends of the secondary coil to a small LED or low-wattage light bulb. This will act as the load that receives energy from the transformer through electromagnetic induction.

4. Observe the LED or Bulb:

Turn on the AC power source or function generator. Observe that the LED or light bulb connected to the secondary coil lights up. This demonstrates that energy is being transferred from the primary coil to the secondary coil through the iron core via electromagnetic induction.

5. Measure the Voltage:

Use a multimeter to measure the voltage across the secondary coil. Compare it to the voltage across the primary coil. Depending on the number of turns in each coil, you should observe that the secondary voltage is either higher (step-up transformer) or lower (step-down transformer) than the primary voltage.

This experiment illustrates how a transformer transfers electrical energy between two circuits without direct electrical contact. The AC current flowing through the primary coil generates a changing magnetic field around the iron core. This changing magnetic field induces a voltage in the secondary coil, which lights up the LED or bulb. The amount of voltage induced in the secondary coil depends on the ratio of the number of turns between the primary and secondary coils, demonstrating the basic principle of how transformers work to step up or step down voltage levels while maintaining electrical isolation between circuits.
