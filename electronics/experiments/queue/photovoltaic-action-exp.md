Can this be run in Tinkercad?

### Objective:

To demonstrate how sunlight can be converted directly into electrical energy using a solar cell.

### Materials:

- A small solar cell (like those found in solar-powered calculators or small solar panels)
- A multimeter set to measure voltage (in volts)
- A small LED or low-power device (optional, to show the power generation)
- A light source (sunlight or a strong lamp)
- Connecting wires

### Procedure:

1. Set Up the Solar Cell:

   - Connect the positive and negative terminals of the solar cell to the corresponding terminals of the multimeter using the connecting wires. Set the multimeter to measure voltage.

2. Expose the Solar Cell to Light:

   - Place the solar cell under a light source, such as sunlight or a strong lamp. Ensure that the light is shining directly on the surface of the solar cell.

3. Observe the Voltage:

   - Look at the multimeter reading. You should see a voltage appear on the multimeter, indicating that the solar cell is generating electricity from the light.

4. Vary the Light Intensity:

   - Move the light source closer or farther away from the solar cell or change the light's intensity. Observe how the voltage reading on the multimeter changes with the light intensity. The voltage should increase with stronger light and decrease with weaker light.

5. Power a Small Device (Optional):

   - Disconnect the multimeter and connect the solar cell directly to a small LED or another low-power device. Expose the solar cell to light, and observe that the LED lights up or the device operates, powered by the electricity generated through photovoltaic action.

This experiment demonstrates photovoltaic action, where light energy is converted directly into electrical energy by the solar cell. When photons from the light source strike the semiconductor material in the solar cell, they excite electrons, freeing them from their atomic bonds and creating an electric current. The multimeter reading shows the voltage generated, and the optional LED demonstrates that this electrical energy can be used to power devices. This simple setup provides a clear illustration of how solar cells harness light to generate electricity.

Experiment: Demonstrating Photovoltaic Effect with a DIY Solar Cell

Materials:

1. A small solar cell (can be purchased from an electronics store or salvaged from a solar-powered garden light)
2. A multimeter
3. A bright light source (sunlight or a strong lamp)
4. A piece of cardboard or dark paper
5. Optional: A small motor or LED

Setup and procedure:

1. Connect the multimeter to the solar cell. Set the multimeter to measure voltage (DC).

2. Place the solar cell in a well-lit area, either in direct sunlight or under a bright lamp.

3. Record the voltage reading on the multimeter.

4. Gradually cover portions of the solar cell with the cardboard or dark paper, recording the voltage at each step.

5. Fully uncover the cell and note the voltage again.

6. If using a motor or LED, connect it to the solar cell and observe its operation under different lighting conditions.

7. Try varying the distance between the light source and the solar cell, recording voltage changes.

8. If possible, use different colored filters or lights to observe any changes in output.

Expected results:

- When fully exposed to light, the solar cell should produce a measurable voltage.
- As you cover portions of the cell, the voltage should decrease.
- Changing the distance from the light source should affect the voltage output.
- If connected, the motor's speed or LED's brightness should change with light intensity.
- Different colors of light might produce varying outputs.

This experiment demonstrates the basic principle of photovoltaic action. The solar cell contains semiconductor materials ( silicon) that generate an electric current when exposed to light. Photons from the light source excite electrons in the semiconductor, creating electron-hole pairs. The cell's internal structure separates these charges, producing a voltage across its terminals.

The experiment shows how:

1. Light intensity affects voltage output
2. The active area of the cell impacts its performance
3. Different wavelengths of light may produce different outputs

This simple setup illustrates the fundamental mechanism behind solar panels used for renewable energy generation.

Variations:

- Compare the output of multiple small solar cells connected in series vs. parallel
- Measure both voltage and current to calculate power output under different conditions
- Use a data logger for continuous measurement over a day to observe the effect of changing natural light
