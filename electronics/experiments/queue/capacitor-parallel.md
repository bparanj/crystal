What happens when capacitor is connected in parallel?

When capacitors are connected in parallel, their total or equivalent capacitance increases. This setup impacts the circuit’s behavior in several important ways:

Here’s how to design an experiment in Tinkercad to demonstrate the behavior of two capacitors connected in parallel.

### Objective
To show that when two capacitors are connected in parallel, the total capacitance is the sum of the individual capacitances, allowing the circuit to store more energy and demonstrating a longer charge/discharge time in an RC circuit.

### Components Needed in Tinkercad
1. Breadboard
2. DC Power Supply (e.g., 9V battery)
3. Two capacitors (e.g., 100 µF each)
4. Resistor (1 kΩ) to control current flow
5. LED to observe discharge behavior
6. Switch to control charging and discharging
7. Multimeter (optional) to measure voltage across the capacitors

### Steps

1. Set Up the Power Supply:
   - Place the 9V battery on the breadboard.
   - Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive rail of the breadboard.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative rail of the breadboard.

2. Connect Two Capacitors in Parallel:
   - Place the two capacitors on the breadboard.
   - Connect the positive terminals of both capacitors to the positive rail of the breadboard.
   - Connect the negative terminals of both capacitors to a common row on the breadboard, and connect this row to the negative rail. This creates a parallel connection between the two capacitors.

3. Add a Resistor and LED in Series:
   - Place a 1 kΩ resistor on the breadboard. Connect one end of the resistor to the positive rail where the capacitors are connected.
   - Connect the anode (longer leg) of the LED to the other end of the resistor.
   - Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of the LED to the negative rail of the breadboard. This completes the RC circuit, with the LED acting as a visual indicator of the charge and discharge behavior.

4. Add a Switch to Control Charging and Discharging:
   - Place a switch between the positive rail and the capacitors to control when the capacitors are connected to the battery, allowing you to charge or discharge them.

5. Attach a Multimeter (Optional):
   - Set up a multimeter in Tinkercad to measure the voltage across the capacitors. This will help you monitor the charging and discharging more precisely.

6. Run the Simulation (Charging Cycle):
   - Close the switch to connect the capacitors to the battery, allowing them to start charging.
   - Observe the LED: as the capacitors charge, current flows through the LED, causing it to light up initially and then dim as the capacitors reach full charge.
   - You should see the voltage reading on the multimeter gradually increase as the capacitors charge.

7. Run the Simulation (Discharging Cycle):
   - Open the switch to disconnect the capacitors from the battery.
   - The capacitors will begin to discharge through the resistor and LED, causing the LED to light up again briefly and then gradually dim as the capacitors discharge.
   - Note that the discharge time is longer compared to a single capacitor, as the two capacitors in parallel provide more stored charge.

### Explanation of Parallel Capacitance

When capacitors are connected in parallel, their total capacitance \( C_{\text{total}} \) is the sum of the individual capacitances:
\[
C_{\text{total}} = C_1 + C_2
\]
For two 100 µF capacitors in parallel, the total capacitance would be:
\[
C_{\text{total}} = 100 \, \mu\text{F} + 100 \, \mu\text{F} = 200 \, \mu\text{F}
\]
This higher total capacitance means that the capacitors can store more energy for the same applied voltage and will take longer to charge and discharge.

### Key Observations
- Increased Total Capacitance: The two capacitors in parallel result in a total capacitance that is the sum of the individual capacitors, meaning the circuit can store more energy.
- Longer Charging and Discharging Times: Due to the increased capacitance, the capacitors charge and discharge more slowly compared to a single capacitor of 100 µF.

### Conclusion
This experiment demonstrates that connecting capacitors in parallel increases the total capacitance, allowing the circuit to store more energy and resulting in a longer charge and discharge time. In practical circuits, parallel capacitors are used to increase total capacitance and to stabilize voltage in power supply circuits.

### 1. Increased Total Capacitance

   - When capacitors are connected in parallel, their capacitances add up. The total capacitance \( C_{\text{total}} \) is given by:
     \[
     C_{\text{total}} = C_1 + C_2 + \dots + C_n
     \]
   - This means that the total capacitance is the sum of each capacitor’s individual capacitance. As a result, the circuit can store more charge overall.

### 2. Voltage Across Each Capacitor Remains the Same

   - In a parallel connection, each capacitor experiences the same voltage as the power supply. This is because each capacitor is directly connected across the supply terminals.
   - This is useful in applications where multiple capacitors are added to smooth voltage fluctuations or supply steady current without changing the voltage.

### 3. Increased Energy Storage Capacity

   - Because capacitance increases in parallel, the circuit can store more energy, which is helpful in applications requiring a steady current over time or in power supplies that need stable voltage even under load.
   - The total energy stored in capacitors in parallel is greater, following the formula:
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{2} C_{\text{total}} V^2
     \]
     where \( V \) is the voltage across the capacitors.

### Implications

   - Higher Capacitance for Energy Storage: Parallel capacitors are commonly used in power supply circuits to provide a large, stable current capacity, as this increases the total charge storage.
   - Stabilized Voltage Across Components: Since all capacitors share the same voltage, parallel capacitors help stabilize voltage across sensitive components.

Connecting capacitors in parallel increases the total capacitance, allowing for more charge storage at a given voltage, which is ideal for applications needing stable power and high energy storage capacity.

You can use Tinkercad to demonstrate the effect of connecting capacitors in parallel by observing how the total capacitance changes and how it affects the charging and discharging behavior. In this experiment, we’ll measure the charge and discharge time of capacitors connected in parallel compared to a single capacitor.

### Components:

1. DC Power Supply: 9V DC source.
2. Capacitors: Two capacitors with equal values, such as 10 µF each.
3. Resistor: 1 kΩ resistor (to control the charging and discharging rate).
4. Switch: To control the charging and discharging of the capacitors.
5. Multimeter: To measure the voltage across the capacitors.
6. Oscilloscope: (Optional) To observe voltage changes over time.

### Setup:

1. Single Capacitor Setup (Reference Measurement):
   - Connect one terminal of the DC power source to one end of the resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to the positive terminal of a single 10 µF capacitor.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the capacitor to the ground terminal of the power supply.
   - Place a switch in series with the capacitor to control charging and discharging.
   - Attach the multimeter across the capacitor to measure voltage.

2. Parallel Capacitor Setup:
   - Now, modify the circuit to include two capacitors in parallel:
     - Connect the positive terminal of the second capacitor to the positive terminal of the first capacitor.
     - Connect the negative terminal of the second capacitor to the negative terminal of the first capacitor (both capacitor negative terminals go to ground).
   - Keep the switch in the same position as before.
   - Attach the multimeter across both capacitors to measure the combined voltage.

### Steps:

1. Step 1: Charge a Single Capacitor:
   - Begin with the single capacitor setup.
   - Close the switch to allow the capacitor to charge.
   - Observe the voltage across the capacitor using the multimeter or oscilloscope.
   - Expected Outcome: The capacitor will charge up to the supply voltage (9V). Record the time taken for the capacitor to charge to approximately 63% of the full voltage (which corresponds to one time constant, \( \tau = RC \)).

2. Step 2: Charge Capacitors in Parallel:
   - Replace the single capacitor with the parallel capacitor setup (two capacitors in parallel).
   - Close the switch to allow the capacitors to charge.
   - Observe the voltage across the capacitors using the multimeter or oscilloscope.
   - Expected Outcome: The voltage across the parallel capacitors will also reach 9V, but the charging time will be longer compared to the single capacitor setup. This is because the total capacitance has increased, so the circuit can store more charge, making the charging process slower.

3. Step 3: Compare Discharge Times:
   - Open the switch to allow the capacitors to discharge through the resistor.
   - Observe the time it takes for the voltage across the capacitors to drop back down, and compare it to the time taken for the single capacitor to discharge.
   - Expected Outcome: The parallel capacitors will discharge more slowly than the single capacitor due to the increased total capacitance.

- Total Capacitance in Parallel: When capacitors are connected in parallel, their total capacitance is the sum of individual capacitances:
  \[
  C_{\text{total}} = C_1 + C_2
  \]
  For two 10 µF capacitors in parallel, the total capacitance becomes 20 µF, allowing the circuit to store more charge.
- Charging and Discharging Times: The increased capacitance in the parallel setup increases the time constant \( \tau = RC \), which leads to a longer charging and discharging time compared to a single capacitor.

This experiment allows you to visualize the impact of connecting capacitors in parallel, demonstrating how total capacitance increases, which leads to a slower charge/discharge rate and a higher charge storage capacity. This is useful in applications that need stable, long-lasting power, such as power supplies and energy storage systems.
