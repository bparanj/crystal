This experiment is commonly referred to as a "Transistor-Based Oscillator with Voltage Doubling" circuit. It can be broken down into:

1. Transistor-Based Oscillator: 

A simple oscillation circuit using a single NPN transistor, which is a common way to generate an AC signal from a DC source without using ICs. This type of circuit is sometimes referred to as a transistor relaxation oscillator or astable multivibrator (if configured as such), though it doesn’t use an IC or complex feedback network.

2. Voltage Doubler: 

The second part of the circuit is a voltage multiplier or voltage doubler, specifically a Cockcroft-Walton voltage doubler. This stage takes the oscillating AC signal from the transistor and doubles its peak voltage using a diode-capacitor network.

Therefore, the full experiment could be described as:

### Transistor-Based Oscillator with Cockcroft-Walton Voltage Doubler

This name highlights both the oscillation generation (via a transistor) and the voltage amplification (via a voltage doubler). The circuit demonstrates basic principles of AC generation from DC and voltage multiplication, often used in introductory electronics experiments to explore oscillation and voltage conversion.

To design a frequency generator that steps up a 9V DC source to approximately 20V AC or DC without using an IC, we can use a transistor-based oscillator circuit along with a voltage doubler. This setup generates an AC signal, and the voltage doubler will amplify the peak voltage.

### Experiment Setup in Tinkercad

1. Components Needed:
   - 9V DC power source (battery)
   - NPN Transistor (e.g., 2N2222)
   - Resistors (for biasing and setting frequency)
   - Capacitors (for timing and voltage multiplication)
   - Diodes (for voltage doubler circuit)
   - Inductor (optional, if available, to enhance oscillations)
   - Oscilloscope (to measure the output voltage)

2. Circuit Design:

   #### Step 1: Build a Transistor-Based Oscillator
   
   - Use an NPN transistor like the 2N2222 to create a basic oscillator.
   - Base Resistor: Connect a resistor (e.g., 10kΩ) between the base of the transistor and the positive terminal of the battery to provide biasing.
   - Feedback Capacitor: Place a capacitor (e.g., 100nF) between the collector and base to create the feedback loop necessary for oscillation.
   - Collector Resistor: Add a resistor (e.g., 1kΩ) between the collector and the positive battery terminal to limit current through the transistor.
   - Optional Inductor: If Tinkercad provides an inductor, place it in series with the collector to help create more stable oscillations.

   This setup should allow the transistor to oscillate, producing a square wave signal at the collector. The frequency depends on the values of the base resistor and feedback capacitor.

   #### Step 2: Build a Voltage Doubler Circuit
   
   - After the oscillator (at the collector), connect a voltage doubler circuit (two diodes and two capacitors).
   - Use two capacitors (e.g., 100μF each) and two diodes (e.g., 1N4148 or 1N4007) in a Cockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier arrangement:
     - Connect the first capacitor in series with the output from the transistor’s collector.
     - The first diode directs current flow to the second capacitor, which stores the doubled peak voltage.
   - This voltage doubler will output roughly twice the peak voltage of the AC signal from the transistor.

   #### Step 3: Measure with an Oscilloscope
   
   - Attach the oscilloscope probes across the output of the voltage doubler circuit to observe the stepped-up voltage waveform.
   - The oscilloscope should show a waveform with a peak voltage approximately twice the initial 9V input, giving you close to 20V DC (or pulsating DC if viewed as AC).

3. Operation:
   - Power the circuit with the 9V battery.
   - The transistor oscillator will generate an AC signal (square wave).
   - The voltage doubler circuit will amplify the peak voltage, producing approximately 20V DC at the output.

4. Tuning the Frequency:
   - By changing the values of the base resistor and feedback capacitor, you can adjust the oscillation frequency.
   - Lower resistance or capacitance values will increase the frequency, while higher values will decrease it.

### Observations

- The final output after the voltage doubler will be a pulsating DC waveform with a peak close to 20V.
- Although not a pure sine wave, this setup effectively shows voltage multiplication and frequency generation without using ICs.
- Tinkercad may have limitations with precise frequency and waveform shapes, but this experiment illustrates the principle of using transistors and passive components to generate and amplify AC-like signals.
