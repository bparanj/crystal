Here are three simple experiments designed to demonstrate Ohm's Law, which states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance between them.

### 1. Basic Verification of Ohm's Law

Demonstrate the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in a simple circuit.

Materials:

- Resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ)
- Battery (e.g., 9V)
- Ammeter (to measure current)
- Voltmeter (to measure voltage)
- Wires for connections

Procedure:

   - Connect the resistor in series with the battery.
   - Connect the ammeter in series with the resistor to measure the current.
   - Connect the voltmeter across the resistor to measure the voltage drop.

   - Measure the voltage across the resistor using the voltmeter.
   - Measure the current through the resistor using the ammeter.
   - Record the values of voltage (V) and current (I).

   - Use Ohm’s Law \( R = \frac{V}{I} \) to calculate the resistance.
   - Compare the calculated resistance with the known value of the resistor.

   - This experiment demonstrates Ohm’s Law by showing that the voltage across the resistor is proportional to the current through it, and the proportionality constant is the resistance.

### 2. Varying Voltage to Observe Changes in Current

Show how changing the voltage across a resistor affects the current, verifying Ohm’s Law.

Materials:

- Variable power supply (or a series of batteries with different voltages)
- Resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ)
- Ammeter
- Voltmeter
- Wires for connections

Procedure:

   - Connect the resistor in series with the variable power supply.
   - Connect the ammeter in series to measure the current.
   - Connect the voltmeter across the resistor to measure the voltage drop.

   - Start with a low voltage setting on the power supply. Measure and record the voltage across the resistor and the current through the circuit.
   - Gradually increase the voltage and record the corresponding current for each setting.

   - Plot a graph of the voltage (V) on the x-axis versus the current (I) on the y-axis.
   - The graph should show a straight line, indicating a linear relationship, which confirms Ohm's Law.

   - This experiment shows that as you increase the voltage, the current increases proportionally, confirming that \( V = IR \).

### 3 Varying Resistance to Observe Changes in Current

Demonstrate how changing the resistance in a circuit affects the current, in accordance with Ohm’s Law.

Materials:

- Resistor set with different values (e.g., 100Ω, 500Ω, 1 kΩ)
- Battery (e.g., 9V)
- Ammeter
- Voltmeter
- Wires for connections

Procedure:

   - Connect one of the resistors in series with the battery.
   - Connect the ammeter in series to measure the current.
   - Connect the voltmeter across the resistor to measure the voltage drop.

   - Measure the voltage and current with the first resistor (e.g., 100Ω).
   - Replace the resistor with a different value (e.g., 500Ω) and measure the voltage and current again.
   - Repeat with the third resistor (e.g., 1 kΩ).

   - For each resistor, calculate the expected current using \( I = \frac{V}{R} \) and compare it with the measured current.
   - Notice how the current decreases as the resistance increases, verifying the inverse relationship in Ohm’s Law.

   - This experiment demonstrates that for a constant voltage, increasing the resistance decreases the current, and decreasing the resistance increases the current, in accordance with Ohm’s Law.

- Experiment 1: Verifies the basic relationship of Ohm’s Law by directly measuring voltage and current.
- Experiment 2: Demonstrates how changing the voltage affects the current in a resistor, confirming the proportional relationship.
- Experiment 3: Shows the effect of changing resistance on current for a constant voltage, illustrating the inverse relationship described by Ohm’s Law.

These experiments demonstrates the principles behind Ohm's Law, helping to solidify understanding of the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.
