Design an experiment to demonstrate the EMF and back-EMF created when DC current starts and stops passing through an inductor using Tinkercad

Here's a step-by-step guide to design an experiment on Tinkercad to demonstrate EMF and back-EMF using an inductor:

### Components Needed:
1. Inductor (e.g., 10 mH)
2. Resistor (e.g., 220Î©)
3. LED (optional, for visual indication)
4. Switch
5. Battery (e.g., 9V)
6. Connecting wires

### Circuit Design:
1. **Power Supply and Switch**:
   - Connect the positive terminal of the battery to one terminal of the switch.
   - Connect the other terminal of the switch to one end of the resistor (R).

2. **Inductor and Resistor**:
   - Connect the other end of the resistor (R) to one end of the inductor (L).
   - Connect the other end of the inductor (L) back to the negative terminal of the battery.

3. **Optional LED**:
   - Connect the LED in parallel with the inductor (L) to observe the effect of EMF and back-EMF visually.

### Steps to Demonstrate EMF and Back-EMF:
1. **Closing the Switch (Charging Phase)**:
   - When you close the switch, current starts flowing through the circuit.
   - The inductor generates an EMF (electromotive force) opposing the change in current, causing a brief spike in voltage.
   - If an LED is connected, it will briefly light up due to this spike.

2. **Opening the Switch (Discharging Phase)**:
   - When you open the switch, the current flow stops abruptly.
   - The inductor generates a back-EMF to oppose the sudden change in current, causing a brief spike in voltage in the opposite direction.
   - If an LED is connected, it will briefly light up again due to this back-EMF.

### Tinkercad Simulation:
1. **Create a New Circuit**:
   - Open Tinkercad and start a new circuit project.
   - Place the battery, switch, resistor, inductor, and optional LED on the workspace.

2. **Connect Components**:
   - Use the wiring tool to connect the components as described above.

3. **Run the Simulation**:
   - Close the switch to observe the EMF during the charging phase.
   - Open the switch to observe the back-EMF during the discharging phase.

### Observations:
- **Charging Phase**: When the switch is closed, the inductor generates an EMF that opposes the increase in current, causing a brief voltage spike.
- **Discharging Phase**: When the switch is opened, the inductor generates a back-EMF that opposes the decrease in current, causing another brief voltage spike.

This experiment will help you visualize how EMF and back-EMF are generated when DC current starts and stops passing through an inductor. Have fun experimenting on Tinkercad!
