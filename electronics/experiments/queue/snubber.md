May not be that clear on Tinkercad

Yes, a snubber circuit is sometimes referred to as a "transient suppression circuit" or "spike suppression circuit." These terms all highlight the snubber circuit’s role in absorbing and dissipating energy spikes or transients to protect other components in the circuit.

you can implement a simple RC snubber circuit in Tinkercad to observe its basic function. However, Tinkercad's capabilities are limited and may not fully simulate the high-frequency switching transients where a snubber is most effective, but you can still get a sense of how it operates by setting up an RC snubber circuit across a switch or inductive load.

A snubber circuit is typically used to suppress voltage spikes across a switch or an inductive load, like a relay or motor, by absorbing energy and reducing electromagnetic interference (EMI). A basic RC snubber consists of a resistor and a capacitor in series, placed across the switch or load.

### Components:

1. DC Power Source: 12V DC power supply.
2. Switch: To control when the snubber circuit is engaged.
3. Inductive Load: An inductor (e.g., 10 mH) to simulate the inductive load, such as a motor or relay coil.
4. Resistor: 100 Ω resistor.
5. Capacitor: 0.1 µF capacitor.
6. Oscilloscope: To observe voltage spikes across the switch.

### Setup:

   - Connect the positive terminal of the DC power source to one terminal of the inductor.
   - Connect the other terminal of the inductor to one side of the switch.
   - Connect the other side of the switch to the ground.

   - Connect a 100 Ω resistor and a 0.1 µF capacitor in series.
   - Place this RC series combination across the switch, with one end connected to the side of the switch connected to the inductor and the other end connected to ground.
   - This setup allows the RC snubber to absorb the voltage spike generated when the switch opens.

   - Connect the oscilloscope probes across the switch to monitor voltage spikes that occur when the switch is opened.

### Steps:

   - Start the Tinkercad simulation.
   - Close the switch to allow current to flow through the inductor, building up magnetic energy.

   - Open the switch to interrupt the current flow through the inductor.
   - Expected Outcome: Without the snubber, you would typically see a sharp voltage spike across the switch due to the inductor’s stored energy. With the RC snubber in place, the voltage spike should be significantly reduced, as the snubber absorbs the excess energy.

   - Watch the oscilloscope to see how the RC snubber affects the voltage across the switch when it opens. The capacitor should absorb some of the energy, and the resistor dissipates it, smoothing out the spike.

When the switch opens, the inductor tries to maintain current flow, creating a high voltage spike. The RC snubber provides an alternate path for this energy, reducing the spike and preventing arcing across the switch.

The capacitor absorbs the energy from the spike, and the resistor dissipates it as heat, protecting the switch and other circuit components from damage.

### Limitations in Tinkercad:

While Tinkercad allows for the basic setup, it doesn’t simulate transient behaviors perfectly, so the voltage spike reduction may not be as pronounced as in a real circuit. In more advanced simulations or real circuits, snubbers are tuned specifically for high-speed switching events, and inductive kickback is much more apparent.

This setup still provides a foundation for understanding how snubbers work and how they protect components in circuits with inductive loads.
