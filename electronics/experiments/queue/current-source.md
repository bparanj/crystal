### Current Source with Variable Load (Simulated with a High Resistance Series Resistor)

Objective: Show that a good current source maintains constant current but variable voltage with changes in load.

Components:

- DC Power Source (e.g., 9V battery)
- High Resistance Resistor (e.g., 10 kΩ in series with the power source to simulate a current source)
- 3 Resistors with different values (e.g., 1 kΩ, 500 Ω, and 100 Ω)
- Multimeter (to measure voltage)

Steps:

1. Simulate a Current Source:

Connect the 9V battery to the breadboard, and place the 10 kΩ resistor in series with it to simulate a high internal resistance (which approximates a current source).

2. Connect a Load Resistor:

Start by connecting the 1 kΩ resistor as the load in series with the 10 kΩ resistor.

3. Measure Voltage and Current:

Measure the current through and the voltage across the load resistor.

4. Change the Load:

Replace the 1 kΩ resistor with the 500 Ω resistor and then the 100 Ω resistor, measuring voltage and current each time.

Results:

- The current through the circuit should remain nearly constant despite changes in load resistance, as the high series resistor limits current (good current source behavior).
- The voltage across the load resistor varies significantly with each load (poor voltage source behavior).

These experiments show:
- Voltage Source Experiment: A constant voltage but variable current, illustrating that a good voltage source is not a good current source.
- Current Source Experiment: A constant current but variable voltage, illustrating that a good current source is not a good voltage source.
