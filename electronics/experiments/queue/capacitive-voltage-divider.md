An equivalent experiment for demonstrating the concept of division or distribution of voltage with capacitance can be done using a capacitive voltage divider. This experiment shows how voltage divides across capacitors connected in series, which is analogous to the resistive voltage divider but operates on a different principle because capacitors behave differently in AC and DC circuits.

### Objective:

To demonstrate that in a series circuit, voltage divides across capacitors inversely to their capacitance values. A smaller capacitor receives a higher voltage drop than a larger capacitor.

### Components:

- 1 AC Power Source (e.g., 5V AC source, since capacitors block DC in steady state)
- 2 Capacitors with different values (e.g., 1 μF and 10 μF)
- Multimeter (to measure the voltage across each capacitor)
- Breadboard and Wires

### Steps:

1. Set Up the AC Power Supply:
   - Connect the positive terminal of the AC power source to the breadboard's positive rail.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the AC power source to the ground rail.

2. Connect the Capacitors in Series:
   - Connect the 1 μF capacitor in series with the 10 μF capacitor.
   - Connect one end of the 1 μF capacitor to the positive rail.
   - Connect the other end of the 10 μF capacitor to the ground rail.

3. Measure the Voltage Across Each Capacitor:
   - Use the multimeter in Tinkercad to measure the voltage drop across each capacitor.
   - You will observe that the smaller capacitor (1 μF) has a higher voltage drop compared to the larger capacitor (10 μF).
   - This is because, in a capacitive divider, the voltage divides inversely with capacitance: the smaller the capacitance, the larger the voltage drop across it.

In a series capacitor circuit, voltage divides inversely to capacitance. The formula for the voltage across each capacitor in a series circuit is:

\[
V_C = V_{in} \times \frac{C_{total}}{C}
\]

where:
- \( V_{in} \) is the total input voltage,
- \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor of interest,
- \( C_{total} \) is the equivalent capacitance of the series combination.

Since smaller capacitors have higher impedance in an AC circuit, they "take" more of the applied voltage, just as in a resistive divider, higher resistance takes more voltage.
