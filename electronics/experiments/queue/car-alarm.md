This paradox occurs because current-sensing car alarm systems detect unauthorized access by monitoring sudden increases in current draw when something in the car is activated (like lights, doors, or ignition). Here’s why a weaker (degraded) car battery can actually improve the alarm’s sensitivity:

1. Increased Sensitivity to Current Changes:
   - A weak or degraded battery has a higher internal resistance, which limits its ability to deliver consistent current.
   - When any additional device (such as an interior light or radio) is turned on, the sudden current draw causes a more noticeable voltage drop in a weak battery compared to a healthy one.
   - This drop makes it easier for the alarm's current-sensing system to detect even small changes in current, improving the system’s sensitivity.

2. Lower Baseline Current:
   - A weak battery often results in a lower baseline current draw as the car’s systems try to conserve power.
   - This lower baseline makes any increase in current (like an attempt to access or start the car) more pronounced, enabling the alarm to detect changes more easily.

In a degraded battery, higher internal resistance and lower baseline current make current changes more pronounced, improving the alarm’s ability to detect unauthorized activity. So, paradoxically, the worse the car battery, the better the alarm system can detect small current changes.

An experiment to demonstrate the concept that a weaker power source (like a degraded battery) makes a current-sensing system more sensitive to small current changes:

### Experiment

Simulating a Car Alarm Current-Sensing System with Strong vs. Weak Power Sources

To demonstrate how a degraded (weaker) power source enhances the detection of small current changes compared to a strong power source.

#### Components:

- 1 Stable DC Power Source (e.g., 9V battery)
- 1 Variable Resistor (or potentiometer, 1 kΩ, to simulate internal resistance)
- 1 Sensitive Current Sensor Module (e.g., ACS712 or similar)
- 1 LED (or small bulb) and Current-Limiting Resistor (to simulate the "trigger event" in the car)
- Multimeter (to measure voltage drop)
- Breadboard and Wires

#### Steps:

1. Set Up the Strong Power Source Scenario:
   - Connect the 9V battery to the breadboard to act as the main power source.
   - Connect the current sensor module in series with the positive terminal of the battery.
   - Attach the LED (with current-limiting resistor) in series with the sensor to complete the circuit.
   - Measure the baseline current through the sensor using the multimeter and note any small increases when the LED is turned on (simulating a current "spike").

2. Simulate a Weak Power Source:
   - Insert the variable resistor in series with the battery’s positive terminal to simulate increased internal resistance, representing a degraded battery.
   - Adjust the variable resistor to increase the resistance gradually, creating a "weaker" power source.
   - With the same LED setup, measure the baseline current again and observe how turning on the LED (or any small load) now causes a more noticeable current change.

3. Observe and Compare:
   - Note the difference in current change detection between the two setups (strong vs. weak power source).
   - In the weak power source scenario, the current sensor should show a more significant response to the small load change (LED activation), mimicking the increased sensitivity of a current-sensing car alarm with a degraded battery.

The added internal resistance in the weak power source causes a more noticeable change in the current sensed when a small load is activated, making it easier to detect small current increases. This setup illustrates how a weaker battery enhances the sensitivity of a current-sensing system, similar to how a car alarm becomes more sensitive with a degraded battery.

Yes, modifications are needed for Tinkercad:

1. Current Sensor Replacement:
   - Tinkercad doesn’t have a current sensor module, so use a multimeter in series with the load to monitor current changes.

2. Variable Resistor:
   - Use a potentiometer to simulate the variable internal resistance of a weak battery.

3. Simulated Load Change:
   - Use an LED with a current-limiting resistor as the load, and turn it on/off to observe the current change with different potentiometer settings.

These modifications enable the experiment to work in Tinkercad.
