A simple experiment to illustrate the thermoelectric effect.

### Objective:

To demonstrate how a temperature difference across two different metals can generate a voltage.

### Materials:

- Two different metal wires (e.g., copper and constantan or copper and iron)
- A multimeter set to measure voltage (in millivolts)
- A heat source (e.g., a candle or hot water)
- Ice or cold water
- Connecting wires

### Procedure:

1. Create a Thermocouple:

Twist or solder one end of the copper wire to one end of the constantan (or iron) wire. This junction will be your thermocouple.

2. Connect to the Multimeter:

Connect the free ends of the copper and constantan wires to the multimeter's positive and negative terminals using the connecting wires. Set the multimeter to measure millivolts (mV).

3. Apply a Temperature Difference:

   - Place the junction of the two metals (where they are twisted or soldered together) into the heat source, such as holding it above a candle flame or placing it in hot water.
   - Simultaneously, place the free ends of the wires into a cold environment, such as in ice or cold water.

4. Observe the Voltage:

As the temperature difference between the junction and the free ends of the wires increases, you should observe a small voltage on the multimeter. The voltage reading is a direct result of the thermoelectric effect.

5. Vary the Temperature Difference:

Try different temperature differences by adjusting the heat source or the cold environment, and observe how the voltage on the multimeter changes accordingly.

This experiment demonstrates the thermoelectric effect, specifically the Seebeck effect. When there is a temperature difference between the junction and the ends of two different metals, a voltage is generated due to the movement of charge carriers from the hot side to the cold side. This voltage can be measured with the multimeter, illustrating how temperature differences can be converted directly into electrical energy. This principle is the basis for devices like thermocouples and thermoelectric generators.
