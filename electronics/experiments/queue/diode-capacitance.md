Review and see if this experiment can be done in Tinkercad

To observe the effect of diode capacitance:

a) Set up a circuit with a signal generator, a diode, and an oscilloscope.
b) Apply a high-frequency (e.g., 10MHz) square wave to the diode.
c) Observe the output waveform on the oscilloscope.
d) Notice the rounding of square wave edges due to diode capacitance.
e) Increase the reverse bias across the diode and observe how the waveform becomes sharper, demonstrating reduced capacitance.
