An experiment to demonstrate current limiting using a transistor.

Components needed:

1. 2N2222 NPN transistor
2. LED (any color)
3. 1kΩ resistor
4. 10kΩ potentiometer
5. 9V battery or power supply
6. Breadboard and jumper wires

Setup instructions:
1. Place the components on the breadboard
2. Connect the circuit as shown in the diagram
3. The potentiometer will control the base current, which in turn limits the collector current

To perform the experiment:
1. Build the circuit in Tinkercad
2. Start with the potentiometer at maximum resistance
3. Turn on the simulation
4. Slowly decrease the potentiometer resistance
5. Observe how the LED brightness changes as you adjust the base current

Expected results:
- When the potentiometer is at maximum resistance, the LED will be dim or off
- As you decrease the resistance, more base current flows
- The LED brightness will increase until it reaches maximum brightness
- The transistor prevents the LED from drawing too much current, protecting it from damage

You can use Tinkercad's built-in multimeter to measure:
- Base current at different potentiometer positions
- Collector current through the LED
- The relationship between base current and collector current (β or hFE)
