A low-pass filter allows lower frequencies to pass through while attenuating higher frequencies. You can design a simple RC low-pass filter in Tinkercad to observe how it filters out high frequencies and allows low frequencies to pass.

### Components:

1. AC Voltage Source: Set to generate various frequencies (e.g., a sine wave).
2. Resistor: 1 kΩ.
3. Capacitor: 0.1 µF.
4. Oscilloscope: To observe the input and output waveforms.

### Setup:

1. Create the RC Low-Pass Filter:
   - Connect one terminal of the AC source to the resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to one terminal of the capacitor.
   - Connect the other terminal of the capacitor to ground.

2. Output Point:
   - The output is taken across the capacitor. Connect the oscilloscope probe here to observe the output signal.
   - Also, place another oscilloscope probe across the AC source to observe the input signal for comparison.

3. Set Up the Oscilloscope:
   - Connect the first oscilloscope probe to the input (AC source) and the second probe to the output (across the capacitor).
   - This setup allows you to observe how the input and output signals compare at different frequencies.

### Steps:

1. Run the Simulation:
   - Start the Tinkercad simulation.
   - Set the AC source to a high frequency, such as 10 kHz, to observe how the circuit behaves at higher frequencies.

2. Observing High-Frequency Response:
   - With a high-frequency input, check the oscilloscope to see the output across the capacitor.
   - Expected Outcome: At high frequencies, the output signal will be much weaker or nearly zero. This is because the capacitor’s impedance is low at high frequencies, causing most of the signal to bypass the output and go to ground.

3. Decrease the Frequency:
   - Gradually decrease the frequency of the AC source to around 1 kHz and then lower (e.g., 10 Hz).
   - Expected Outcome: As the frequency decreases, the output signal amplitude should increase. This is because the capacitor’s impedance increases at lower frequencies, allowing more of the input signal to pass through to the output.

4. Calculate the Cutoff Frequency:
   - The cutoff frequency \( f_c \) of an RC low-pass filter is given by:
     \[
     f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi RC}
     \]
   - For a 1 kΩ resistor and a 0.1 µF capacitor, the cutoff frequency is approximately 1.59 kHz. Below this frequency, signals pass through with minimal attenuation; above this frequency, signals are increasingly attenuated.

5. Test at the Cutoff Frequency:
   - Set the AC source frequency near the cutoff frequency (around 1.6 kHz).
   - Expected Outcome: At the cutoff frequency, the output signal amplitude should be approximately 70% of the input signal amplitude, indicating the point where the filter begins to attenuate higher frequencies.

Low-Pass Filter Behavior:

This RC circuit acts as a low-pass filter because the capacitor allows low frequencies to pass while presenting low impedance to high frequencies, which causes them to be filtered out.

Cutoff Frequency:

The cutoff frequency is the point where the filter transitions from passing low frequencies to attenuating high frequencies. Frequencies below this point pass with minimal attenuation, while frequencies above are increasingly blocked.

This experiment demonstrates how an RC low-pass filter selectively allows lower frequencies while attenuating higher ones, which is useful in applications like audio signal processing, smoothing DC signals, and removing high-frequency noise.

Solving How an Inductor Works in a Filter Circuit:

Let’s assume we want to design a low-pass filter using an inductor and resistor to remove high-frequency noise from a signal.

1. Choose an inductor and resistor: For example, select a 100μH inductor and a 1kΩ resistor.

2. Calculate the cutoff frequency: Use the formula for the cutoff frequency of an RL low-pass filter:

   $$ f_c = \frac{R}{2\pi L} $$

   $$ f_c = \frac{1,000}{2\pi \times 100 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 1.59 \, \text{kHz} $$

   The cutoff frequency is about 1.59kHz, meaning frequencies below this pass through, while higher frequencies get filtered out.

3. Connect the inductor and resistor in series: Wire the inductor and resistor in series with the signal input.

4. Test the circuit: Feed a signal with high-frequency noise into the circuit. The inductor will block high frequencies, and only the clean, low-frequency part of the signal will pass through to the output.

This demonstrates how an inductor can be used to filter out unwanted high-frequency noise in a circuit.

To design a low-pass filter experiment using Tinkercad, follow these steps:

### Objective

Create a simple RC (Resistor-Capacitor) low-pass filter to observe how it allows low-frequency signals to pass while attenuating higher frequencies.

### Components

1. Resistor (R) - 10 kΩ (or any suitable resistance)
2. Capacitor (C) - 0.1 µF
3. Signal Generator - To provide variable frequency signals (use the Function Generator in Tinkercad's circuit workspace)
4. Oscilloscope - To observe the input and output signals (use the oscilloscope in Tinkercad)
5. Breadboard - For connecting components

### Setup

1. Connect the Resistor and Capacitor in Series:
   - Place the resistor on the breadboard and connect it to the signal generator's output.
   - Connect the capacitor’s positive leg to the other end of the resistor.
   - Connect the capacitor's negative leg to the ground of the signal generator.
2. Connect Oscilloscope Probes:
   - Place the oscilloscope probe at the input (signal generator output before the resistor) to monitor the input signal.
   - Place another oscilloscope probe at the output (junction between resistor and capacitor) to monitor the output signal.

### Procedure

1. Set Signal Generator: Start with a low-frequency signal (e.g., 100 Hz) with a small amplitude (e.g., 5V peak).
2. Observe Input and Output Signals: Check both signals on the oscilloscope.
3. Increase Frequency: Gradually increase the frequency (e.g., 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz, and so on).
4. Record Observations: Note how the amplitude of the output signal changes compared to the input as you increase frequency.

### Expected Results

- At low frequencies, the output signal's amplitude should be close to the input amplitude.
- As the frequency increases, the output amplitude should decrease, showing the low-pass filter effect.

This experiment demonstrates that an RC low-pass filter allows low-frequency signals to pass while attenuating high frequencies, verifying the behavior of a simple low-pass filter.
