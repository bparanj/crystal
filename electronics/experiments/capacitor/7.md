### **Context**

This experiment demonstrates the charging and discharging behavior of capacitors in DC circuits. A simple RC circuit is used to show how capacitors charge and discharge. This stabilizes voltage changes and acts as a temporary power source. 

### **Problem Statement**

How does a capacitor store and release electrical energy in a circuit? The goal is to illustrate the charging and discharging process of a capacitor and the role of resistors in controlling this behavior.

### **Terminology**

**Capacitor:** 

A component that stores electrical energy in an electric field, charging when connected to a voltage source and discharging when the source is removed.

**RC Circuit:** 

A circuit combining a resistor and a capacitor, which determines the charging and discharging rates of the capacitor.

**Time Constant (\( \tau \)):** The product of resistance (\(R\)) and capacitance (\(C\)), defining the rate of capacitor charging and discharging:
   \[
   \tau = R \times C
   \]

A capacitor can store electrical energy and release it gradually when the circuit is disconnected, demonstrating its role in energy storage.

With the slideswitch on, the capacitor charges to the supply voltage (9V). Turning the switch off shows a gradual decrease in voltage, indicating the capacitor is discharging.
