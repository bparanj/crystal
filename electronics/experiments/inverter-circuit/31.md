### **Context**

Inverter circuits, also known as NOT gates, are fundamental to digital logic. These circuits invert the input signal: when the input is HIGH, the output is LOW, and vice versa. By demonstrating this principle with a simple circuit, we explore how a transistor can act as a switch to implement logical inversion. This experiment serves as a practical foundation for understanding more complex digital systems.

### **Problem Statement**

How does an inverter circuit invert a digital signal, and what is the behavior of its components under varying input conditions? The goal is to design and analyze a simple inverter circuit, observing its behavior with an LED as a visual indicator.

### **Terminology**

1. **Inverter (NOT Gate):** A logic circuit that outputs the opposite logic level of its input.
2. **NPN Transistor:** A semiconductor device used here as a switch. When its base receives sufficient voltage, it allows current to flow between the collector and emitter.
3. **Resistor:** A component that limits current and ensures proper voltage levels in the circuit.

#### 1. **The Role of an Inverter**

An inverter flips the logic level of its input signal:

- Input HIGH (5V) → Output LOW (0V)
- Input LOW (0V) → Output HIGH (5V)

This behavior is implemented using an NPN transistor, which switches ON or OFF based on the voltage applied to its base. The LED provides visual feedback, turning ON or OFF depending on the circuit's output.

#### 2. **Building the Circuit**

The circuit is constructed step-by-step to implement the NOT logic. A 10kΩ resistor (R2) acts as the input to the transistor's base, controlling its switching behavior. A second resistor limits the LED's current, preventing damage.

#### 3. **Observing Inverting Behavior**

The circuit is tested under different input conditions:
- R2 connected to 5V (input HIGH): LED turns OFF (output LOW)
- R2 connected to ground (input LOW): LED turns ON (output HIGH)

### Steps

#### Step 1: 

- Take a breadboard as the base for the circuit.

#### Step 2: Resistors and Transistor

1. Place a **1kΩ resistor (R1)** between points **h4** and **h8**.
2. Place a **500Ω resistor** between points **d8** and **d12**.
3. Insert an **NPN transistor** (e.g., 2N3904) at points **i12**, **i13**, and **i14**.

#### Step 3: LED

- Connect an **LED** between points **c12** and **c13**, with its **anode** (long leg) connected to the 500Ω resistor.

#### Step 4: Power Connections

1. Connect the cathode of the LED to the negative rail (ground) using a black wire from **d13**.
2. Connect the emitter of the transistor to ground (negative rail) using a black wire from **f15**.

#### Step 5: Base Resistor

- Add a **10kΩ resistor (R2)** between points **h17** and **h21**. This controls the transistor's base voltage.

#### Step 6: Connect the Circuit

1. Link the 1kΩ resistor (R1) to the transistor's collector using a green wire from **e8** to **f8**.
2. Connect the base of the transistor to R2 using a green wire from **g8** to **g17**.
3. Connect R2 to the positive rail using a red wire from **j21**.

#### Step 7: Power Supply

- Connect a 5V power supply to the breadboard's positive and negative rails.

### **How It Works**

#### Input LOW (0V or Floating)

- The transistor's base receives no significant voltage.
- The transistor remains OFF, acting like an open switch.
- Current flows through R1 → LED → ground, turning the LED ON.

#### Input HIGH (5V)

- The transistor's base receives sufficient voltage (≥0.7V).
- The transistor turns ON, acting like a closed switch.
- Current flows through R1 → transistor → ground, bypassing the LED.
- The LED turns OFF.

### **Using a Switch for Input Control**

To avoid manually connecting and disconnecting R2, a slide switch can be added:
1. Connect R2's end to the middle pin of the slide switch (e.g., **g24**, **g25**, **g26**).
2. Connect one terminal of the switch to the positive rail (5V).
3. Connect the other terminal to the negative rail (ground).

When the switch is toggled:
- **ON (connected to 5V):** LED turns OFF.
- **OFF (connected to ground):** LED turns ON.

This inverter circuit demonstrates logical NOT behavior:

- HIGH input → LOW output (LED OFF)
- LOW input → HIGH output (LED ON)

Understanding this behavior is fundamental to designing digital systems, as inverters form the building blocks of more complex gates like NAND and NOR. This experiment provides a clear visualization of logical inversion and transistor switching behavior.

An inverter is called that way because it "inverts" or reverses the input signal:

- When input is HIGH (5V), output is LOW (0V)
- When input is LOW (0V), output is HIGH (5V)

1. When you connect the input (R2) to 5V:
   - Input is HIGH
   - LED turns OFF (output is LOW)

2. When you connect input to ground (or leave it floating):
   - Input is LOW
   - LED turns ON (output is HIGH)

This inverting behavior is fundamental to digital logic. This circuit is also known as a NOT gate because it performs the logical NOT operation: whatever the input is, the output is the opposite.

An inverter circuit flips logic levels, enabling digital logic gates like NOT, NAND, and NOR.

A basic inverter (NOT gate) circuit.

Components:

1. 1x NPN transistor (2N3904)
2. 1x 1kΩ resistor (R1)
3. 1x 10kΩ resistor (R2)
4. 5V power supply
5. Breadboard
6. Connecting wires

How it works:

- When the input is LOW (0V), the transistor is OFF, and the output is HIGH (≈5V)
- When the input is HIGH (5V), the transistor turns ON, and the output is LOW (≈0V)

1. When R2 is connected to ground or left unconnected (floating):
   - The transistor's base doesn't receive enough voltage to turn ON
   - The transistor stays OFF (like an open switch)
   - Current flows through R1 → LED → R3 → Ground
   - So the LED stays ON

2. When R2 is connected to 5V (positive):
   - The transistor's base receives voltage through R2
   - The transistor turns ON (like a closed switch)
   - The collector-emitter path becomes almost a short circuit
   - Most current flows through R1 → transistor → ground (bypassing the LED)
   - So the LED turns OFF

This is normal behavior because:

- The transistor's base-emitter junction needs about 0.7V to conduct
- When floating or grounded, this voltage isn't reached
- The high-value resistor R2 (10kΩ) also helps prevent any stray voltage from accidentally turning on the transistor

So you're seeing the correct operation of the inverter:

- Input HIGH (5V) → Output LOW (LED OFF)
- Input LOW (0V or floating) → Output HIGH (LED ON)
