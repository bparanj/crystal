### **Context**

This experiment demonstrates the concept of an RC delay timer. We observe how the charging time of a capacitor creates a time delay before an LED lights up. The circuit relies on the RC time constant to control the delay, showing how resistors and capacitors can influence timing behavior in electronics. The experiment also uses a transistor to amplify and control the LED's behavior based on the capacitor's charge.

### **Problem Statement**

How can we use an RC circuit to create a time delay in lighting an LED? What happens when we adjust the capacitance, and how does this change the delay?

The goal is to observe and understand how the RC time constant (\( \tau = R \times C \)) impacts the timing of the LED illumination.

### **Terminology**

**RC Circuit:**

A combination of a resistor and a capacitor that determines the time it takes for a capacitor to charge or discharge.

**Time Constant (\( \tau \)):**

The product of resistance (R) and capacitance (C), representing the time it takes the capacitor to charge to ~63% of its maximum voltage.

**Transistor (NPN):**

A semiconductor device used here as a switch that allows current flow to the LED once the capacitor charges to a threshold voltage.

#### **RC Timing and Circuit Behavior**

The RC circuit creates a delay by controlling how long it takes the capacitor to charge. Initially, the capacitor charges through the resistor. As the voltage across the capacitor increases, it eventually reaches the base-emitter threshold voltage of the NPN transistor. This activates the transistor, allowing current to flow to the LED, which then lights up.

### Steps

The resistor and capacitor form the core RC circuit. The transistor acts as a switch that activates the LED. A second resistor limits the current to the LED, preventing damage.

### **Examples**

1. **Initial Configuration:** With a 500 μF capacitor, the delay before the LED lights up is shorter (~5 seconds, depending on R and C values).
2. **Increased Delay:** Replacing the 500 μF capacitor with a 4000 μF capacitor extends the delay significantly (~40 seconds). This illustrates the proportionality of the delay to the capacitor value.

This experiment demonstrates how RC circuits control timing in electronics. The resistor and capacitor pair form a predictable delay mechanism, and the transistor acts as a switch that activates once the capacitor's voltage threshold is reached. Adjusting component values, such as the capacitance, provides precise control over the delay.

Applications of RC delay circuits include timer circuits, signal processing, and debounce circuits. Understanding this foundational concept is critical for designing systems with controlled timing behavior.

RC Delay Timer

To introduce a delay using an RC (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit in Tinkercad, you can set up a simple LED circuit where the LED lights up after a delay, controlled by the charging time of the capacitor.

To demonstrate a basic delay using an RC circuit.

- 1 Power Source (e.g., 9V battery)
- 1 Resistor (e.g., 10 kΩ)
- 1 Capacitor (e.g., 500 μF)
- 1 NPN Transistor (e.g., 2N2222)
- 1 LED
- 1 Resistor for LED (e.g., 220 Ω)

- As the capacitor charges, the voltage at the transistor’s base gradually increases.
- Once the voltage reaches a certain threshold, the transistor turns on, allowing current to flow through the LED and lighting it up.
- The time delay before the LED lights up is determined by the RC time constant, which is the product of the resistor and capacitor values ( \( \tau = R \times C \) ).

Change the value of the capacitor from 500 micro F to 4000 micro F to demonstrate the increase in time delay.
