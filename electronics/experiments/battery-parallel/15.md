This shows how two 9V batteries in parallel can provide increased current capacity but not increased voltage. When using one 9V battery, the current flowing through the load will be limited by that single batteryâ€™s capacity. With two 9V batteries in parallel, the current supply capability effectively doubles, allowing more current to flow through the same load.

### Context and Problem

This experiment is about the behavior of batteries connected in parallel. Parallel connections allow multiple power sources to combine their current supply capabilities while maintaining the same voltage. This principle is applied for designing circuits that require higher current capacity without increasing voltage.

### Terminology

- **Parallel Connection:**

A configuration where the positive terminals of multiple batteries are connected together, as are the negative terminals. This maintains the same voltage across all batteries but combines their current capabilities.

- **Current Capacity:**

The total amount of current a power source can supply. Batteries in parallel increase this capacity by sharing the load.

- **Multimeter:**

A tool used to measure electrical properties, including voltage and current.

### Steps

#### **Step 1: Single Battery Voltage Measurement**

1. Connect the **positive terminal** of the multimeter to the **positive terminal** of a single 9V battery.
2. Connect the **negative terminal** of the multimeter to the **negative terminal** of the battery.
3. Run the simulation. The multimeter displays a voltage of **9V**, confirming the battery's output.

#### **Step 2: Single Battery Current Measurement**

1. Stop the simulation and change the multimeter setting to **current measurement mode (amperes)**.
2. Connect the multimeter directly across the battery terminals.
3. Run the simulation. The multimeter shows a current of **6 amperes**, determined by the battery's internal resistance and the multimeter's low resistance in current mode.

#### **Step 3: Connecting Batteries in Parallel**

1. Disconnect the multimeter from the first battery.
2. Add a second 9V battery to the setup.
3. Connect the **positive terminals** of both batteries together.
4. Connect the **negative terminals** of both batteries together.
   - This creates a **parallel connection**, ensuring the same voltage across both batteries while combining their current capacities.

#### **Step 4: Measuring Voltage Across Parallel Batteries**

1. Connect the multimeter's **positive terminal** to the **positive terminal** of either battery.
2. Connect the multimeter's **negative terminal** to the **negative terminal** of either battery.
3. Set the multimeter to **voltage measurement mode (volts)**.
4. Run the simulation. The multimeter displays **9V**, showing that the voltage across both batteries remains the same as a single battery in the parallel configuration.

#### **Step 5: Measuring Current Capacity in Parallel Batteries**

1. Change the multimeter setting to **current measurement mode (amperes)**.
2. Connect the multimeter in series with the circuit.
3. Run the simulation. The multimeter shows a current of **12 amperes**, indicating that the current capacity has doubled compared to a single battery.

#### Voltage in Parallel Connections

In a parallel configuration, the voltage across each branch remains the same. The second battery does not increase the voltage, which remains at **9V**.

#### Current in Parallel Connections

The current capacity of the circuit increases because the batteries share the load. Each battery supplies part of the total current, resulting in a combined current of **12 amperes**, twice the capacity of a single battery. This property makes parallel configurations ideal for applications requiring higher current without exceeding a specific voltage.

This experiment demonstrates:

- **Voltage Stability:** The voltage across parallel batteries remains constant.
- **Increased Current Capacity:** Adding batteries in parallel enhances the circuit's ability to deliver higher current, distributing the load among the batteries.

Practical applications are systems where higher current is required for powering multiple devices or maintaining longer battery life without increasing the operating voltage.
