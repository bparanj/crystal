Occilloscope is an electronic test equipment for measuring input and output signals.

The positive lead is connected to the positive terminal of the device to measure and the negative lead to the ground.

You can adjust the time per division to view the wafeform. 

Function generator is an electronic device used to generate various voltage waveforms. There are three different waveforms available in the settings window: square, sine and triangle. The amplitude is ... It is displayed in volts. The frequence is displayed in hertz. The DC offset is ...

Connect the positive lead to the positive terminal on the device to send the signal and connect the negative terminal to ground.

In the settings, we can edit its name, frequency, amplitude, DC offset and function wave shape.
