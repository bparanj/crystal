### **Context**

This experiment explores the behavior of an RL (Resistor-Inductor) high-pass filter. High-pass filters are used to block low-frequency signals while allowing high-frequency signals to pass. By observing the response of this filter to a range of frequencies, we gain insights into the fundamental principles of inductive reactance and frequency-dependent behavior.

### **Problem Statement**

How does an RL high-pass filter respond to signals of varying frequencies, and how can we identify the cutoff frequency where the filter transitions from attenuating to passing signals? The goal is to demonstrate the principles of high-pass filtering using an inductor and resistor in series.

### **Terminology**

1. **High-Pass Filter:** 

A circuit that allows high-frequency signals to pass while attenuating signals below a specific cutoff frequency.

2. **Inductor:** 

A component that resists changes in current. Its impedance increases with frequency, defined as:
   \[
   X_L = 2 \pi f L
   \]

3. **Cutoff Frequency (\(f_c\)):** 

The frequency where the filter transitions from significant attenuation to passing signals, calculated as:
   \[
   f_c = \frac{R}{2 \pi L}
   \]


In an RL high-pass filter, the inductor's impedance increases with frequency. At low frequencies, the inductor behaves like a short circuit, bypassing most of the current. At high frequencies, its impedance increases, diverting more current through the resistor and increasing the output voltage across it.

The circuit is constructed with a series connection of an inductor and resistor. The input signal is applied across the inductor, and the output is measured across the resistor. An oscilloscope is used to observe the behavior of the input and output signals as the frequency changes.

The oscilloscope reveals how the filter attenuates low-frequency signals while allowing high-frequency signals to pass. The cutoff frequency is identified using the circuit's component values.

### Steps

#### Components

- **Inductor (\(L = 10 \, \text{mH}\))**
- **Resistor (\(R = 1 \, \text{k}\Omega\))**
- Function Generator (AC Source)
- Oscilloscope

#### Step 1: Assemble the Filter

- Place the inductor and resistor on the breadboard.
- Connect one terminal of the inductor to one terminal of the resistor, forming a series connection.

#### Step 2: Connect the Function Generator

- Connect the positive terminal of the function generator to the free terminal of the inductor.
- Connect the negative terminal of the function generator to the breadboard’s ground rail.

#### Step 3: Configure the Oscilloscope

- Connect the positive terminal of the oscilloscope to the junction of the resistor and inductor.
- Connect the oscilloscope’s negative terminal to the ground rail.
- Ensure the ground terminals of the function generator and oscilloscope are connected to the same rail.

#### Step 4: Function Generator Settings

- Configure the function generator:
  - **Waveform:** Sine wave
  - **Amplitude:** \(5 \, \text{V}_{\text{peak-to-peak}}\)
  - **Frequency:** Sweep from \(10 \, \text{Hz}\) to \(10 \, \text{kHz}\)

#### Step 5: Run the Simulation

- Start the simulation and observe the input and output waveforms on the oscilloscope.

### **Observations**

#### Low-Frequency Behavior (\(f < f_c\))

- At low frequencies (e.g., \(10 \, \text{Hz}\)):
  - The inductor acts as a low-impedance path, allowing most of the current to bypass the resistor.
  - The output voltage across the resistor is near zero, indicating significant attenuation.

#### High-Frequency Behavior (\(f > f_c\))

- At high frequencies (e.g., \(10 \, \text{kHz}\)):
  - The inductor’s impedance increases, diverting more current through the resistor.
  - The output voltage across the resistor matches the input voltage, showing minimal attenuation.

#### Cutoff Frequency (\(f_c\))

- The transition from attenuation to passing signals occurs at the cutoff frequency:
  \[
  f_c = \frac{R}{2 \pi L} = \frac{1000}{2 \pi \cdot 0.01} \approx 15.9 \, \text{kHz}
  \]

### Results

1. **Frequency Response:**
   - At frequencies below \(f_c\), the output voltage is significantly attenuated, demonstrating the filter’s ability to block low-frequency signals.
   - At frequencies above \(f_c\), the output voltage closely matches the input, showing the filter’s ability to pass high-frequency signals.

2. **Applications:**
   - RL high-pass filters are used in signal processing to remove unwanted low-frequency noise or isolate high-frequency components.

3. **Visualization:**
   - The oscilloscope provides clear evidence of attenuation at low frequencies and signal preservation at high frequencies, confirming the filter’s functionality.

This experiment illustrates the fundamental behavior of RL high-pass filters:

- **Low Frequencies:** The inductor bypasses current, reducing the output voltage.
- **High Frequencies:** The inductor diverts current through the resistor, allowing signals to pass.

Understanding the operation of RL high-pass filters is critical for designing circuits in communication systems, audio processing, and signal conditioning. By identifying the cutoff frequency, designers can tailor the filter to specific application requirements. This practical demonstration reinforces the theoretical principles of frequency-dependent filtering in electronics.

### High-Pass Filter Using Resistor and Inductor

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of a high-pass filter using a resistor and an inductor. The filter blocks low frequencies and passes high frequencies.

1. Inductor: 10 mH
2. Resistor: \(1 \, \text{k}\Omega\)
3. Function Generator (AC Source)
4. Oscilloscope (to observe input and output signals)
5. Breadboard
6. Jumper Wires


   - Place the inductor and resistor on the breadboard.

   - Connect one terminal of the inductor to one terminal of the resistor.
   - This series connection forms the filter.

   - Connect the positive terminal of the function generator to the free terminal of the inductor.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the function generator to the breadboard's ground rail.

   - Connect the positive terminal of the oscilloscope to the junction of the resistor and inductor.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the oscilloscope to the ground rail.

   - Ensure the ground of the function generator and oscilloscope are connected to the same ground rail.


1. Waveform: Sine wave.
2. Amplitude: \(5 \, \text{V}_{\text{peak-to-peak}}\).
3. Frequency Sweep: Start at \(10 \, \text{Hz}\), gradually increase to \(10 \, \text{kHz}\).

1. Run the Simulation:
   - Observe the input and output signals on the oscilloscope at different frequencies.

2. Low-Frequency Behavior:
   - At low frequencies (e.g., \(10 \, \text{Hz}\)), the inductor passes most of the current, causing the output voltage across the resistor to drop.

3. High-Frequency Behavior:
   - At high frequencies (e.g., \(10 \, \text{kHz}\)), the inductor blocks the current due to increased inductive reactance, and the output voltage across the resistor approaches the input voltage.

### Observations

- Low Frequencies: The output voltage is near zero.
- High Frequencies: The output voltage matches the input.
- Cutoff Frequency: Use \(f_c = \frac{R}{2 \pi L}\) to determine the transition point.

### Results

This setup allows you to observe how the resistor-inductor high-pass filter behaves, passing high frequencies and attenuating low frequencies, effectively demonstrating its functionality in Tinkercad.
