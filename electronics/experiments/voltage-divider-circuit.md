 A basic voltage divider consists of two resistors connected in series across a voltage source, with the output voltage taken from the connection point between the two resistors.
 A voltage divider resembles a water pipe with two constrictions in series. Just as the water pressure decreases after each constriction, the voltage "drops" across each resistor in the divider.
 
 To construct a basic voltage divider, follow these steps:

 1) Obtain two resistors (e.g., 1kΩ and 2kΩ) and a 9V battery.
 2) Connect the resistors in series: attach one end of the 1kΩ resistor to the positive terminal of the battery.
 3) Connect the other end of the 1kΩ resistor to one end of the 2kΩ resistor.
 4) Connect the free end of the 2kΩ resistor to the negative terminal of the battery.
 5) The voltage divider output is the point between the two resistors. Measure the voltage at this point with respect to the negative battery terminal.

 You should observe a voltage of approximately 6V, which is 2/3 of the input voltage, as the 2kΩ resistor is 2/3 of the total resistance.
 
 ## Voltage division

 A simple voltage division circuit is a fundamental electronic circuit that uses two resistors to create a lower voltage from a higher voltage source. Here's a description of a basic voltage divider:

 Components:
 
 1. Two resistors (R1 and R2)
 2. Input voltage source (Vin)
 3. Output voltage (Vout)

 Circuit layout:
 
 1. R1 and R2 are connected in series
 2. Vin is applied across both resistors
 3. Vout is measured across R2

 The circuit looks like this:

 ```
      Vin
       |
       R1
       |
 Vout ---|
       |
       R2
       |
      GND
 ```

 How it works:
 
 1. The input voltage (Vin) is split across the two resistors
 2. The output voltage (Vout) is taken from the midpoint between R1 and R2
 3. Vout is always less than or equal to Vin

 The relationship between Vin and Vout is given by the formula:

 Vout = Vin * (R2 / (R1 + R2))

 Key points:

 1. The ratio of R1 to R2 determines the output voltage
 2. Changing the resistor values changes the output voltage
 3. The total current through both resistors remains constant
 4. This circuit is most effective when the load impedance is much higher than R2

 Applications:

 1. Reducing voltage for sensors or low-voltage components
 2. Creating reference voltages
 3. Level shifting in signal processing
 4. Biasing in amplifier circuits

 This simple circuit is the basis for many more complex voltage division applications in electronics.
