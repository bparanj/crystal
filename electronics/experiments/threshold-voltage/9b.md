### **Context**

This experiment illustrates the concept of **forward voltage** and how it governs the behavior of an LED. Forward voltage is the minimum voltage required for an LED to conduct current and emit light. By gradually increasing the voltage in a controlled circuit, we observe the LED turning on and becoming brighter as the current increases. The experiment also emphasizes the importance of limiting current to protect the LED from damage.

### **Problem Statement**

What is forward voltage, and how does it influence the operation of an LED? The goal is to explore the threshold voltage at which an LED starts conducting, examine its brightness as current increases, and demonstrate the need for current limiting to ensure safe operation.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Forward Voltage:** The minimum voltage required across the LED for it to conduct current and emit light.
2. **Forward Bias:** The configuration where the positive terminal of the power supply connects to the anode of the LED, enabling current flow.
3. **Threshold Voltage:** The specific forward voltage at which the LED begins to emit light.
4. **Current Limiting Resistor:** A resistor used to control the current through the LED, protecting it from excessive current.

### **Structure of the Explanation**

#### 1. **Foundation: The Role of Forward Voltage**

An LED requires a certain forward voltage to overcome the internal barrier to current flow. Below this voltage, the LED remains off. As the voltage increases beyond this threshold, the LED turns on, and its brightness increases as the current through it rises.

#### 2. **Progressive Development: Building the Circuit**

The circuit uses a power supply, resistor, and LED. A variable DC power supply adjusts the voltage, allowing us to observe the LED's behavior at different voltages.

#### 3. **Resolution: Observing and Explaining Behavior**

The LED turns on at its forward voltage threshold and brightens with increasing current. The resistor limits current, protecting the LED at higher voltages.

### **Procedure**

#### Observing the Threshold Voltage
1. **Set Initial Voltage:**
   - Adjust the power supply to \(1 \, \text{V}\). Run the simulation. The LED remains off as the voltage is below the threshold.

2. **Gradually Increase Voltage:**
   - Raise the voltage to \(1.8 \, \text{V}\). The LED begins to emit a faint light, indicating the threshold voltage is reached.

3. **Monitor Brightness and Current:**
   - Continue increasing the voltage:
     - At \(2.1 \, \text{V}\), the LED brightens as current increases to \(331 \, \mu\text{A}\).
     - At \(3 \, \text{V}\), brightness improves, and current rises to \(1.17 \, \text{mA}\).
     - At \(5 \, \text{V}\), the LED is much brighter, with a current of \(3.11 \, \text{mA}\).

#### Observing Maximum Brightness and Risks
4. **Approach Maximum Current:**
   - Increase the voltage to \(22 \, \text{V}\). The current reaches \(19.9 \, \text{mA}\), the LED's maximum safe current. The LED achieves peak brightness.

5. **Exceed Safe Limits:**
   - At \(22.1 \, \text{V}\), the current exceeds \(20 \, \text{mA}\). The LED becomes stressed, risking damage.

---

### **Observations**

1. **Threshold Voltage:**
   - The LED begins to emit light when the applied voltage exceeds \(1.8–2.1 \, \text{V}\) (forward voltage threshold for a red LED).

2. **Brightness and Current Relationship:**
   - As voltage increases, the LED’s brightness intensifies due to higher current flow. Current rises non-linearly with voltage, typical of a diode's behavior.

3. **Role of the Resistor:**
   - The \(1 \, \text{k}\Omega\) resistor limits current, protecting the LED from excessive current at higher voltages.

4. **Maximum Safe Current:**
   - At currents above \(20 \, \text{mA}\), the LED risks overheating and damage.

---

### **Results and Analysis**

1. **Forward Voltage Threshold:**
   - The experiment demonstrates that the LED remains off below its forward voltage. Once this threshold is exceeded, the LED conducts and emits light.

2. **Current and Brightness:**
   - Brightness increases with current, controlled by the resistor. The resistor prevents damage by keeping the current within the LED's safe operating range.

3. **Diode Behavior:**
   - The LED's non-linear current-voltage relationship highlights its nature as a diode.

4. **Importance of Current Limiting:**
   - Without a resistor, excessive current at higher voltages would quickly damage the LED.

---

### **Outcome and Relevance**

This experiment demonstrates the fundamental concepts of forward voltage and the LED’s threshold behavior. By observing the relationship between voltage, current, and brightness, we gain a practical understanding of how diodes operate and the importance of current-limiting components. The results emphasize safe circuit design practices, ensuring component longevity and reliability.

Threshold Voltage

What is forward voltage?

What is forward bias?

What is forward voltage threshold?

When the LED turns on in this circuit, it demonstrates forward voltage. Forward voltage is the voltage required for the LED to conduct current and emit light. When the LED is forward-biased and the voltage across it reaches a certain threshold called the forward voltage, it allows current to flow and the LED lights up. So, the LED turning on is an example of forward voltage in action.

Increase the voltage to volts. LED begins to run on.

Image 10

Step 11

Reduce the voltage to 1.5 volts. LED is now dimmer than before. But is still on.

Image 11

Step 12

Reduce the voltage to 1.25 volts. LED seems to be off. The current is 0 amperes. So it cannot be in a on state.

Image 21
Image 22

The LED starts to turn on when the applied voltage exceeds its forward voltage threshold (~1.8–2.1V for a red LED).

Below this voltage, there is not enough current to turn on the LED.

The brightness of the LED increases with current as the applied voltage rises.
The current increases non-linearly with voltage due to the LED's diode behavior.

The 1 kΩ resistor limits the current through the LED, preventing damage at higher voltages by keeping the current within a safe range.

At higher voltages (e.g., 22V), the LED reaches its maximum current capacity (~20 mA). Beyond this, the LED becomes stressed and risks damage.

The experiment demonstrates how an LED operates with respect to its forward voltage, the relationship between current and brightness, and the importance of current limiting to prevent damaging the LED.
