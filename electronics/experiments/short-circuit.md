A **short circuit** and a **connecting wire** are similar because both provide a **low-resistance path** for electric current. Hereâ€™s how they are alike:

1. **Low Resistance Path**: Both a short circuit and a connecting wire have very low electrical resistance, allowing current to flow easily. 

2. **Direct Current Path**: In both cases, electricity flows directly from one point to another without significant opposition, which is the purpose of a connecting wire in a circuit.

3. **Voltage Drop**: Both have minimal voltage drop across them, as there is little resistance to impede the current.

### Key Difference:
However, while a connecting wire is **intentionally** placed to route current safely between components, a short circuit is usually **unintentional** and can cause excessive current, overheating, or damage to components.
