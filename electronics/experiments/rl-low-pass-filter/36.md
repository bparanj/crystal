Experiment not working. 

### **Context**

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of an RL (Resistor-Inductor) low-pass filter. It is used to allow low-frequency signals to pass while attenuating high-frequency signals. By observing the response of this filter across a range of frequencies, we gain insights into the principles of inductive reactance and frequency-dependent attenuation.

### **Problem Statement**

How does an RL low-pass filter respond to signals of varying frequencies, and how can the cutoff frequency where attenuation begins be identified? The goal is to illustrate how the combination of a resistor and inductor filters signals based on frequency.

### **Terminology**

**Low-Pass Filter:**

A circuit that passes low-frequency signals while attenuating high-frequency signals.

**Inductor:**

A component that opposes changes in current. Its impedance increases with frequency, defined as:
   \[
   X_L = 2 \pi f L
   \]

**Cutoff Frequency (\(f_c\)):**

The frequency where the filter transitions from passing to attenuating signals, calculated as:
   \[
   f_c = \frac{R}{2 \pi L}
   \]

The RL low-pass filter uses an inductor to block high-frequency signals due to its increasing impedance at higher frequencies. At low frequencies, the inductor allows current to pass freely, maintaining the output voltage.

The filter is built with a resistor and inductor in series. The input signal is applied across the resistor, and the output is measured across the inductor. An oscilloscope visualizes the behavior of the signals as the input frequency changes.

By sweeping the input frequency, we observe the transition from minimal attenuation at low frequencies to significant attenuation at high frequencies. The cutoff frequency is determined using the circuit's component values.

### Steps

#### Components

- **Inductor (\(L = 10 \, \text{mH}\))**
- **Resistor (\(R = 1 \, \text{k}\Omega\))**
- Function Generator (AC Source)
- Oscilloscope

#### Step 1:

- Connect one terminal of the resistor to one terminal of the inductor, forming a series connection.

#### Step 2:

- Connect the positive terminal of the function generator to the free terminal of the resistor.
- Connect the negative terminal of the function generator to the breadboard’s ground rail.

#### Step 3:

- Connect the positive terminal of the oscilloscope to the free terminal of the inductor (output node).
- Connect the oscilloscope’s negative terminal to the ground rail.
- Ensure the ground terminals of the function generator and oscilloscope are connected to the same rail.

#### Step 4:

- Configure the function generator:
  - **Waveform:** Sine wave
  - **Amplitude:** \(5 \, \text{V}_{\text{peak-to-peak}}\)
  - **Frequency:** Sweep from \(10 \, \text{Hz}\) to \(10 \, \text{kHz}\)

#### Step 5:

- Start the simulation and observe the input and output waveforms on the oscilloscope.

### **Observations**

#### Low-Frequency Behavior (\(f < f_c\))

- At low frequencies (e.g., \(10 \, \text{Hz}\)):
  - The inductor exhibits low impedance, allowing current to pass through.
  - The output voltage across the inductor closely matches the input signal, indicating minimal attenuation.

#### High-Frequency Behavior (\(f > f_c\))

- At high frequencies (e.g., \(10 \, \text{kHz}\)):
  - The inductor’s impedance increases, limiting current flow.
  - The output voltage across the inductor decreases significantly, demonstrating attenuation.

#### Cutoff Frequency (\(f_c\))

- The transition from passing to attenuating signals occurs at the cutoff frequency:
  \[
  f_c = \frac{R}{2 \pi L} = \frac{1000}{2 \pi \cdot 0.01} \approx 15.9 \, \text{kHz}
  \]

### Results

1. **Frequency Response:**
   - Below \(f_c\), the filter passes signals with minimal attenuation.
   - Above \(f_c\), the filter attenuates signals progressively, as the inductor increasingly opposes high-frequency currents.

2. **Applications:**
   - RL low-pass filters are used in circuits where high-frequency noise needs to be removed or low-frequency signals need to be preserved, such as in audio systems or power supplies.

3. **Visualization:**
   - The oscilloscope clearly shows the decreasing output amplitude as the frequency increases, validating the filter’s functionality.

This experiment demonstrates the fundamental operation of RL low-pass filters:

- **Low Frequencies:** The inductor allows signals to pass, maintaining the output voltage.
- **High Frequencies:** The inductor blocks signals, reducing the output voltage.

Understanding the operation of RL low-pass filters is crucial for designing circuits in communication systems, audio processing, and signal conditioning. This practical demonstration reinforces the theoretical principles of frequency-dependent filtering in electronics.

### Low-Pass Filter Using Resistor and Inductor

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of a low-pass filter using a resistor and an inductor. The filter passes low frequencies and attenuates high frequencies.

1. Inductor: 10 mH
2. Resistor: \(1 \, \text{k}\Omega\)
3. Function Generator (AC Source)
4. Oscilloscope (to observe input and output signals)
5. Breadboard
6. Jumper Wires

### Steps

   - Place the resistor and inductor on the breadboard.

   - Connect one terminal of the resistor to one terminal of the inductor.
   - This series connection forms the low-pass filter.

   - Connect the positive terminal of the function generator to the free terminal of the resistor.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the function generator to the breadboard's ground rail.

   - Connect the positive terminal of the oscilloscope to the free terminal of the inductor (output node).
   - Connect the negative terminal of the oscilloscope to the ground rail.

   - Ensure the ground of the function generator and oscilloscope are connected to the same ground rail.

### Function Generator Settings

1. Waveform: Sine wave.
2. Amplitude: \(5 \, \text{V}_{\text{peak-to-peak}}\).
3. Frequency Sweep: Start at \(10 \, \text{Hz}\), gradually increase to \(10 \, \text{kHz}\).

### Procedure

   - Observe the input and output signals on the oscilloscope at different frequencies.

2. Low-Frequency Behavior:
   - At low frequencies (e.g., \(10 \, \text{Hz}\)), the inductor allows current to pass, and the output voltage across it closely follows the input signal.

3. High-Frequency Behavior:
   - At high frequencies (e.g., \(10 \, \text{kHz}\)), the inductor blocks current due to its increasing reactance, and the output voltage decreases significantly.

### Observations

- Low Frequencies: The output voltage matches the input, indicating minimal attenuation.
- High Frequencies: The output voltage approaches zero, showing significant attenuation.
- Cutoff Frequency: Use \(f_c = \frac{R}{2 \pi L}\) to calculate the transition point.
