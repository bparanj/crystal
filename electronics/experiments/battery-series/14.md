To show how two 9V batteries add up to create an 18V supply in Tinkercad, you can connect them in series.

By connecting two 9V batteries in series, you achieve a combined voltage of 18V, which you can confirm by measuring across the entire circuit. The circuit diagram is easier to see how everything is connected in series.

Step 7

Change the setting of the multimeter to measure current by selecting Amperage mode. Run the simulation.

You can see the current through the circuit is 6 amperes.

### Context and Problem

This experiment demonstrates how to combine two 9V batteries in series to achieve a higher voltage and how to measure both voltage and current in the resulting circuit. It highlights the principle of series connections in batteries, where individual voltages add up, and current remains uniform throughout the circuit.

### Terminology

- **Series Connection:** A configuration where the positive terminal of one battery connects to the negative terminal of another. This adds their voltages while maintaining the same current flow.
- **Multimeter:** A diagnostic tool used to measure electrical properties such as voltage, current, and resistance.
- **Voltage Measurement Mode:** A multimeter setting used to measure potential difference across two points.
- **Current Measurement Mode:** A multimeter setting used to measure the flow of electric charge (amperes) through a circuit.

### Steps

#### **Step 1:

Take two 9V batteries as the power sources for this experiment.

#### **Step 2: Set the Multimeter to Voltage Mode**

Configure the multimeter to measure voltage by selecting the appropriate setting. This setting is used to measure the potential difference across the circuit.

#### **Step 3: Connect the Batteries in Series**

- Connect the **positive terminal** of the first battery to the **negative terminal** of the second battery.
- This series connection adds the voltages of the two batteries while maintaining the same current flow.

#### **Step 4: Connect the Multimeter for Voltage Measurement**

- Attach the **negative terminal** of the first battery to the **negative probe** of the multimeter.
- Attach the **positive terminal** of the second battery to the **positive probe** of the multimeter.
- This setup ensures the multimeter measures the total voltage across both batteries.

#### **Step 5: Run the Simulation**

- Observe the multimeter reading, which should display approximately **18V**.
- This confirms the additive nature of voltages in series connections: \( 9V + 9V = 18V \).

#### **Step 6: Switch the Multimeter to Current Mode**

- Change the multimeter setting to measure current by selecting amperage mode.
- Ensure the multimeter is connected in series with the batteries and the circuit for accurate current measurement.

#### **Step 7: Run the Simulation Again**

- Observe the current displayed on the multimeter.
- In this case, the reading shows **6 amperes**, reflecting the current flowing uniformly through the series-connected batteries and circuit.

### Analysis

#### Voltage in Series Connections

In a series connection, the total voltage is the sum of the individual voltages. Connecting two 9V batteries in series results in a combined voltage of 18V, as confirmed by the multimeter reading.

#### Current in Series Connections

The current flowing through a series circuit remains the same at every point. In this setup, the current measured at 6 amperes reflects the total current supported by the circuit and batteries under load.

The multimeter validates these principles by:

1. **Measuring Total Voltage:** Confirming the additive property of series connections.
2. **Measuring Current:** Demonstrating the uniformity of current flow in series.

This experiment illustrates fundamental principles of series circuits: voltages add up, and current remains constant. By combining two 9V batteries, we achieve a higher supply voltage (18V), which can be used to power devices requiring higher potential differences. The multimeter validates these outcomes, reinforcing the importance of proper measurement techniques in understanding circuit behavior.
