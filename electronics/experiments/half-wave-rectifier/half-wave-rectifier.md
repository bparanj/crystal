Oscilloscopes to observe the input and output


1 k ohm resistor
Function generator:
Diode

Take a function generator and change the settings to: frequency: 500 Hz, amplitude: 5 volts, DC offset: 0, function: sine.

Take a oscilloscope. Change time per division to 2 ms.

Connect the oscilloscope to the function generator. This will be the input oscilloscope.

Connect the anode of the diode to the positive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Connect the cathode of the diode to one end of the 1 k ohm resistor.

Connect the other end of the resistor to the negative terminal in the power rails of the breadboard.

Take anothe oscilloscope to observe the output. Change the time per division to 2 ms.

Connect the output oscilloscope across the resistor.

Run the simulation. Input oscilloscope shows the sine wave form at 500 Hz. The output oscilloscope shows the sine wave form with the negative cycles removed. It stops at the horizontal line of the output oscilloscope.


Questions

Do we really need an LED when oscilloscopes are used to observe the input and output?

### **Half-Wave Rectification**

Demonstrate how a diode allows current to flow in only one direction by converting an AC signal into a pulsating DC signal through **half-wave rectification**.

### **Components**

1. **AC Power Source** (e.g., 5V AC)
2. **Diode** (e.g., 1N4007)
3. **LED** with appropriate resistor for current limiting

A diode acts as a one-way valve for current. In an AC circuit, it allows only the positive half-cycles of the waveform to pass through, blocking the negative half-cycles, creating a pulsating DC output.

### **Steps**

#### Step 1:

1. Connect one terminal of the AC power source to the **anode** of the diode.
2. Connect the **cathode** of the diode to one terminal of the resistor.

Turn on the AC power source.

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **Rectification:**
   - The diode converts AC to pulsating DC by blocking half of the waveform.
2. **Directionality of Current:**
   - The diodeâ€™s behavior shows that current flows only in one direction, a property of diodes.

   - Demonstrates the principle behind rectifiers used in power supplies.

### **Applications**

Rectifiers can be found in AC-to-DC conversion used in almost every electronic power supply.
