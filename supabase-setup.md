## Set Up Supabase Project

### Create a Supabase Account

Go to the [Supabase website](https://supabase.io/) and sign up or log in.

### Create a New Project

 Fill in the details like project name, database password, and region.

### Retrieve API Keys 

Once the project is set up, note down the `URL` and `anon public` API keys from the project's API settings.

### Nuxt and Keys

The `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, or Supabase anonymous key, is designed to be safe for client-side exposure. It's intended for use in scenarios where you need to interact with your Supabase project from frontend code, such as a web application. However, there are important considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Limited Permissions**: The anon key has limited permissions. It's typically used to perform operations that don't require elevated privileges, like authenticating users or accessing data that's meant to be publicly available. You should configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies in your Supabase project to strictly control what operations can be performed using this key.

2. **Secure Configuration**: Even though the anon key is meant for client-side use, it's crucial to set up your database and API permissions securely in Supabase. Ensure that sensitive data or operations are protected and not unintentionally exposed to unauthorized users.

3. **Use Cases**: The anon key is ideal for operations where user-specific permissions are not required. For instance, fetching public data, user registration, and login. For actions that require more permissions, such as modifying user-specific or sensitive data, you should use backend functions or server-side logic with a different set of credentials.

4. **Environment Variables**: When using the anon key in a Nuxt.js application, prefix it with `PUBLIC_` (e.g., `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) to make it available on the client side through the environment variables.

In summary, the Supabase anonymous key can be safely exposed on the client side, provided that you have correctly configured security and permission settings on your Supabase project. Always ensure that your RLS policies and other security settings are appropriately set up to protect sensitive data and operations.

Yes, if you intend to use the `SUPABASE_URL` in your client-side code in a Nuxt 3 application, you should prefix it with `PUBLIC_`. This is because Nuxt 3 automatically exposes environment variables with the `PUBLIC_` prefix to the client side. 

So, in your `.env` file, you would have something like this:

```env
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
```

And then in your Nuxt application, you can access it using `process.env.PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`. This will ensure that the Supabase URL is available in your client-side JavaScript, allowing you to interact with the Supabase services from the frontend.

Remember, the Supabase URL is not sensitive informationâ€”it's the endpoint of your Supabase project and is needed to initiate any interaction with Supabase from the client side. However, always ensure that any keys or tokens used alongside this URL are securely managed and have appropriate permissions set, especially when used in a client-side context.
