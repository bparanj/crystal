Let us discuss the integration flow for the scenario where Rails backend is API-only and the callback URL defined in Supabase dashboard redirects to a frontend Nuxt app. Here's how to handle user authentication and integration between Supabase, your Nuxt frontend, and the Rails API:

1. **Authentication with Supabase**:
   - Users authenticate using the Magic Link provided by Supabase.
   - After authentication, Supabase redirects users to the callback URL, which is now a route in your Nuxt application.

2. **Handling the Callback in Nuxt**:
   - In the Nuxt app, the callback route extracts the authentication token (usually a JWT) from the URL parameters.
   - The Nuxt app should then send this token to your Rails backend API for verification.

3. **Verifying Token in Rails API**:
   - Your Rails API receives the token from the Nuxt app.
   - The API then verifies the token's authenticity, which may involve decoding the JWT and optionally confirming its validity with Supabase.

4. **Identifying New or Existing Users in Rails API**:
   - Once the token is verified, extract the user's unique identifier (like an email or user ID) from it.
   - Check your Rails database to determine if this user already exists.
   - If the user is new, create a new record in your database. If they are existing, update their record as needed (like last login time).

5. **Creating a Session or Token for the Nuxt App**:
   - After verifying the user and ensuring they are correctly represented in your database, generate a session token or another form of authentication token in your Rails API.
   - This token will be different from the Supabase JWT and is used for subsequent authenticated requests from the Nuxt app to your Rails API.

6. **Sending the Token Back to Nuxt**:
   - Send this newly generated token back to the Nuxt application.
   - The Nuxt app can then store this token (in localStorage, cookies, or Vuex store) for authenticating future requests to the Rails API.

7. **Making Authenticated Requests**:
   - When the Nuxt app makes requests to your Rails API, it should include this token in the request headers.
   - Your Rails API uses this token to authenticate and authorize the requests.

8. **Security Considerations**:
   - Ensure secure transmission of tokens.
   - Implement appropriate measures to prevent CSRF attacks and token hijacking.

This approach enables the Nuxt frontend to handle the user interface and interaction, while the Rails API manages data, authentication verification, and session management. It leverages the strengths of both Supabase for user authentication and Rails for backend logic and data handling.
