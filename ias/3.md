## Risky Changes

Changes in managing infrastructure are considered risks for several reasons, reflecting the delicate balance between maintaining stability and pursuing improvement within IT environments. Here are the key factors that make changes risky:

1. **System Complexity**: Modern infrastructure, whether on-premises or cloud-based, is inherently complex. Changes to one component can have unforeseen effects on others due to the interdependencies within the system.

2. **Downtime and Disruptions**: Any modification, especially in critical systems, carries the risk of downtime or service disruptions. This can impact business operations, leading to financial losses and damage to reputation.

3. **Data Loss**: Incorrect changes to infrastructure can lead to data corruption or loss. Restoring lost data, if possible, is often time-consuming and costly.

4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Changes can inadvertently introduce security weaknesses or vulnerabilities. New software versions might contain unpatched security issues, or configuration changes could expose systems to attacks.

5. **Compliance Violations**: In regulated industries, changes to infrastructure must comply with legal and regulatory standards. Unauthorized or non-compliant changes can result in violations, fines, and legal repercussions.

6. **Resource Strain**: Implementing changes requires planning, testing, and deployment resources. Poorly managed changes can strain resources, diverting attention from other critical tasks or projects.

7. **Performance Issues**: Changes can affect system performance, sometimes in unexpected ways. Performance degradation can affect user experience and operational efficiency.

8. **Lack of Visibility**: Without comprehensive monitoring and documentation, the impact of changes can be difficult to predict or analyze. This lack of visibility increases the risk associated with changes.

9. **Testing Limitations**: Even with rigorous testing, it's challenging to replicate the full complexity of production environments in test scenarios. As a result, some risks might not be identified until after changes are implemented.

10. **Human Error**: Mistakes in planning, implementing, or rolling back changes are a significant risk factor. Even small errors can lead to major issues in complex systems.

### Mitigating Risks

To mitigate these risks, organizations implement change management processes and best practices, such as:
- **Thorough Planning and Review**: Evaluating the potential impact of changes before implementation.
- **Change Advisory Boards (CABs)**: Involving stakeholders in the decision-making process to assess risks and benefits.
- **Automated Testing and Deployment**: Using Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD pipelines to automate and standardize changes.
- **Rollback Plans**: Preparing plans to quickly revert changes if issues arise.
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Continuously monitoring infrastructure to quickly detect and address issues resulting from changes.

Effective change management balances the need for innovation and improvement with the imperative to maintain stable and secure operations, minimizing risks associated with changes in infrastructure management.
