## IaC Vocabulary

For a solid understanding of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and related fields, it's crucial to grasp the basic, lower-level concepts related to computing infrastructure. Here's a list of essential terms and their brief explanations:

1. **Physical Server**: A physical server is a traditional computing machine dedicated to running services or applications. It's a physical hardware device with components such as CPUs, memory, and storage devices installed in a data center.

2. **Virtual Server (Virtual Machine)**: A virtual server, or virtual machine (VM), is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications as if it were a physical machine but shares the underlying physical hardware with other VMs.

3. **Resource**: In the context of computing and IaC, a resource refers to any component of technology that can be managed, including hardware devices like servers and switches, software components like databases and applications, and more abstract entities like IP addresses and storage capacity.

4. **Container**: Containers package an application and all its dependencies together in a single unit that is isolated from other containers. This allows for consistent operation across different computing environments. Docker is a popular containerization platform.

5. **Cloud Computing**: The delivery of computing services—servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

6. **Hypervisor**: A piece of software, firmware, or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A host machine is the server that supports the hypervisor and VMs, and the guest machines are the VMs themselves.

7. **Networking**: In computing, networking refers to the practice of connecting computers and other devices together to share resources (like files and printers) and communication. Key components include routers, switches, and firewalls.

8. **Storage**: The data storage devices used in computing, which can include physical hard drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and network-attached storage (NAS) devices, as well as cloud storage services.

9. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing inside a computer. It executes instructions from both hardware and software.

10. **Memory (RAM)**: Random Access Memory (RAM) is the hardware in a computing device where the operating system, application programs, and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device's processor.

11. **Operating System (OS)**: The software that manages the hardware and software resources of a computer or device. Common examples include Windows, Linux, and macOS for computers and servers, and iOS and Android for mobile devices.

12. **Load Balancer**: A device or software that distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers, increasing capacity and reliability of applications.

13. **Scalability**: The ability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.

14. **High Availability**: The approach to building computing systems that minimizes downtime and ensures continuous operability. This often involves redundancy and failover mechanisms.

Understanding these fundamental concepts is critical for anyone working with or learning about Infrastructure as Code, as they form the basic building blocks upon which more complex systems and architectures are built.
