Functional composition is a fundamental concept in functional programming where you create new functions by combining two or more existing functions. The output of one function becomes the input to the next. This allows for building complex operations from simpler ones, making code more modular and easier to understand.

### Simple Explanation:

Imagine you have two machines in a factory line:

- Machine A takes some raw material and shapes it.
- Machine B then takes that shaped material and paints it.

Functional composition is like connecting Machine A to Machine B so that the output from A (the shaped material) automatically goes into B (to get painted). The combined operation of shaping and painting is now a single, streamlined process.

### Code Example in JavaScript:

Let's say we have two simple functions:

1. **Double** - This function takes a number and multiplies it by 2.
2. **Increment** - This function takes a number and adds 1 to it.

We want to compose these functions so that we first double a number and then increment the result.

```javascript
// Define the first function
function double(x) {
  return x * 2;
}

// Define the second function
function increment(x) {
  return x + 1;
}

// Functional composition
function doubleThenIncrement(x) {
  return increment(double(x));
}

// Usage
console.log(doubleThenIncrement(3)); // Outputs: 7
```

In this example, `doubleThenIncrement` is our composed function. For an input of 3, `double` first turns it into 6, and then `increment` changes that 6 into 7. 

### Another Approach Using Higher-Order Functions:

Some functional programming languages or libraries offer built-in methods to compose functions more elegantly. Here's how you might do it in JavaScript using the `compose` function from a library like Ramda, or creating a simple compose utility:

```javascript
// Simple compose utility
function compose(f, g) {
  return function(x) {
    return f(g(x));
  }
}

// Using the compose utility
const doubleThenIncrement = compose(increment, double);

console.log(doubleThenIncrement(3)); // Outputs: 7
```

This `compose` function takes two functions `f` and `g`, and returns a new function that, when called with an argument `x`, first applies `g` to `x` and then applies `f` to the result. The order is right-to-left: `double` happens first, and `increment` follows.

Functional composition is powerful because it promotes code reuse, improves readability, and helps maintain a clear separation of concerns in your programs.

## Unix Pipes

Yes, you're absolutely right! The concept of functional composition in programming is indeed quite similar to using pipes (`|`) in Unix/Linux command lines. Both mechanisms allow for the output of one operation to become the input of the next, facilitating a seamless flow of data through a series of transformations or processes.

### Unix/Linux Pipes:

In Unix/Linux, a pipe connects the standard output (stdout) of one command to the standard input (stdin) of another. This allows you to chain commands together in a concise and flexible manner. For example:

```bash
cat myfile.txt | grep "search term" | sort
```

In this command line:

- `cat myfile.txt` reads the content of `myfile.txt`.
- `grep "search term"` filters lines containing "search term".
- `sort` sorts the filtered lines alphabetically.

Each command operates on the output of the previous one, passing data seamlessly down the pipeline.

### Functional Composition:

Similarly, in functional programming, functional composition allows you to chain functions together, where the output of one function becomes the input to the next. This can be seen in languages like JavaScript, Haskell, or Elixir, among others.

### JavaScript Example with Functional Composition:

```javascript
const scream = (str) => str.toUpperCase();
const exclaim = (str) => `${str}!`;
const repeat = (str) => `${str} ${str}`;

// Composing the functions
const compose = (...fns) => (x) => fns.reduceRight((v, f) => f(v), x);

// Using compose to chain the functions
const makeLoudAndRepeat = compose(repeat, exclaim, scream);

console.log(makeLoudAndRepeat("hello"));  // Outputs: "HELLO! HELLO!"
```

### Comparison:

- **Flexibility**: Both Unix pipes and functional composition offer a flexible way to build complex operations from simpler, reusable components.
- **Readability**: They both improve readability by breaking down operations into smaller, understandable parts.
- **Data Flow**: The emphasis on data flow (from one operation to the next) is central to both concepts, promoting a clear and logical progression of data transformations.

Thus, the analogy between Unix pipes and functional composition in programming is quite apt. Both concepts leverage the power of chaining operations to process data efficiently and elegantly.

## Prompt for Copilot

"Using a JavaScript composition library, create a function that combines the functionalities of three separate functions into a single operation. The functions to combine are:

1. `scream`: Converts a string to uppercase.
2. `exclaim`: Adds an exclamation mark to the end of a string.
3. `repeat`: Repeats the string twice with a space in between.

Write the composed function using the composition library to process an input string through these three functions in sequence. The goal is to first scream (uppercase) the input, then add an exclamation mark, and finally repeat the modified string twice. Provide an example of using this composed function with the input 'hello'."
