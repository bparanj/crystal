# Thoughtworks-Style Tech Radar

## 1. **Techniques**

### ADOPT

- **Model Distillation for LLM Efficiency**  
  *Why:* Distillation (e.g. from a larger foundation model to a smaller specialized model) is consistently yielding surprising performance improvements. Multiple researchers (e.g. @jxmnop) have shown that smaller distilled models can match or exceed their teacher model in certain benchmarks, while dramatically reducing compute requirements.

- **Speculative Decoding**  
  *Why:* Inspired by GPU upscaling analogies (e.g. DLSS in gaming), speculative decoding lowers computational load by generating partial next-token predictions more efficiently. This technique can reduce inference latency without sacrificing much accuracy.

### TRIAL

- **Stick-Breaking (Segmented) Attention**  
  *Why:* This new attention mechanism aims at better length generalization and scaling. Trials suggest that it can handle longer sequences more gracefully. Still under active research (e.g. @arohan), but promising for large context windows in LLMs.

- **Agentic Document Workflows**  
  *Why:* Approaches that embed “agentic” capabilities (LangChain-like retrieval, automated document transformations, etc.) are evolving. LlamaIndex’s new “agentic workflows” illustrate how LLMs can orchestrate multi-step tasks using documents in various formats, but usage patterns must still be tested in real production environments.

### ASSESS

- **Eye/Gaze Detection in Vision Models**  
  *Why:* Moondream’s new gaze detection reveals significant community interest in applying eye-tracking to video or real-time scenarios. It raises questions around privacy/surveillance vs. legitimate uses (assistive devices, user-interaction). Early adopters are experimenting with OpenCV scripts and custom pipelines.

- **Self-Attention for Physical AI**  
  *Why:* Several researchers predict 2025 as “the year of Physical AI” (@addock_brett). Physical AI merges robotics with advanced neural architectures. While it is currently a nascent domain, it could expand quickly once hardware constraints and training optimizations converge.

### HOLD

- **Extremely High Weight Decay for LLM Regularization**  
  *Why:* Some teams are experimenting with large weight-decay values (like 0.1) to stabilize or regularize large models. However, there are widespread reports that such extremes can lead to “model meltdown.” We recommend holding off on this approach until more robust, nuanced techniques are validated.

---

## 2. **Tools**

### ADOPT

- **LangChain for LLM-Powered Pipelines**  
  *Why:* LangChain’s agentic abilities and tool integration are quickly becoming standard for prototyping. The ecosystem is large, and the approach lowers the barrier to building data-centric LLM applications (semantic search, pipeline orchestration, etc.). 

- **ComfyUI for Enhanced AnimateDiff**  
  *Why:* In the Stable Diffusion community, ComfyUI is lauded for combining AnimateDiff with IP-Adapter to yield better quality in video generation. It offers a modular, node-based interface that fosters rapid experimentation in diffusion-based workflows.

### TRIAL

- **Transformers.js with WebGPU**  
  *Why:* Running LLMs or reasoning tasks 100% in-browser is an exciting proposition for privacy and offline capability. Early adopters have reported widely varying performance, which depends heavily on local hardware. Still in early days but worth prototyping if browser-based AI is in scope.

- **MLX by @awnihannun**  
  *Why:* MLX (a rumored extension or framework) promises cross-language and platform portability, plus improved function exporting from Python to C++. While it’s not yet a mainstream standard, early results show promise for organizations wanting frictionless multi-platform ML code.

### ASSESS

- **vLLM for MacOS**  
  *Why:* vLLM’s nightly builds now include native MacOS support. This is beneficial for local inference and dev setups, but real-world performance vs. Linux GPU-based setups remains an open question.

- **OpenRouter**  
  *Why:* OpenRouter aims to simplify usage of multiple LLM backends (e.g. Gemini, O1, etc.) in a single UI or API. The recent hackathon and sponsor involvement indicate momentum, but frequent UI slowdowns beyond 1k lines of chat history highlight immaturity. Evaluate carefully for your environment.

### HOLD

- **AnimateDiff Standalone**  
  *Why:* The AnimateDiff pipeline alone has been criticized for inconsistent or low-quality video outputs. ComfyUI-based combos are showing better results. Adopting AnimateDiff in isolation might not provide the best user experience—wait for further improvements or a more stable integration path.

## 3. **Platforms**

### ADOPT

- **Moondream 2B Model (Structured Output + Gaze Detection)**  
  *Why:* Moondream’s “small, light, fast” approach sets a new efficiency frontier in VRAM usage. Early adoptors praise the 2B parameter sweet spot for local or cost-conscious inference. The added structured output capability plus gaze detection are intriguing for many use cases.

- **NVIDIA DIGITS or “Project Digits”**  
  *Why:* NVIDIA’s upcoming $3,000 AI “desktop supercomputer” (a.k.a. DIGITS) could drastically lower the barrier to local AI development. While it doesn’t truly replace HPC-scale clusters, it could “democratize” local deployment for mid-size teams.

### TRIAL

- **Qdrant for Vector Search**  
  *Why:* Qdrant has gained mindshare as a vector database for semantic search and embeddings-based retrieval. Though mature enough for many production uses, it’s still a challenger among well-established tools (e.g. Pinecone, Weaviate). Trial if your team wants straightforward vector similarity with minimal overhead.

- **AMD GPUs for Local LLM**  
  *Why:* Some discussions highlight AMD’s improved capabilities (RX 7900 series) for local stable diffusion or LLM tasks. However, issues like kernel panics on Linux, driver quirks, and suboptimal frameworks remain. AMD is a good alternative in theory, but evaluate thoroughly before committing.

### ASSESS

- **Microsoft's Swarm of AI Agents**  
  *Why:* The Microsoft CEO’s vision of “each worker managing hundreds of thousands of AI agents” is eye-catching but unproven. This approach might lead to complex orchestration overhead and questionable ROI. Keep watch, but avoid large-scale deployment until there is clearer success evidence.

- **Biden Administration AI Chip Export Controls**  
  *Why:* New US restrictions on AI chip exports to certain countries (including some US allies) could directly affect GPU supply chains (NVIDIA, AMD, etc.). Organizations reliant on global HPC resources should monitor this area closely to see if export rules disrupt hardware sourcing or partner collaborations.

### HOLD

- **DALL·E 3 Production Usage**  
  *Why:* Recent posts suggest DALL·E may have been deprioritized, overshadowed by other image models like Midjourney or Imagen. If you rely on top-tier photo-realistic outputs, consider alternative or updated solutions until OpenAI clarifies whether DALL·E remains a priority.

---

## 4. **Languages & Frameworks**

### ADOPT

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for Fine-Tuning**  
  *Why:* LoRA is fast becoming a de facto method to adapt large base models on custom data while saving VRAM and compute. Key best practices (e.g. always merging with 16-bit bases) have been widely shared, making it a stable technique to adopt.

### TRIAL

- **Triton for GPU Kernels**  
  *Why:* Triton (from OpenAI) aims to simplify writing custom GPU kernels in Python. Promising results in HPC and ML (faster matrix multiplies, etc.) show it can outperform stock PyTorch in some cases. Still immature, so approach with caution.

- **Meta’s rStar-Math**  
  *Why:* rStar-Math significantly boosted Qwen2.5 and Phi3-mini’s MATH performance—impressive for academic or competition tasks. However, it may be too specialized for broad production usage. Trial if advanced math reasoning is a top priority.

### ASSESS

- **Chain-of-Thought + “Meta Prompting”**  
  *Why:* Techniques like meta-prompting and chain-of-thought can enhance LLM reasoning. Nonetheless, the best practices for controlling hallucinations and run-on token costs remain fluid. Assess feasibility in sandboxed or specialized domains to avoid unexpected costs or confusion.

- **Qwen’s New Chat Framework**  
  *Why:* Alibaba’s Qwen is rolling out new chat UIs and frameworks, including image-based input. They show great ambition to compete with established LLM ecosystems. Evaluate if you need a multilingual or enterprise-China solution.

### HOLD

- **High-Precision HPC Schedules for LLM Pretraining**  
  *Why:* Setting up HPC for LLM pretraining (7B+ parameters) is complex—frequent OOM stalls, large token contexts, distributed frameworks, etc. If you lack the specialized staff or robust budget, hold off until HPC scheduling solutions become more stable or widely documented.
