Here's a sample Ansible playbook tailored for installing and configuring Fail2ban on Ubuntu 22.04:

**Filename: fail2ban-playbook.yml**

```yaml
---
- name: Install and configure Fail2ban
  hosts: all  # Replace 'all' with your specific host group
  become: true  # Required for package installation and service management

  tasks:
    - name: Install Fail2ban
      apt:
        name: fail2ban
        state: present

    - name: Copy default Fail2ban configuration (for backup)
      copy:
        src: /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf
        dest: /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf.backup
        remote_src: yes  

    - name: Create Fail2ban local configuration
      template:
        src: jail.local.j2  # You'll need to create this template
        dest: /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: 0644

    - name: Ensure Fail2ban service is enabled and running
      service:
        name: fail2ban
        state: started
        enabled: true
```

**Important Parts**

* **Hosts:** Update the `hosts` line to target the servers where you want Fail2ban.
* **`jail.local.j2`** (Template): You need to create a Jinja2 template file named `jail.local.j2`. This will contain your custom Fail2ban jail configurations. See a basic example below.

**Example `jail.local.j2` template**

```jinja2
[DEFAULT]
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1  # Add your trusted IPs
bantime = 86400  # Ban for 1 day 
findtime = 600   # Find suspicious attempts within 10 minutes
maxretry = 3     # Allow 3 retries before banning

[sshd]
enabled = true
```

**How to Use**

1.  **Create the `jail.local.j2` file:** Populate it with your desired Fail2ban jail configurations. Place it in a `templates` folder next to your playbook.
2.  **Run the playbook:** `ansible-playbook fail2ban-playbook.yml`

**Key Points**

* **Customization:** The key to this playbook is the `jail.local.j2` template. Edit it extensively to define the jails and protection rules you want.
* **Roles:** For larger setups, consider using a dedicated Ansible role (e.g., from Ansible Galaxy) for more organized management of Fail2ban configuration.
