Disabling root login and password-based SSH authentication are common security practices for Linux servers, including Ubuntu 22.04. When you disable these, you typically rely on SSH key-based authentication for user accounts. A PEM file (Privacy Enhanced Mail) is often used in this context as it contains a private key for SSH key-based authentication.

### SSH Key-Based Authentication

When you disable root login and password authentication, you can still log in using an SSH key pair (the PEM file you mentioned is part of this mechanism). The process involves:

1. **Generating an SSH Key Pair**: If you haven't already, generate an SSH key pair on your local machine. The private key (`.pem` or `.id_rsa` file) stays on your local machine, while the public key (`.pub` file) gets uploaded to the server.

2. **Uploading the Public Key**: Place the public key in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file of the user account you intend to use on the Ubuntu server.

3. **Configuring SSH**: Ensure your SSH configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) on the Ubuntu server is set to allow key-based authentication and disallow password authentication and root login. Relevant settings include:

   ```
   PasswordAuthentication no
   PermitRootLogin no
   ```

4. **Logging In**: Use the private key to log in to the server with a command like:

   ```bash
   ssh -i /path/to/private_key.pem username@server_ip
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/private_key.pem` with the path to your PEM file, `username` with your user account on the server, and `server_ip` with the IP address of your Ubuntu server.

### Important Considerations

- **User Account**: Before disabling root login, ensure you have created another user account with `sudo` privileges. This account will be used for all administrative tasks on the server.

- **SSH Configuration**: Carefully edit the SSH configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) and restart the SSH service (`sudo systemctl restart sshd`). Incorrect configuration could lock you out of the server.

- **PEM File Permissions**: Your private key (PEM file) must be kept secure. Set its permissions to be readable only by you:

  ```bash
  chmod 400 /path/to/private_key.pem
  ```

- **Backup Access**: Always have a backup access method in place before making significant changes to the SSH configuration. For cloud instances, this could be through the cloud provider's console or recovery mode options.

By following these steps, you ensure secure access to your Ubuntu 22.04 server using SSH key-based authentication, while disabling less secure methods like password authentication and direct root login.

To configure an Ubuntu 22.04 server to disable root login and password authentication while still allowing SSH access using a PEM file (SSH key-based authentication), you can use an Ansible playbook. This setup enhances server security by disabling less secure authentication methods.

Below is an example playbook that accomplishes this. It assumes you have already copied the public SSH key to the server for a non-root user, which you will use for SSH access.

### Example Ansible Playbook

```yaml
---
- name: Secure SSH Configuration
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Disable root SSH login
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        regexp: '^PermitRootLogin'
        line: 'PermitRootLogin no'
        state: present
      notify: restart sshd

    - name: Disable password authentication
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        regexp: '^PasswordAuthentication'
        line: 'PasswordAuthentication no'
        state: present
      notify: restart sshd

    - name: Ensure SSH directory exists for non-root user
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: "/home/{{ ansible_user }}/ssh"
        state: directory
        owner: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        group: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        mode: '0700'

    - name: Add authorized key for non-root user
      ansible.builtin.authorized_key:
        user: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        state: present
        key: "{{ lookup('file', '/path/to/your/public_key.pub') }}"
      when: ansible_user != 'root'

  handlers:
    - name: restart sshd
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: ssh
        state: restarted
```

### Playbook Breakdown

- **Disable root SSH login**: This task updates `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to set `PermitRootLogin` to `no`, disabling root login over SSH.
- **Disable password authentication**: Similarly, it sets `PasswordAuthentication` to `no` to require SSH key-based authentication.
- **Ensure SSH directory exists**: Creates the `.ssh` directory for the specified non-root user if it doesnâ€™t already exist, ensuring the correct permissions.
- **Add authorized key**: Adds a specified public SSH key to the non-root user's authorized keys, allowing key-based SSH login. Replace `/path/to/your/public_key.pub` with the actual path to your public SSH key file.
- **Handlers - restart sshd**: This handler restarts the SSH service to apply the configuration changes.

### Important Notes

- **SSH Access**: Before running this playbook, ensure that you have SSH access to the server using the non-root user and that your public SSH key is correctly installed. This is critical because, after applying these changes, password-based and root logins will be disabled.
- **Ansible User Variable**: Replace `{{ ansible_user }}` with your specific non-root username if not set as a variable elsewhere in your Ansible configurations.
- **Public Key Path**: Change `/path/to/your/public_key.pub` to the actual path of your public SSH key on the machine running Ansible.

### Running the Playbook

To run this playbook, save it to a file (e.g., `secure_ssh.yml`) and execute it with the `ansible-playbook` command, specifying your inventory:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i your_inventory_file secure_ssh.yml
```

Ensure that you test this configuration on a non-critical system first to verify that you maintain SSH access as expected. Adjustments may be necessary depending on your specific server setup and SSH configuration.
