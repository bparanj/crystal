To check if Redis is installed and working from the terminal, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Check Redis Service Status**

First, check if the Redis service is running on your system. You can use the `systemctl` command on systems using `systemd`:

```sh
systemctl status redis
```

This command will show you the current status of the Redis service. If it's active and running, you're good to proceed. If not, you might need to start it using:

```sh
sudo systemctl start redis
```

### 2. **Connect to Redis Using the CLI**

Redis comes with a command-line interface (CLI) tool that you can use to interact directly with Redis. To check if Redis is working, you can connect to the Redis server using this tool:

```sh
redis-cli
```

Once connected, you can test if Redis is operational by setting a key and getting its value back:

```redis
set testkey "Hello, Redis!"
get testkey
```

If Redis is working correctly, the `get` command should return `"Hello, Redis!"`.

### 3. **Check Redis Version**

You can also check the installed version of Redis to ensure it's installed correctly. Run:

```sh
redis-server --version
```

This command will display the version of Redis installed on your system, indicating that Redis is indeed installed.

### 4. **Ping Redis**

Another quick way to check if Redis is operational is to use the `PING` command from the `redis-cli`:

```sh
redis-cli ping
```

If Redis is running, you should receive a response:

```
PONG
```

### 5. **Checking Redis Ports**

Lastly, you can check if Redis is listening on its default port (6379) or any other configured port using the `netstat` or `ss` command:

```sh
netstat -lnp | grep redis
# Or using `ss` if netstat is not available
ss -lnp | grep redis
```

This command will show if Redis is running and listening on the expected port.

These steps should help you verify if Redis is installed and working correctly from the terminal.
