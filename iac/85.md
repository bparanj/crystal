To create a simple Ruby program that uses Puma to serve a web page saying "Hello Puma", follow these steps. This program will involve creating a basic Rack application that Puma can run.

### Step 1: Install Required Gems

First, you need to install the `puma` gem, and it's a good practice to manage your application's dependencies using a `Gemfile`. Create a `Gemfile` in your project directory with the following content:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'puma'
```

Then, run `bundle install` to install Puma.

### Step 2: Create the Rack Application

Rack provides a minimal interface between webservers supporting Ruby and Ruby frameworks. Create a file named `config.ru` in your project directory. This file will define the Rack application:

```ruby
app = Proc.new do |env|
  ['200', {'Content-Type' => 'text/html'}, ['Hello Puma']]
end

run app
```

This simple application responds to every request with a `200 OK` status and the body "Hello Puma".

### Step 3: Run Your Application with Puma

With the `config.ru` file in place, you can start your application with Puma. Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
bundle exec puma
```

Puma will start, and you can access your application by navigating to `http://localhost:9292` in your web browser. You should see the "Hello Puma" message.

### Explanation:

- **Gemfile**: This file declares the Puma dependency for your project.
- **config.ru**: This is a Rack configuration file that describes how to run your Ruby application with Rack-compatible servers like Puma.
- **bundle exec puma**: This command starts the Puma server with the settings defined in `config.ru`.

This setup creates a minimal Ruby application that uses Puma as its web server. Puma serves a simple web page with the text "Hello Puma", demonstrating how to get a Ruby application up and running with Puma.

This is for image testing purposes. Caddy will proxy to this process. This will be replace by a Rails app during the deployment of Rails app.
