Running a Rails application in production on an Ubuntu server involves a combination of system libraries, language runtimes, and utilities to ensure smooth deployment and operation. Here's a list of 20 essential Ubuntu packages and their purpose, which collectively provide a strong foundation for hosting a Rails application in production:

1. **`ruby-full`**: Installs Ruby, the programming language used by Rails. Essential for running Rails applications.

2. **`nodejs`**: Provides the JavaScript runtime, which is necessary for compiling JavaScript assets in Rails applications.

3. **`yarn`**: A package manager for JavaScript, used to manage front-end dependencies in Rails applications.

4. **`build-essential`**: Includes essential tools for building and compiling software from source, including GCC compiler, make, and other utilities.

5. **`libssl-dev`**: Development libraries for SSL, needed to enable HTTPS support in your application through OpenSSL.

6. **`libyaml-dev`**: Libraries for YAML, a data serialization format used in many Rails configurations and databases.

7. **`libreadline-dev`**: Development libraries for readline, providing a set of functions for facilitating user input.

8. **`zlib1g-dev`**: Compression library, required for working with compressed data and file formats.

9. **`libncurses5-dev`**: Libraries for terminal handling, required for certain console-based operations and interfaces.

10. **`libffi-dev`**: Provides a portable Foreign Function Interface library, necessary for Ruby versions and some gems to properly interface with C functions.

11. **`libgdbm-dev`**: Provides support for the GDBM database library, which is a set of database routines that use extensible hashing.

12. **`libpq-dev`**: Development libraries for PostgreSQL, necessary if you're using PostgreSQL as your database.

13. **`libsqlite3-dev`**: Development libraries for SQLite, necessary if you're using SQLite as your database in development or production.

14. **`nginx`** or **`apache2`**: Web servers that can serve static files and proxy requests to your Rails app. Nginx is more commonly used with Rails for its lightweight and high-performance capabilities.

15. **`redis-server`**: In-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. Essential for action cable and caching in Rails.

16. **`git`**: Version control system, necessary for deploying your Rails application from version control repositories.

17. **`imagemagick`**: A software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images, used by many Rails applications for image processing.

18. **`curl`**: Command-line tool and library for transferring data with URLs. Useful for health checks and interacting with web services.

19. **`gnupg2`**: GNU Privacy Guard, a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard. Often required for verifying signatures and managing secure software installations.

20. **`certbot`** (from the EFF, optional but recommended): Automatically obtain and renew SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt. Essential for secure HTTPS communication.

To install these packages, you would typically run a command like:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ruby-full nodejs yarn build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev libpq-dev libsqlite3-dev nginx redis-server git imagemagick curl gnupg2 certbot
```

This command installs the necessary packages to get a Rails application up and running on an Ubuntu server. Depending on your specific application's requirements (such as specific database engines or caching solutions), you may need additional packages or configurations.
