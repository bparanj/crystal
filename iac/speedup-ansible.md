Speeding up Ansible playbook runs, especially on a powerful instance like `c5.4xlarge`, involves optimizing both your playbook's structure and Ansible's execution environment. Here are several strategies:

### 1. **Parallel Execution**

- **Forks**: Increase the number of parallel tasks Ansible executes by adjusting the `forks` configuration in `ansible.cfg` or by using the `-f` command-line option. For a `c5.4xlarge` instance, you can significantly increase this value.

  ```ini
  [defaults]
  forks = 50
  ```

### 2. **Pipelining**

Enable pipelining to reduce the number of SSH operations required to execute a command. This is set in `ansible.cfg`:

```ini
[ssh_connection]
pipelining = True
```

### 3. **Fact Gathering**

Minimize or optimize fact gathering:

- **Disable**: If not needed, disable it at the playbook level or use `gather_facts: no`.
- **Custom Facts**: Use `setup` module with `gather_subset` to collect only required facts.

### 4. **Task Efficiency**

- **Handlers**: Use handlers for restarting services instead of doing it in tasks, so they are only restarted once.
- **Commands and Scripts**: Use Ansible modules instead of shell or command modules where possible. Modules are more efficient and idempotent.
- **Conditionals**: Use conditionals to skip tasks that don't need to be run.

### 5. **Mitigate Loops**

- **Batching**: Where possible, batch operations together rather than looping through them one by one.
- **`async` and `poll`**: For long-running tasks, use asynchronous actions with `async` and `poll` to prevent Ansible from waiting on the task to complete.

### 6. **Profile Your Playbooks**

- **Verbose Mode**: Run playbooks in verbose mode (`ansible-playbook -vvv`) to identify slow tasks.
- **Ansible Callback Plugin**: Use the `profile_tasks` callback plugin to get detailed timing information for each task.

```ini
[defaults]
callback_whitelist = profile_tasks
```

### 7. **Use Static Imports Over Dynamic Includes**

- Dynamic includes (`include_tasks`) are evaluated at runtime, which can slow down execution. Where determinism is not required, prefer static imports (`import_tasks`).

### 8. **Optimize Template Files**

- If using templates, ensure they are as simple as possible. Complex Jinja2 templates can slow down task execution.

### 9. **Ansible Pull**

- For certain use cases, consider using `ansible-pull` where appropriate, which can reduce the overhead of coordinating many managed nodes from a single control node.

### 10. **Infrastructure**

- **Networking**: Ensure low-latency, high-bandwidth networking between the Ansible control node and managed nodes.
- **SSD**: Use SSDs for the Ansible control node to speed up playbook parsing and temporary file management.

Implementing these strategies should significantly improve the performance of your Ansible playbooks, especially when leveraging the computational resources of a `c5.4xlarge` instance.
