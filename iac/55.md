Create Ansible playbook for:
 - SSH hardening - prevent password login, change the default default ssh port and prevent root login

To create an Ansible playbook for SSH hardening, including preventing password login, changing the default SSH port, and preventing root login, you can follow this template. This playbook makes changes to the SSH daemon configuration, typically found in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

### Ansible Playbook: SSH Hardening

```yaml
---
- name: Harden SSH Configuration
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    ssh_port: 2222 # New SSH port (change as needed)

  tasks:
    - name: Prevent password authentication
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        regexp: '^#?PasswordAuthentication'
        line: 'PasswordAuthentication no'
        state: present

    - name: Change default SSH port
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        regexp: '^#?Port'
        line: 'Port {{ ssh_port }}'
        state: present

    - name: Prevent root login via SSH
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        regexp: '^#?PermitRootLogin'
        line: 'PermitRootLogin no'
        state: present

    - name: Restart SSH service to apply changes
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: sshd
        state: restarted
```

### Explanation

- **SSH Port**: This playbook uses a variable `ssh_port` to define the new SSH port. Change `2222` to your preferred port number.
- **Prevent Password Authentication**: This task updates the `sshd_config` file to disable password authentication, requiring SSH keys for login.
- **Change Default SSH Port**: Modifies the SSH port to the value specified in `ssh_port`. This can help reduce the volume of automated attacks.
- **Prevent Root Login**: Disables the ability for the root user to log in directly over SSH, a common security practice.
- **Restart SSH Service**: Applies the changes by restarting the SSH daemon. Note that if you're connected over SSH while running this playbook, changing the port or disabling password authentication could disconnect you.

### Usage

1. Save this playbook to a file (e.g., `ssh_hardening.yml`).
2. Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook ssh_hardening.yml
```

### Important Considerations

- **SSH Port**: Before changing the SSH port, ensure the new port is allowed through the firewall and is not being used by other services.
- **Remote Access**: If running this playbook remotely via SSH, be cautious with changes that could lock you out, such as changing the SSH port or disabling password authentication without setting up key-based authentication first.
- **Backup**: Always backup your configuration files before making automated changes.

This playbook provides a foundational approach to SSH hardening. Depending on your specific requirements, you may want to implement additional security measures.
