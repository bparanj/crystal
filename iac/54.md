Provide instructions for serving a Goss health endpoint (JSON) when Packer is used with Ansible to create an AMI

To serve a Goss health endpoint that outputs JSON, you can integrate Goss with your Packer and Ansible setup to create an AWS AMI. This involves setting up Goss to run as a service and configuring it to serve a health check endpoint. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Install Goss in Your AMI with Packer and Ansible

First, ensure Goss is installed on your AMI. You can do this using Ansible within your Packer template.

#### Ansible Task to Install Goss:

Add the following task to your Ansible playbook used by Packer:

```yaml
- name: Download and install Goss
  get_url:
    url: "https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss/releases/download/v0.3.16/goss-linux-amd64"
    dest: "/usr/local/bin/goss"
    mode: '0755'
```

### 2. Create Goss Tests

Define your health check tests in a `goss.yaml` file. For a simple HTTP service running on port 80, your test might look like this:

```yaml
port:
  tcp:80:
    listening: true
    ip: "0.0.0.0"
```

### 3. Serve Goss Health Endpoint

To continuously serve Goss tests results through an HTTP endpoint, you'll use `goss serve`. This command starts a web server that provides test results in JSON format at a specified endpoint.

#### Creating a systemd Service for Goss

1. **Create a systemd service file for Goss**. This will allow Goss to run as a service and automatically start on boot. Create a file named `goss.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/` with the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Goss server

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/goss -g /path/to/your/goss.yaml serve --format json --listen-addr :8080
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Replace `/path/to/your/goss.yaml` with the actual path to your `goss.yaml` file. Adjust the listen address and port as needed.

2. **Enable and start the Goss service**:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable goss.service
sudo systemctl start goss.service
```

### 4. Configure Security Group to Allow Access to the Health Endpoint

Ensure your AWS Security Group allows inbound traffic on the port Goss is serving (e.g., 8080).

### 5. Accessing the Health Endpoint

After launching an instance from your AMI, you can access the Goss health endpoint:

```
curl http://<Instance-IP>:8080/healthz
```

This command should return the results of your Goss tests in JSON format.

### Integration with Packer

In your Packer template, ensure you have steps to:

- Install Goss using Ansible.
- Copy your `goss.yaml` and the systemd service file to the appropriate locations on the AMI.
- Enable and start the Goss service, either through Ansible or a `shell` provisioner.

This setup ensures that instances launched from your AMI will automatically run Goss as a service, providing a JSON health endpoint for your applications.

## Playbook for Health Check Setup

To create and manage a Goss service to serve health endpoints) into an Ansible playbook task, follow these steps. This playbook will:

1. Install Goss.
2. Deploy a `goss.yaml` file with your health checks.
3. Create a systemd service for Goss to serve health check results via HTTP.
4. Start and enable the Goss service.

### Ansible Playbook

```yaml
---
- name: Set up Goss for health endpoint serving
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    goss_version: "v0.3.16"
    goss_install_path: "/usr/local/bin/goss"
    goss_test_file_path: "/etc/goss.yaml"
    goss_listen_addr: ":8080"
    goss_systemd_service_name: "goss"

  tasks:
    - name: Download and install Goss
      get_url:
        url: "https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss/releases/download/{{ goss_version }}/goss-linux-amd64"
        dest: "{{ goss_install_path }}"
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Deploy Goss test configuration
      copy:
        content: |
          port:
            tcp:80:
              listening: true
              ip: "0.0.0.0"
        dest: "{{ goss_test_file_path }}"
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644'

    - name: Create Goss systemd service file
      copy:
        content: |
          [Unit]
          Description=Goss server

          [Service]
          ExecStart={{ goss_install_path }} -g {{ goss_test_file_path }} serve --format json --listen-addr {{ goss_listen_addr }}
          Restart=always

          [Install]
          WantedBy=multi-user.target
        dest: "/etc/systemd/system/{{ goss_systemd_service_name }}.service"
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644'
      notify: Reload systemd and restart Goss

  handlers:
    - name: Reload systemd and restart Goss
      systemd:
        daemon_reload: yes
      notify: Restart Goss

    - name: Restart Goss
      systemd:
        name: "{{ goss_systemd_service_name }}"
        state: restarted
        enabled: yes
```

### Explanation

- **Variables**: Defined at the beginning for easy customization.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Download and install Goss**: Fetches the Goss binary and places it in `/usr/local/bin`.
  - **Deploy Goss test configuration**: Creates a `goss.yaml` file with basic HTTP service checks.
  - **Create Goss systemd service file**: Sets up a systemd service to run Goss in server mode, serving health check results over HTTP.
- **Handlers**:
  - **Reload systemd and restart Goss**: Ensures systemd is aware of the new service file and restarts the Goss service.

### Usage

To use this playbook:

1. Save the playbook to a file (e.g., `setup_goss.yml`).
2. Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook setup_goss.yml
```

Ensure you have Ansible installed and configured to communicate with your target hosts. This playbook will set up Goss to serve a JSON health endpoint on port 8080, which you can adjust as needed by changing the `goss_listen_addr` variable.
