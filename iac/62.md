Creating articles on how to achieve the tasks your product solves can indeed be an effective lead generation strategy, especially for a developer-oriented product. This approach works for several reasons:

### 1. **Showcasing Expertise**
By demonstrating how to solve specific problems, you're effectively showcasing your team's expertise and the thought process behind your product. This establishes credibility and trust with potential customers.

### 2. **SEO Benefits**
Detailed, well-written articles that solve specific problems can rank well in search engines, making it easier for potential customers to find your product when they're searching for solutions to their problems.

### 3. **Providing Value**
Even if developers can follow your guides to solve problems on their own, many may prefer to use a product that saves time and offers additional benefits over a manual implementation. Offering value upfront without asking for anything in return can foster goodwill and lead to conversions down the line.

### 4. **Highlighting Product Advantages**
Through these articles, you can subtly highlight the advantages of your product, such as ease of use, additional features, scalability, or support. This comparison can make the case for why using your product is a better choice than a DIY approach.

### 5. **Community Building**
Engaging content can help build a community around your product. Developers who find your content helpful may share it within their networks, participate in discussions, and provide feedback, further increasing your product's visibility and improving its offerings.

### 6. **Feedback Mechanism**
The feedback and questions you receive on such articles can be invaluable for understanding your users' needs, refining your product, and identifying topics for future articles or product features.

### Considerations
- **Quality Over Quantity:** Ensure that the content is high-quality, genuinely useful, and not just a thinly veiled sales pitch.
- **Target Audience:** Tailor the content to your target audience's skill level and needs. Advanced topics might attract a different audience than beginner-level tutorials.
- **Conversion Strategy:** Have a clear strategy for converting readers into leads. This could include calls to action (CTAs) within the articles, offering downloadable resources in exchange for contact information, or providing trial offers for your product.

### Conclusion
Yes, creating articles that explain how to achieve what your product does can be a good lead generation strategy. It positions your brand as an authority, provides value to potential customers, and can drive organic traffic to your site. However, it's crucial to balance this with direct information about your product's unique value proposition to convert readers into leads effectively.

Yes, the strategy of creating articles to explain how to solve problems that your product addresses aligns closely with the philosophy presented in "They Ask, You Answer" by Marcus Sheridan. This book advocates for a transparent and educational approach to marketing and sales, focusing on being the best teacher in your industry. The core idea is to openly answer the questions and address the concerns your potential customers have, thereby building trust and establishing your company as an authority in your field.

### Key Principles of "They Ask, You Answer" That Relate to This Strategy:

#### 1. **Addressing Customer Questions:**
The book emphasizes answering real questions that customers are asking. By creating content that solves problems or demonstrates how to do something, you're directly responding to your audience's needs and queries.

#### 2. **Educational Content:**
Sheridan suggests that businesses should focus on educating their audience, rather than selling to them in a traditional sense. Articles that guide developers on how to achieve certain tasks fall squarely into this category, providing value and education first.

#### 3. **Building Trust:**
One of the book's premises is that trust is the cornerstone of any successful sales and marketing strategy. By openly sharing knowledge and expertise, even if it means teaching people how to do what your product does, you demonstrate confidence in your product's value and build trust with potential customers.

#### 4. **Differentiation:**
This approach can also differentiate your brand in a crowded market. By being transparent and helpful, you stand out from competitors who might be more guarded with their knowledge.

#### 5. **Content as a Lead Generation Tool:**
"They Ask, You Answer" discusses using content as a way to generate leads. When potential customers find your articles useful, they're more likely to consider your product as a viable solution to their problems, converting content consumers into leads.

### Implementation:
When implementing this strategy, it's crucial to:

- **Be genuinely helpful:** Ensure that your content genuinely aims to help the reader, rather than serving as a veiled advertisement for your product.
- **Cover a broad range of questions:** Address both simple and complex issues that potential customers might have. This broad range ensures that you capture a wide audience.
- **Include calls to action:** While the primary goal is to educate, don't forget to guide readers on what to do next if they're interested in your product.

In summary, creating educational content that answers potential customers' questions and solves their problems is very much in line with the "They Ask, You Answer" approach. It's about prioritizing the needs and questions of your customers and positioning your brand as the go-to source for information and solutions in your industry.

Creating articles on how to do what your product does can be a valuable strategy, but whether it's a good idea and its effectiveness as a lead generator will depend on several factors:

**Pros**

* **Education & Enablement:** Articles demonstrate how to solve problems *using* your product. This educates potential customers, positioning your product as a solution.
* **SEO & Organic Traffic:** Well-written, problem-focused articles can rank organically in search results, bringing interested developers to your content.
* **Building Authority:** Helpful articles establish you as knowledgeable in the domain, building trust that translates to interest in your product.
* **Indirect Lead Generation:**  While not directly selling, these articles nurture potential leads, leading them towards your product when they're ready to implement a solution.

**Cons**

* **Effort vs. Return:**  Creating high-quality articles is time-consuming. Assess if the potential lead generation justifies the investment.
* **Giving Away Too Much:** Strike a balance between providing valuable help and offering so  much that developers can fully build a solution themselves, eliminating the need for your product.
* **Wrong Audience:**  If your target customers are *not* the developers implementing the solutions, these articles might miss the mark.

**Factors for Success**  

* **Product Complexity:** If your product is highly technical or solves complex problems, detailed articles can be a huge draw for your target developer audience.
* **Target Market:** Is your ideal customer the hands-on developer, or do you cater to decision-makers who might then direct developers to use your product?
* **Content Quality:** Superficial articles won't generate leads. The content needs to be genuinely insightful and helpful. 

**It's Not an Either/Or** 

You don't have to choose between offering your product and creating valuable content. A mixed strategy often works best:

* **Free-tier vs. Paid Features:** A free or basic version can attract developers, while the articles help them understand how to upgrade to unlock your product's full potential.
* **Gated Content:** Offer some articles freely for SEO, but create more in-depth guides or whitepapers as lead magnets (requiring an email to access).
* **Customer Success Stories:** Supplement technical articles with success stories highlighting your product's real-world results. This speaks to both developers and decision-makers.

**In conclusion, there's no one-size-fits-all answer.** Carefully evaluate your product, target audience, and resources to determine if technical articles are a strong lead generation strategy for you.

Let me know if you want help with:

* Brainstorming the  kinds of articles that would  resonate with your ideal developer audience. 
* Tips on balancing technical details with a lead generation focus. 

Giving away all the content for free is not an issue, because there are lot of other problems that the first version of the product does not address. Establishing trust by giving first can make them open for  calls via Zoom to find painful problems that can be addressed in the paid tier of the product.

That's a very insightful approach! In that case, giving away content for free can be a powerful strategy, especially considering the context you've provided. Here's why it aligns well with your goals:

* **"Freemium" with a Twist:** You're essentially offering your knowledge and expertise as a valuable 'freemium' offering.  This builds trust and authority with potential customers.
* **Lead Qualification:**  Those who invest time with your content are likely to have genuine problems aligned with your domain. This makes Zoom calls far more productive.
* **Iterative Product Development:** Instead of guessing at paid features, you're directly discovering pain points and needs from qualified leads. It's a fantastic way to ensure your paid product truly delivers value.
* **Long-term Strategy:**  Even developers who initially solve their problems with your free content become warm leads. They're familiar with your expertise and more receptive to your product when their needs expand.  

**Tips for Success:**

* **Focus on High-Value Pain Points:**  Prioritize content that solves real, immediate pain points for developers, even if those solutions are currently absent in your product. This proves your expertise and builds trust fast.
* **Transparency:** Be upfront about the limitations of v1 of your product. This further builds trust and avoids disappointment during Zoom calls.
* **Strong Calls to Action:**  Guide users who find your content helpful towards booking a Zoom call. Make the process easy and compelling.
* **Community Building:** Consider a forum or Slack community around your content.  This fosters engagement and provides a natural space for identifying needs and potential paid features.

**Things to Watch Out For:**

* **Time Investment:**  Content creation takes effort. Ensure you have the resources to produce consistently high-value content.
* **Distraction:**  Don't let content creation take away too much focus from the core product development. Strike a balance.

**Overall, this seems like a smart, customer-centric strategy for your situation!**

**Would you like help with:**

* **Brainstorming article topics that highlight pain points your product will *eventually* address?
* Crafting compelling CTAs within your content to encourage Zoom calls?
 
Time investment for creating the article is part of the product development. Every task that was automated for the developer has been documented as articles with verified code.

Turning product development into content creation is a highly efficient and strategic move. Here's why this approach has even more potential:

**Benefits**

* **Dual-Purpose Work:**  You're not creating additional content workload. Development and  knowledge sharing become a single streamlined process.
* **Authenticity:**  The articles will have the genuineness of being derived directly from your own problem-solving process, making them even more valuable to developers.
* **Developer Empathy:**  Content built this way demonstrates a deep understanding of developer pain points and workflow, which is incredibly attractive to your audience.
* **Product Validation:**  If you're finding solutions worth documenting for others, it inherently validates the value of automating those tasks in your product. 

**Additional Considerations**

* **Organization:**  Develop a system to easily transform your development notes and code into well-structured articles.  This will minimize extra effort later.
* **"Raw" vs. Polished:**  Decide on the balance between quickly publishing 'raw' development notes versus taking extra time to refine them for a wider audience. Each has its merits depending on your goals.
* **Versioning:** As your product evolves, consider how to maintain articles if the underlying code/automations change significantly.

**Maximizing Impact**

* **SEO:** Pay some attention to search engine optimization (keywords, structure) to ensure your content reaches developers searching for similar solutions.
* **Distribution:**  Get these articles out there!  Relevant subreddits, tech forums, and social media can amplify your reach.
* **Feedback Loop:** Encourage comments and questions on articles. This becomes a rich source of further product insights.

**This integrated approach greatly improves the chances of your product resonating with your target audience! It sounds like you're on a fantastic track.**

Yes, in essence, your tactic aligns significantly with the core philosophy of "They Ask, You Answer." Here's why:

**Key Similarities**

* **Customer-Centric:** Both approaches prioritize understanding the questions, problems, and needs of your target audience (developers in your case). 
* **Content as the Answer:** You're proactively creating valuable content that directly addresses the pain points and questions developers already have. 
* **Trust Building:** By offering  helpful solutions, even for free, you establish authority and trust, laying the foundation for future product adoption.

**Where Your Strategy Goes a Step Further**

* **Code-Backed Content:** Your articles derive directly from your product development, carrying the unique authenticity of solved problems and verified code. This adds another layer of value.
* **Development as Marketing:**  You've cleverly combined product development and content creation, making marketing an organic output of your workflow.
* **Iterative Feedback Loop:** Your strategy to use these articles to directly source further product ideas from potential users is a smart and efficient implementation of the "They Ask, You Answer" concept. 

**Nuances**

The book "They Ask, You Answer" places additional emphasis on:

* **SEO:** Highly focused on making sure your content ranks well to match the exact questions people are searching for.
* **Sales Integration:**   Provides a framework to use this content throughout the sales funnel, not just for lead generation.

**Overall, your tactic is an excellent application of the core "They Ask, You Answer" principle.  You can likely incorporate insights from the book to further refine aspects like SEO and the potential sales-enablement side of your content.**

Let me know if you'd like to discuss:

* How to structure your content with search engines in mind (keyword research, etc.)
* Ways to leverage your articles beyond lead generation, during the sales process of your paid product tiers. 

Your tactic shares certain similarities with DigitalOcean's content strategy, but there are also some key differences.

**Similarities to DigitalOcean:**

* **Developer Focus:** Both your approach and DigitalOcean prioritize creating technical content that caters directly to developers' needs and questions.
* **Problem-Solving:**  Content is designed to solve specific problems faced by developers, from basic setup to complex implementations.
* **Trust and Authority:** Both strategies aim to establish DigitalOcean (and you in your case) as a trusted source of knowledge within the developer community.

**Differences:**

* **Breadth of Content:**  DigitalOcean covers a vast range of development topics, not necessarily tied directly to promoting their own products. Your content is, understandably, more niche and linked to the specific problems your product addresses.
* **Product as a Solution vs. Freemium:** DigitalOcean primarily uses content to educate, with their infrastructure products presented as the solution. Your tactic has a touch of 'freemium' where your knowledge is given freely.
* **Scale:**  DigitalOcean has a dedicated content creation team working at a much larger scale than what most businesses could replicate. 

**How Your Approach is Smart:**

* **Niche Focus:**  By hyper-focusing your content on the problems you solve, you'll attract a highly relevant audience of potential customers.
* **Content as Inherent Value:**  Your articles are valuable even if someone never buys your product, which builds stronger trust compared to purely promotional content.

**Overall:** Your tactic draws inspiration form DigitalOcean's success with content but adapts it strategically to a more focused scope and a different business model. 

**Would you like help identifying ways to potentially scale your content creation process similar to DigitalOcean (if this is a long-term goal)?**
