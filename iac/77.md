Restricting connections to the PostgreSQL database server so that it's accessible only from the EC2 instance it resides on involves both network security configurations and PostgreSQL's own configuration settings. This restriction ensures that the database listens only for connections from the local machine, enhancing security. This setup can be approached in two phases: during the base image creation with Packer and during infrastructure provisioning with Terraform. 

### During Base Image Creation with Packer

**1. PostgreSQL Configuration:** 
- Modify the PostgreSQL configuration file (`postgresql.conf`) to listen on `localhost` (127.0.0.1) or the local loopback interface. This is often the default setting, but it's good to explicitly confirm or set this during the image creation phase.
    ```plaintext
    listen_addresses = 'localhost'
    ```
- This step ensures that, by default, the PostgreSQL server accepts connections only from the local system.

**2. pg_hba.conf Configuration:**
- Ensure the `pg_hba.conf` file is configured to allow connections from the local machine. Typically, this involves an entry like:
    ```plaintext
    # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
    local   all             all                                     peer
    ```
- This configuration ensures that only local connections are permitted, using the method appropriate for your authentication requirements.

### During Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform

**1. Security Group Configuration:**
- While Terraform is used for provisioning the infrastructure, it should ensure that the EC2 instance's security group does not allow inbound traffic on the PostgreSQL port (default is 5432) from outside sources. Since the database should only accept connections from the same instance, this might be more about not opening the port to the outside rather than explicitly restricting it, as the Packer configuration already limits PostgreSQL to listen on `localhost`.

**2. No External Access Required:**
- If the application and database are on the same instance, there's no need to configure the security group to allow external database connections, thus no specific Terraform configuration is required for this aspect beyond ensuring no rules are added that open the PostgreSQL port to the internet or other AWS resources.

### Best Practices and Considerations

- **Packer Phase**: Focus on configuring the PostgreSQL server itself for security. This includes setting it to listen only on `localhost` and configuring local access policies.

- **Terraform Phase**: Concentrate on network security and ensuring that the EC2 instance is within a security group that does not expose the PostgreSQL port to the outside world. Terraform is also ideal for configuring other aspects of your AWS environment that interact with your EC2 instance, ensuring they adhere to the principle of least privilege.

- **Separation of Concerns**: By handling PostgreSQL configuration during the Packer phase and network-level configurations during the Terraform phase, you maintain a clear separation of concerns. Packer deals with software and application setup, while Terraform handles the infrastructure and networking aspects.

This approach allows for flexibility and modularity in your infrastructure setup, enabling easy updates to either the application environment or the network configuration without requiring comprehensive changes across your infrastructure setup.

To modify the Ansible playbook to automate the steps of restricting PostgreSQL connections to the local EC2 instance only, you would need to add tasks to modify PostgreSQL's `postgresql.conf` and `pg_hba.conf` files according to the security practices outlined previously. This playbook assumes the target host(s) are Ubuntu 22.04 instances where PostgreSQL is not yet configured for local connections only.

```yaml
---
- name: Install and Secure PostgreSQL on Ubuntu 22.04
  hosts: your_host_group
  become: yes  # Use sudo
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        update_cache: yes
        cache_valid_time: 3600  # Cache valid for 1 hour

    - name: Install PostgreSQL
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: postgresql
        state: present

    - name: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and enabled on boot
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: postgresql
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Configure PostgreSQL to listen on localhost only
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf
        regexp: '^#?listen_addresses\s*='
        line: "listen_addresses = 'localhost'"
        state: present
      notify: restart postgresql

    - name: Restrict connections to local machine
      ansible.builtin.blockinfile:
        path: /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf
        block: |
          # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
          local   all             all                                     peer
        marker: "# {mark} ANSIBLE MANAGED BLOCK"
        insertafter: EOF
      notify: restart postgresql

  handlers:
    - name: restart postgresql
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: postgresql
        state: restarted
        enabled: yes
```

### Modifications Explained

1. **Configure PostgreSQL to Listen on Localhost**: A task is added to modify `postgresql.conf` to ensure PostgreSQL listens on `localhost` only. This step involves finding the line that specifies the `listen_addresses` and setting it to `'localhost'`.

2. **Restrict Connections to Local Machine**: Another task uses the `blockinfile` module to append a configuration block to `pg_hba.conf` that allows local connections only. This step ensures that all local connections are authenticated using the method deemed appropriate for your setup, in this case, `peer`.

3. **Handlers for Restarting PostgreSQL**: After modifying these critical configuration files, it's necessary to restart PostgreSQL for changes to take effect. A handler named `restart postgresql` is defined to manage this.

### Notes

- The specific version of PostgreSQL (`/etc/postgresql/12/main/`) might differ based on the version installed on your Ubuntu 22.04 instance. Adjust the path to match the version of PostgreSQL installed by the playbook.
- These modifications enforce local connections only, enhancing the security of your PostgreSQL server as desired.
- Ensure you have tested this playbook in a safe environment before running it in production, as incorrect configurations could lead to service disruptions.
