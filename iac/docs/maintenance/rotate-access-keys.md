How to assign new access keys to an existing IAM user

To assign new access keys to an existing IAM user, you can follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose "Users".

3. Click on the name of the IAM user you want to assign new access keys to.

4. In the user details page, click on the "Security credentials" tab.

5. Scroll down to the "Access keys" section and click on the "Create access key" button.

6. In the "Create access key" dialog box, you have two options:
   - Click on the "Download .csv file" button to save the access key ID and secret access key to a CSV file on your computer. This is the only time you can save the secret access key, so make sure to store it securely.
   - Click on the "Show" link next to the secret access key to view it, and then copy and paste both the access key ID and secret access key to a secure location.

7. After you have saved the access key information, click on the "Close" button.

The new access key is now active and can be used to make API calls and authenticate with AWS services.

If the IAM user already has two access keys, you will need to delete one of them before you can create a new one. IAM users are limited to a maximum of two access keys at a time.

Update any applications or tools that were using the old access keys with the new ones. Rotating access keys regularly is a good security practice to follow.


To assign new access keys to an existing IAM (Identity and Access Management) user in AWS, you can follow these steps:

1. **Log in to the AWS Management Console**: Open your web browser, go to the AWS Management Console, and log in.

2. **Navigate to the IAM Dashboard**: Find the “Services” menu at the top of the console and search for or click on “IAM” to open the IAM dashboard.

3. **Users Section**: In the IAM dashboard, click on “Users” in the navigation pane on the left side.

4. **Select the User**: Find and click on the username of the IAM user to whom you want to assign new access keys.

5. **Security Credentials Tab**: On the user’s summary page, go to the “Security credentials” tab.

6. **Create Access Key**: Under the “Access keys” section, click on “Create access key”. This will generate a new access key and secret access key.

7. **Download or Copy the Keys**: Make sure to download or copy the new access key ID and secret access key when they are displayed, as you will not be able to see the secret access key again after this step.

8. **Deactivate or Delete Old Keys**: If the user already has existing access keys and you are replacing them, consider deactivating or deleting the old keys to maintain security. You can do this under the same “Access keys” section by clicking on “Make Inactive” or “Delete” for the old keys.

By following these steps, you will successfully assign new access keys to an existing IAM user in AWS.
