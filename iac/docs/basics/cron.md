In AWS, the equivalent of CRON is AWS CloudWatch Events. CloudWatch Events allows you to schedule and trigger automated actions based on a variety of events, including time-based schedules similar to CRON.

With CloudWatch Events, you can create rules that run on a regular schedule or in response to specific events. These rules can trigger various actions, such as invoking AWS Lambda functions, sending messages to Amazon SNS topics, or starting AWS Step Functions state machines.

Here's how you can use CloudWatch Events to achieve CRON-like functionality in AWS:

1. Create a CloudWatch Events Rule:
   - Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudWatch service.
   - Click on "Rules" under the "Events" section in the left sidebar.
   - Click on "Create Rule" to create a new rule.

2. Define the Event Source:
   - In the "Event Source" section, select "Schedule" as the event source.
   - Choose whether you want to use a fixed rate (e.g., every 5 minutes) or a CRON expression to define the schedule.

3. Set the Schedule Expression:
   - If you choose to use a CRON expression, you can specify the schedule using a syntax similar to CRON.
   - The CRON expression in CloudWatch Events follows the format: `cron(minutes hours day-of-month month day-of-week year)`.
   - For example, to run a task every day at 12:00 PM UTC, you would use the expression: `cron(0 12 * * ? *)`.

4. Configure the Target:
   - In the "Targets" section, select the AWS service or resource that you want to trigger when the scheduled event occurs.
   - You can choose from various options, such as invoking a Lambda function, publishing to an SNS topic, or starting an ECS task.
   - Configure the necessary parameters for the selected target, such as the Lambda function name or SNS topic ARN.

5. Specify Additional Settings:
   - You can configure additional settings for the rule, such as assigning a name and description, adding tags, and specifying a role for CloudWatch Events to assume when executing the rule.

6. Create the Rule:
   - Review your settings and click on "Create" to create the CloudWatch Events rule.

Once the rule is created, CloudWatch Events will trigger the specified target based on the defined schedule. You can view the execution history and logs of the triggered actions in the CloudWatch console.

Here's an example CRON expression in CloudWatch Events:

```
cron(0 0 * * ? *)
```

This expression means: run the task every day at midnight (00:00) UTC.

Using CloudWatch Events with CRON expressions provides a flexible and scalable way to schedule and automate tasks in AWS. It allows you to define complex schedules and trigger various actions across different AWS services.

As a beginner DevOps engineer, familiarizing yourself with CloudWatch Events and its scheduling capabilities will help you automate and orchestrate tasks in your AWS environment effectively.
