Here is a series of progressive experiments to familiarize you with Packer, Terraform, and Ansible while constructing your target Rails application infrastructure.  

**Prerequisites:**

* An AWS account with necessary permissions.
* Basic familiarity with command-line tools.
* Ruby, Rails, Puma, and PostgreSQL pre-requisites installed on your local machine.

**Experiment 1: Building the Base Image (Packer)**

1. **Simple Packer Template:** Craft a bare-bones Packer template (JSON or HCL) to build an Amazon Linux 2 AMI. Include provisions to install system updates and essential dependencies like Ruby.
2. **Build the Image:** Run `packer build` to create your first custom AMI. Validate its existence in the AWS EC2 console.

**Experiment 2: Provisioning Basic Infrastructure (Terraform)**

1. **Terraform Configuration:**  Write a Terraform configuration (`.tf` files) to:
   * Reference the AMI created in Experiment 1.
   * Launch an EC2 instance (select an appropriate instance type).
   * Create a security group with port 22 open (for SSH access).
2. **Apply the Plan:**  Use `terraform init` and `terraform apply` to spin up the described infrastructure. Verify you can SSH into the instance.

**Experiment 3: Installing PostgreSQL (Ansible)**

1. **Ansible Inventory:** Create a simple inventory file specifying the public IP address of your EC2 instance.
2. **Ansible Playbook:** Write a basic Ansible playbook (YAML) to:
   * Connect to your EC2 instance.
   * Become root (use privilege escalation).
   * Install PostgreSQL.
   * Start the PostgreSQL service.
3. **Run the Playbook:**  Execute the playbook with `ansible-playbook`. Test you can connect to PostgreSQL from your local machine.

**Experiment 4: Rails Application Setup (Ansible)**

1. **Expand Ansible Playbook:** Augment your playbook to:
   * Install Puma and any additional Rails dependencies.
   * Create a dedicated user for your Rails application.
   * Clone your Rails app repository onto the server under the Rails user.
   * Perform pre-deployment tasks like `bundle install`.

**Experiment 5: Puma Configuration (Ansible)**

1. **Puma Service Setup:** Continue playbook additions to:
   * Configure a Puma service file (systemd).
   * Ensure Puma starts on boot and is accessible for the proper user.

**Experiment 6: Load Balancer and Network (Terraform)**

1. **Update Terraform:** Modify your Terraform files to include:
   * An Application Load Balancer (ALB).
   * Target group directing traffic to your application server.
   * Necessary security group rules for ALB access on port 80/443.
2. **Reapply Terraform:** Use `terraform apply` to update your infrastructure.

**Further Considerations:**

* **Continuous Integration:** Incorporate these into a CI pipeline (GitHub Actions, etc.) for automation.
* **Configuration Management:** As your needs grow, manage system config files consistently across iterations with Ansible, Puppet, or Chef.
* **Monitoring and Logging:** Set up centralized logging and metrics (CloudWatch) to monitor server health and application performance.

**Each experiment progressively enhances your understanding, and your infrastructure starts to mirror your application requirements. Let me know if you want detailed code examples for any phase or want to expand the setup with high availability, database replication, or more!** 

Designing experiments to build prototypes incrementally with Packer, Terraform, and Ansible allows for a structured learning approach. Each step will introduce new concepts and build upon the previous ones, ultimately leading to the provisioning of an EC2 server for a Rails application with Postgres and Puma. Below are the experiments designed to gradually increase in complexity:

### Experiment 1: Hello World with Packer

**Goal:** Learn the basics of Packer by creating a simple image.

1. **Setup Packer**: Install Packer on your local machine.
2. **Create a Packer Template**: Write a basic Packer template that installs an HTTP server on an Ubuntu image.
3. **Build the Image**: Execute Packer to build your image.

### Experiment 2: Introduction to Terraform

**Goal:** Get familiar with Terraform by provisioning a basic AWS EC2 instance.

1. **Setup Terraform**: Install Terraform on your local machine.
2. **Write Terraform Configuration**: Create a Terraform script (`main.tf`) to provision a simple EC2 instance using the default AWS AMI.
3. **Initialize and Apply**: Initialize Terraform and apply your configuration to create the instance.

### Experiment 3: Simple Ansible Playbook

**Goal:** Learn Ansible basics by writing a playbook to configure an existing server.

1. **Setup Ansible**: Install Ansible on your local machine.
2. **Create a Playbook**: Write an Ansible playbook that installs Nginx on an Ubuntu server.
3. **Run the Playbook**: Execute the playbook against an existing server (can be a VM or a cloud instance).

### Experiment 4: Integrating Packer with Ansible

**Goal:** Use Ansible with Packer to provision an image with a configured environment.

1. **Modify Packer Template**: Adjust your Packer template from Experiment 1 to use Ansible as a provisioner to install and configure Nginx.
2. **Build the Image**: Build a new image with Packer using the Ansible provisioner.

### Experiment 5: Terraform with a Custom AMI

**Goal:** Provision an EC2 instance with Terraform using the AMI created in Experiment 4.

1. **Update Terraform Configuration**: Modify your Terraform script to use the AMI ID from Experiment 4 instead of the default AWS AMI.
2. **Provision the EC2 Instance**: Apply the Terraform configuration to provision a new instance with your custom AMI.

### Experiment 6: Ansible for Application Deployment

**Goal:** Use Ansible to deploy a simple Rails application.

1. **Develop a Rails App**: Create a basic Rails application locally or use an existing one.
2. **Create a Playbook**: Write an Ansible playbook to deploy the Rails application, ensuring Ruby, Rails, and Puma are installed and configured.
3. **Run the Playbook**: Execute the playbook against the server provisioned in Experiment 5.

### Experiment 7: Full Stack with Postgres and Puma

**Goal:** Expand the previous experiment to include Postgres and configure Puma as the application server.

1. **Update Ansible Playbook**: Modify your playbook to install Postgres, configure the database, and ensure Puma is set up as the application server for your Rails app.
2. **Deploy**: Run the updated playbook to deploy the full Rails application stack on your server.

### Experiment 8: Scaling with Terraform

**Goal:** Learn to scale your infrastructure with Terraform.

1. **Modify Terraform Configuration**: Adjust your Terraform script to provision multiple EC2 instances or use auto-scaling groups.
2. **Apply Changes**: Use Terraform to apply these changes, scaling your application infrastructure.

### Conclusion

Through these experiments, you'll progressively build knowledge and skills in using Packer, Terraform, and Ansible. Starting with simple tasks and gradually increasing the complexity allows you to understand how these tools can be integrated to automate the deployment and management of a Rails application on AWS EC2 with Postgres as the database and Puma as the application server.
