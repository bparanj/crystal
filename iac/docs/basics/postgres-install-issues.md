The commands you've provided are generally used to add the PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) repository to an Ubuntu system, which allows you to install versions of PostgreSQL that may not be available in the default Ubuntu repositories. These commands should work correctly under most circumstances, but let's break them down to ensure they're properly understood and executed:

### 1. Adding the PGDG Repository

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
```

This command adds the PostgreSQL repository to your system's list of package sources. It uses `$(lsb_release -cs)` to dynamically determine your Ubuntu distribution's codename (e.g., "focal" for Ubuntu 20.04) to ensure the correct repository is added. If this part fails, it could be due to:

- `lsb_release` not being installed. Ensure that the `lsb-release` package is installed (`sudo apt install lsb-release`).
- Permission issues, but using `sudo` should mitigate this.
- Shell interpretation issues when running through `sudo sh -c`. This is less likely but can be troubleshooted by breaking down the command or manually substituting the `$(lsb_release -cs)` part with your distribution's codename.

### 2. Adding the Repository Signing Key

```bash
curl -fsSL https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/postgresql.gpg
```

This command fetches the signing key for the PostgreSQL packages and adds it to your system's list of trusted keys using `gpg --dearmor`. This should work as expected, provided:

- `curl` is installed and can retrieve the key.
- `gpg` is installed (part of the `gnupg` package) and functioning correctly.

If you encounter issues with this command, verify that both `curl` and `gpg` are installed and that you have internet access to fetch the key.

### Common Issues

If you're following these steps and still can't install `postgresql-16`, consider:

- **Running `sudo apt update`** after adding the repository and before trying to install PostgreSQL. This step is crucial as it updates your package lists with the newly added repository.
- **Verifying PostgreSQL Version Availability**: As of my last training data, PostgreSQL 16 might not be released yet, or if it was recently released, it may not yet be available in the PGDG repository for all distributions. Check the [PostgreSQL Linux downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/) for the latest instructions and available versions.
- **Distribution Codename Mismatch**: If your distribution's codename isn't correctly identified by `lsb_release -cs`, manually replace `$(lsb_release -cs)` with your actual codename in the repository line.

If you've run `sudo apt update` and continue to receive errors about being unable to locate the `postgresql-16` package, double-check the PGDG repository's availability for your specific Ubuntu version and the availability of the PostgreSQL version you're attempting to install.

The error message `E: Unable to locate package postgresql-16` suggests that the PostgreSQL version 16 packages are not available in the default repositories for your version of Ubuntu or Debian. This is common with newer software versions that haven't been included in the official repositories yet or if the repository list isn't updated to include sources that offer those versions.

### To Install PostgreSQL 16 on Ubuntu/Debian:

1. **Add the PostgreSQL APT Repository**:
   PostgreSQL provides its own APT repositories for all supported versions of PostgreSQL for Debian and Ubuntu. You need to add this repository to get access to newer versions.

2. **Import the Repository Signing Key**:
   You must import the GPG key for the PostgreSQL packages. As of my last update, you can do this with the following command:

   ```bash
   wget -qO - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/postgresql.asc
   ```

3. **Add the PostgreSQL Repository**:
   Add the PostgreSQL repository to your system's software source list. Replace `$(lsb_release -cs)` with your Ubuntu distribution's codename if necessary (e.g., `focal`, `bionic`, etc.). Since you're looking for PostgreSQL 16, you'll want to ensure you're using a distribution version that the PostgreSQL project supports for version 16.

   ```bash
   echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
   ```

4. **Update Package Lists**:
   After adding the repository, update your package list to include the newly added repository.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

5. **Install PostgreSQL 16**:
   Now that your package lists are updated to include the PostgreSQL repository, attempt to install PostgreSQL 16 again.

   ```bash
   sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install postgresql-16 postgresql-contrib-16 -y
   ```

### Note:
- If you still encounter issues with finding the package, double-check the repository addition steps and ensure your system's distribution codename is correctly identified by `$(lsb_release -cs)`.
- PostgreSQL versions and their availability may vary, and newer versions might be released after my last update. Always refer to the [official PostgreSQL download instructions](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/) for the most current information.
- This process adds a third-party repository managed by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group to your system. It's a common and recommended practice for installing PostgreSQL, but always ensure you trust third-party repositories before adding them to your system.
