Yes, the word "egress" also has its origins in Latin. It comes from the Latin word "egressus," which means "going out" or "departure."

Similar to "ingress," the word "egress" is used in various contexts beyond networking and security. In architecture, it refers to the act of leaving a building or a space, often in the context of emergency exits or evacuation routes.

In networking and security, including in AWS, "egress" specifically refers to the outbound traffic or the traffic that leaves a resource or a network. It is used to describe the flow of data or packets originating from within a resource or network and going outside of it.

Both "ingress" and "egress" have maintained their Latin roots and are used in English as nouns to describe the act of entering (ingress) and leaving (egress), as well as adjectives to describe things related to entering (ingress rules) or leaving (egress traffic).

These terms have been adopted in the field of networking and security to clearly differentiate between inbound and outbound traffic, making it easier to discuss, configure, and manage network traffic flows.
