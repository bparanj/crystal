In the context of AWS, "ingress" refers to the inbound traffic or incoming network traffic to a resource, such as an EC2 instance, load balancer, or security group. It represents the traffic that originates from outside the resource and is allowed to enter and reach the resource.

The term "ingress" is used in contrast to "egress," which refers to the outbound traffic or outgoing network traffic from a resource.

The naming of "ingress" and "egress" comes from the general terminology used in networking and security:

1. Ingress: The word "ingress" means "the act of entering or going in." In networking, it signifies the traffic that enters or comes into a resource or network. It is used to describe the inbound traffic flow.

2. Egress: The word "egress" means "the act of going out or leaving." In networking, it signifies the traffic that leaves or goes out of a resource or network. It is used to describe the outbound traffic flow.

These terms are commonly used in various contexts related to networking, security, and cloud services, including AWS.

In AWS, you can control and manage ingress traffic using security groups, network ACLs, and other security mechanisms. For example, when configuring a security group for an EC2 instance, you define ingress rules to specify which traffic is allowed to reach the instance based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. Similarly, when configuring a load balancer, you define ingress rules to determine which traffic is allowed to reach the load balancer and be forwarded to the registered targets.

Understanding and properly configuring ingress rules is crucial for securing your resources and controlling access to them in AWS.

You're correct. "Ingress" is not a short form or abbreviation of another word. It is a standalone term that has its own meaning in the context of networking and security.

The word "ingress" comes from the Latin word "ingressus," which means "entering." It is used in various contexts beyond networking, such as in architecture, where it refers to the act of entering a building or a space.

In the specific context of AWS and networking, "ingress" is used as a noun to refer to the inbound traffic itself, and it can also be used as an adjective, such as "ingress rules," to describe the rules that govern the inbound traffic.

So, to reiterate, "ingress" is a complete word on its own and not a shortened version of another term.

An ingress rule in AWS defines the inbound traffic that is allowed to reach a resource, such as an EC2 instance or a security group. It specifies the source (IP address or security group), protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.), and port range for incoming traffic that should be permitted.

You need an ingress rule when you want to:

1. Allow inbound traffic to your resources (e.g., EC2 instances) from specific sources.
2. Control access to your resources by specifying the allowed protocols and ports.
3. Enable communication between resources within a VPC or from external networks.

Ingress rules are typically used to:
- Permit incoming SSH or RDP access for remote management.
- Allow web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) to reach your application servers.
- Enable communication between different components of your application architecture.

Without ingress rules, no inbound traffic can reach your resources by default, ensuring a secure configuration. You add ingress rules to selectively allow the necessary inbound access while keeping unwanted traffic restricted.
