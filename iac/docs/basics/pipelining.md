```ansible.cfg
[ssh_connection]
pipelining = True
```

In an Ansible configuration file (ansible.cfg), the `pipelining` option under the `[ssh_connection]` section determines whether Ansible should use SSH pipelining when executing tasks on remote hosts.

When `pipelining` is set to `True`, Ansible enables SSH pipelining for connections to the managed nodes. SSH pipelining is an optimization technique that can significantly improve the performance of Ansible playbook execution.

Here's how SSH pipelining works:

1. Instead of establishing a new SSH connection for each task or module execution, Ansible creates a persistent SSH connection to the remote host.
2. Ansible sends multiple commands or tasks through the same SSH connection, reducing the overhead of creating new connections for each task.
3. The remote host executes the commands or tasks in the order they were received, without waiting for a response before proceeding to the next command.
4. The output of each command or task is sent back to Ansible through the same SSH connection.

By enabling SSH pipelining, Ansible can reduce the number of SSH connections required and minimize the time spent waiting for new connections to be established. This can lead to faster playbook execution, especially when dealing with a large number of tasks or managed nodes.

However, there are a few considerations when enabling SSH pipelining:

1. The remote hosts must have the necessary SSH configuration to support pipelining. This typically requires the `RequireRTT` setting to be disabled in the SSH server configuration.
2. Some tasks or modules may not be compatible with SSH pipelining, particularly those that require interactive input or rely on certain terminal settings.
3. If a task fails during the pipelined execution, Ansible may not receive the failure status immediately, as the output is buffered. This can lead to subsequent tasks being executed even if a previous task failed.

Despite these considerations, enabling SSH pipelining can provide significant performance benefits in most Ansible deployments.

It's important to note that the `pipelining` option is set to `False` by default in Ansible. If you want to enable SSH pipelining, you need to explicitly set `pipelining = True` in your ansible.cfg file or use the `--ssh-pipelining` command-line flag when running Ansible commands.

To check if the `RequireRTT` setting is disabled in the SSH server configuration, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the SSH server configuration file:
   - On most Linux distributions, the SSH server configuration file is located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
   - Use a text editor with root privileges to open the file. For example, you can use the following command:
     ```
     sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```

2. Look for the `RequireRTT` setting:
   - Search for the line that starts with `RequireRTT` in the configuration file.
   - If the line exists and is uncommented (i.e., not preceded by a `#` symbol), check its value.
   - If the line is commented out or doesn't exist, it means the setting is not explicitly configured, and the default value is used.

3. Check the value of `RequireRTT`:
   - If the line exists and is uncommented, the value should be either `yes` or `no`.
   - If the value is set to `no`, it means `RequireRTT` is disabled, and SSH pipelining should work without issues.
   - If the value is set to `yes`, it means `RequireRTT` is enabled, and SSH pipelining may not work correctly.

4. Save and close the configuration file:
   - If you made any changes to the configuration file, save the changes and exit the text editor.

5. Restart the SSH service (if necessary):
   - If you modified the SSH server configuration file, you need to restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect.
   - Run the following command to restart the SSH service:
     ```
     sudo systemctl restart ssh
     ```

   Note: The exact command to restart the SSH service may vary depending on your Linux distribution and init system.

By following these steps, you can check the value of the `RequireRTT` setting in the SSH server configuration and ensure that it is disabled (`no`) to support SSH pipelining.

If the `RequireRTT` setting is not explicitly configured or is already set to `no`, you don't need to make any changes to the SSH server configuration for SSH pipelining to work with Ansible.

Modifying the SSH server configuration file can have security implications, so be cautious when making changes and ensure that you understand the impact of each setting before modifying it.
