Here are the steps to use Multipass by Ubuntu on a Mac:

1. Install Multipass:
   - Download the Multipass installer for macOS from the official website: https://multipass.run
   - Open the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the installation wizard to install Multipass.

2. Open Terminal:
   - Launch the Terminal application on your Mac.

3. Create a new instance:
   ```
   multipass launch --name my-instance
   ```
   This command creates a new instance named "my-instance" with the default Ubuntu image.

4. List instances:
   ```
   multipass list
   ```
   This command displays a list of all running instances.

5. Shell into an instance:
   ```
   multipass shell my-instance
   ```
   This command opens a shell session inside the specified instance.

6. Run commands inside the instance:
   - Once you're inside the instance's shell, you can run any Linux command or install packages using `apt`.
   - For example, to update the package list and install a package:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install package-name
     ```

7. Stop an instance:
   ```
   multipass stop my-instance
   ```
   This command stops the specified instance.

8. Start an instance:
   ```
   multipass start my-instance
   ```
   This command starts a previously stopped instance.

9. Delete an instance:
   ```
   multipass delete my-instance
   ```
   This command deletes the specified instance.

10. Cleanup and remove all instances:
    ```
    multipass cleanup
    multipass purge
    ```
    The `cleanup` command removes all stopped instances, while `purge` removes all instances and releases the associated resources.

These are the basic steps to get started with Multipass on a Mac. You can refer to the official Multipass documentation (https://multipass.run/docs) for more advanced usage and commands.

To use Ubuntu 22.04 with Multipass, you can specify the desired image when launching a new instance. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.

2. Launch a new instance with Ubuntu 22.04:
   ```
   multipass launch --name my-instance jammy
   ```
   The `--name` flag allows you to specify a name for your instance (replace "my-instance" with your desired name).
   The `jammy` keyword tells Multipass to use the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) image.

   Alternatively, you can use the full image name:
   ```
   multipass launch --name my-instance ubuntu:22.04
   ```

3. Wait for the instance to be created and provisioned. Multipass will download the Ubuntu 22.04 image if it's not already available locally.

4. Once the instance is ready, you can shell into it:
   ```
   multipass shell my-instance
   ```
   This command opens a shell session inside the Ubuntu 22.04 instance.

5. You can now run commands, install packages, and use the instance as a regular Ubuntu 22.04 environment.

6. To exit the shell session and return to your Mac's terminal, type `exit` or press `Ctrl+D`.

You can manage the instance using the standard Multipass commands, such as `multipass list`, `multipass stop`, `multipass start`, and `multipass delete`.

Note that the first time you create an instance with Ubuntu 22.04, Multipass will download the image, which may take some time depending on your internet connection speed. Subsequent instances using the same image will be faster to create since the image is already available locally.

Multipass and Lima are both tools for running virtual machines on macOS, but they have some differences and similarities. Here's a comparison:

Differences:
1. Hypervisor:
   - Multipass: Multipass uses HyperKit, which is a lightweight macOS hypervisor built on top of Hypervisor.framework.
   - Lima: Lima uses QEMU, a generic machine emulator and virtualizer.

2. Image Support:
   - Multipass: Multipass primarily focuses on running Ubuntu instances, although it supports other Linux distributions as well.
   - Lima: Lima supports a wider range of operating system images, including Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux, and more.

3. Command-line Interface:
   - Multipass: Multipass provides a user-friendly command-line interface with simple commands for managing instances.
   - Lima: Lima uses a YAML configuration file to define and manage virtual machines, and it integrates with the `limactl` command-line tool.

4. Integration:
   - Multipass: Multipass integrates with the host system's DNS and networking, making it easier to access services running inside the instances.
   - Lima: Lima focuses on providing a isolated environment and requires manual configuration for network access to the host system.

Similarities:
1. Purpose:
   - Both Multipass and Lima are used for running virtual machines on macOS, providing a way to use Linux environments locally.

2. Lightweight:
   - Both tools aim to be lightweight and have minimal overhead compared to traditional virtual machine solutions.

3. Command-line Driven:
   - Multipass and Lima are primarily controlled through the command-line interface, allowing users to create, manage, and interact with virtual machines.

4. File Sharing:
   - Both tools support sharing files and directories between the host system and the virtual machines.

5. Snapshots:
   - Multipass and Lima support creating snapshots of virtual machines, allowing users to save the state of an instance and revert back to it later.

Overall, Multipass focuses on simplicity and ease of use, particularly for running Ubuntu instances, while Lima offers more flexibility and supports a wider range of operating systems. The choice between the two depends on your specific needs, preferred workflow, and the level of customization you require.
