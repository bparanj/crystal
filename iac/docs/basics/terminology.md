## Terminology

### Heuristic

The term for a rule that helps you to choose between potential solutions is a "Heuristic." 

Heuristics are strategies or approaches that guide problem-solving, decision-making, or discovery. They simplify the processes of finding solutions through practical methods not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect but sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or approximation. In various contexts, including design, engineering, and everyday decision-making, heuristics serve as valuable tools for navigating complex or uncertain situations by providing a framework for making choices without exhaustive analysis.

### Approach

The term for a way of implementing something that is not necessarily the only or the best way for a particular situation is an "Approach."

### Stack

The term for a collection of infrastructure resources that are defined and changed together is "Infrastructure as Code" (IaC). However, when specifically referring to a collection of resources treated as a single unit, the term "Stack" is often used within the context of IaC. A "stack" can be understood as a group of infrastructure components—such as networks, servers, and services—that are managed together as a unit, based on templates or definitions provided in code form. This approach allows for the entire infrastructure setup to be versioned, replicated, and managed with the same control and efficiency as application code.
