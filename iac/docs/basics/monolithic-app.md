Deploying an MVC (Model-View-Controller) monolithic application on a single EC2 instance can be seen as a form of a single-tier architecture, but it's important to distinguish between the concepts of "tier" and "layer" in software architecture, as they often get conflated.

### Layers vs. Tiers

- **Layer**: Refers to the logical separation of responsibilities within an application. For instance, an MVC application inherently has three layers:
  - **Model**: The data layer, responsible for managing the data, logic, and rules of the application.
  - **View**: The presentation layer, responsible for displaying the data to the user.
  - **Controller**: The application logic layer, responsible for receiving inputs from the user and deciding what to do with them.
- **Tier**: Refers to the physical distribution of those layers across separate servers or platforms. In tiered architectures, you might have:
  - **Single-Tier**: All components of the application run on a single machine or instance.
  - **Two-Tier**: Often involves a client application communicating with a server, for example, a web server and a database server.
  - **Three-Tier**: Typically adds a middle layer, such as an application server, between the client and database to process logic, translations, and database queries.

### Single-Tier Application

In the context of deploying a monolithic MVC application on a single EC2 instance:
- **Single-Tier Architecture**: Yes, if your entire application (view, controller, and model components) and potentially your database (if it's not connecting to an external database service) are running within the same EC2 instance, it's considered a single-tier architecture. This is because there's no physical distribution of components across separate machines or services.
- **Three-Layer Application**: Despite being deployed as a single-tier architecture, the application still maintains a three-layer structure internally, following the MVC pattern.

### Considerations

- **Simplicity vs. Scalability**: Single-tier deployments are simple to set up and manage but can have limitations in scalability and fault tolerance. As your application grows, you might consider breaking it down into multiple tiers for better scalability, maintainability, and resilience.
- **Resource Contention**: Running everything on a single instance can lead to resource contention, where the application's UI, logic, and data storage compete for the same system resources.
- **Security and Maintenance**: Single-tier applications can also present challenges in terms of security patching and updates, as any change affects the entire system.

### Conclusion

While a monolithic MVC app deployed on a single EC2 instance operates as a single-tier application, it's essential to remember that it still comprises multiple layers architecturally. The choice of a single-tier deployment should be balanced against the application's specific needs for scalability, maintenance, and operational complexity.
