Yes, creating a public subnet for Caddy and a private subnet for PostgreSQL, Redis, and the Rack app is a good architectural design for improved security. This setup follows the best practice of separating the publicly accessible components from the internal components that should not be directly exposed to the internet.

Here's how you can set up the subnets:

1. Public Subnet for Caddy:
   - Create a public subnet in your VPC.
   - Configure the subnet to automatically assign public IP addresses to EC2 instances launched within it.
   - Place your Caddy EC2 instance in this public subnet.
   - Configure the security group for the Caddy instance to allow inbound HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic from the desired sources.

2. Private Subnet for PostgreSQL, Redis, and Rack App:
   - Create a private subnet in your VPC.
   - Place your EC2 instance hosting PostgreSQL, Redis, and the Rack app in this private subnet.
   - Configure the security group for this instance to allow inbound traffic only from the Caddy instance on the necessary ports (e.g., PostgreSQL: 5432, Redis: 6379, Rack app: specific port).
   - Ensure that the private subnet does not have a direct route to the internet gateway.

3. Communication between Subnets:
   - Configure the security group rules to allow communication between the Caddy instance in the public subnet and the instance hosting PostgreSQL, Redis, and the Rack app in the private subnet.
   - The Caddy instance should be able to initiate connections to the private instance on the required ports.

4. Internet Access for Private Subnet:
   - If the instance in the private subnet requires internet access for updates, package installations, or other purposes, you can set up a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance in the public subnet.
   - The NAT Gateway/Instance will allow outbound internet access for instances in the private subnet while preventing direct inbound access from the internet.

By placing Caddy in a public subnet and PostgreSQL, Redis, and the Rack app in a private subnet, you create a secure architecture where only the necessary components (Caddy) are exposed to the internet. The internal components (PostgreSQL, Redis, Rack app) are not directly accessible from the internet, reducing the attack surface and enhancing security.

Caddy acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding incoming requests to the Rack app in the private subnet, while the Rack app can securely communicate with PostgreSQL and Redis within the same private subnet.

Remember to configure the appropriate security group rules and NACLs to further control the traffic flow between the subnets and to the internet.

This architecture provides a balance between accessibility and security, allowing you to expose only the necessary components to the internet while keeping the sensitive components protected in a private subnet.
