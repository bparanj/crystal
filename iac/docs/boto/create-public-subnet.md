To create a public subnet named "RailsPublicSubnet" in the previously created "RailsVPC" using boto3, you need to specify the VPC ID, CIDR block, and the setting to automatically assign public IP addresses to instances launched in this subnet. This mirrors the Terraform configuration you provided but translated into Python code for use with boto3. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
import boto3

# Assuming you already have the VPC ID from the previous operation
# vpc_id = 'your-vpc-id-here'

# For demonstration, let's fetch the VPC ID by its name (e.g., "rails-vpc")
ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
vpcs = list(ec2.vpcs.filter(Filters=[{'Name': 'tag:Name', 'Value': 'rails-vpc'}]))

if not vpcs:
    print("No VPC found with the name 'rails-vpc'. Please check the VPC name and try again.")
else:
    vpc_id = vpcs[0].id
    print(f"Using VPC ID: {vpc_id}")

    # Create an EC2 client
    ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

    # Create a public subnet within the RailsVPC
    response = ec2_client.create_subnet(
        VpcId=vpc_id,
        CidrBlock='10.0.10.0/24',  # Your desired CIDR block for the subnet
        AvailabilityZone='us-west-2a',  # Specify the appropriate Availability Zone
        TagSpecifications=[
            {
                'ResourceType': 'subnet',
                'Tags': [
                    {
                        'Key': 'Name',
                        'Value': 'rails-public-subnet'
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    )

    # Extract Subnet ID from response
    subnet_id = response['Subnet']['SubnetId']

    # Enable auto-assign public IP for this subnet
    ec2_client.modify_subnet_attribute(
        SubnetId=subnet_id,
        MapPublicIpOnLaunch={
            'Value': True
        }
    )

    print(f"Created public subnet ID: {subnet_id}")
```

### Key Steps:

1. **Fetch the VPC ID**: This code snippet includes an example of how to fetch the VPC ID by the VPC name ('rails-vpc'). This assumes that you have already created a VPC named "rails-vpc" and that it's uniquely named within your AWS account.
   
2. **Create the Subnet**: We then create a subnet with the specified CIDR block within the VPC. The `AvailabilityZone` is specified to ensure the subnet is created in the desired location.

3. **Enable Auto-Assign Public IP**: After creating the subnet, we modify its attribute to enable automatic assignment of public IP addresses to instances launched within this subnet, mirroring the `map_public_ip_on_launch = true` setting in Terraform.

Replace the placeholder values (like `your-vpc-id-here` and the CIDR block if different from your plan) with actual values relevant to your AWS setup. This script will create a public subnet within your specified VPC and configure it to assign public IP addresses to instances upon launch, akin to your Terraform resource definition for "RailsPublicSubnet".
