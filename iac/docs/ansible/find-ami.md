To find the AMI identifier for the latest version of 64-bit Ubuntu 22.04 using the `amazon.aws.ec2_ami_info` module in an Ansible playbook, you would structure your playbook like this:

```yaml
---
- name: Find Ubuntu 22.04 AMI ID
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Get AMI for Ubuntu 22.04
      amazon.aws.ec2_ami_info:
        filters:
          name: "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"
          architecture: "x86_64"
          root-device-type: "ebs"
          virtualization-type: "hvm"
          state: "available"
        owners: "099720109477" # Canonical's AWS account ID
        sort: "creation_date"
        sort_order: "descending"
        sort_end: 1
      register: ami_info

    - name: Print the latest Ubuntu 22.04 AMI ID
      debug:
        msg: "The latest Ubuntu 22.04 AMI ID is {{ ami_info.images[0].image_id }}"
```

### Key Points:

- **Filters**: This section is crucial for narrowing down the search to Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) images. The `name` filter is used to match the naming convention of Ubuntu 22.04 AMIs provided by Canonical.
- **Owners**: The `owners` parameter is set to Canonical's AWS account ID (`099720109477`) to ensure you're retrieving official Ubuntu images.
- **Sorting**: The `sort`, `sort_order`, and `sort_end` parameters are used to ensure that you get the most recent AMI based on its creation date.
- **`register`: ami_info**: The found AMI information is stored in the `ami_info` variable.
- **Print AMI ID**: The last task uses the `debug` module to print the AMI ID of the latest Ubuntu 22.04 image.

You must have the `amazon.aws` collection installed (`ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws`) and AWS access credentials configured for Ansible. This playbook will return the AMI ID of the latest Ubuntu 22.04 LTS version available in your default AWS region. If you're targeting a specific region, make sure to set it in your AWS CLI configuration or include a `region` parameter in the task.
