Your steps outline a process for creating and using a PEM file in AWS, configuring an EC2 instance with Ansible, creating a custom AMI, and then making it public. Here's a review with enhancements for clarity and completeness:

1. **Create PEM File on Local Machine**: Correct. Generate an SSH key pair (PEM file) for secure access to your EC2 instances.

2. **Upload PEM File to AWS Account**: Correct. Import the PEM file to AWS as an EC2 key pair to use it for EC2 instances.

3. **Use PEM File in Ansible Playbooks**: Correct. Reference the uploaded key pair by name in your Ansible playbooks to launch EC2 instances.

4. **Configure EC2 Instance Using Ansible**: Slightly adjust this step to explicitly state the use of Ansible for configuring the instance according to your requirements before creating the AMI. This includes any software installation, configuration, and setup tasks.

5. **Create Custom AMI Using That PEM File**: The PEM file itself is not used in the AMI creation process. The step should focus on preparing the instance (e.g., cleanup and removing unnecessary files) before creating the AMI.

6. **Remove PEM File from the EC2 Instance**: Correct. It's crucial to remove sensitive files, including the PEM file if it was transferred to the instance, and any other sensitive information before creating the AMI.

7. **Create Custom AMI**: After cleaning up the instance, create the AMI from the EC2 console or using the AWS CLI. This step formalizes the creation of your custom AMI.

8. **Publish Customized AMI to Public**: Correct. Modify the AMI permissions to make it available to the public or specific AWS accounts. Ensure that no sensitive data is exposed in the AMI.

### Additional Steps and Considerations:

- **Testing the Custom AMI**: Before making the AMI public, launch a new instance using the custom AMI to verify that everything works as expected and no sensitive information is included.

- **Documentation**: Prepare documentation for your AMI users, detailing how to launch and configure instances using your AMI, expected behavior, and any necessary configuration after launch.

- **Security Best Practices**: Ensure you follow AWS security best practices for AMIs. This includes checking for security vulnerabilities, using secure configurations, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and guidelines.

## One Box

I have only one EC2 instance that runs Puma, Postgresql and Caddy. Is the steps for configuring a VPC correct:

1. Create a VPC
2. Add a subnet
3. Assign IP addresses to VPC and subnet
4. Use route tables to define network traffic for subnet
5. Use Internet Gateway to connect VPC to the Internet

Your steps are fundamentally correct, but ensuring clarity around the configuration and cleanup steps will help avoid misunderstandings and potential security issues.

Your steps for configuring a VPC for hosting services like Puma, PostgreSQL, and Caddy on a single EC2 instance are generally correct. However, to ensure full connectivity and security, consider these additions:

6. **Security Groups**: Define security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to your EC2 instance.

7. **NAT Gateway (optional)**: If your EC2 instance needs to initiate outbound internet connections while keeping inbound traffic private, use a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance in addition to the Internet Gateway.

Everything else in your list is essential for setting up a VPC.
