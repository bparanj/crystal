## CIDR

The purpose of CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is to enable more flexible allocation of IP addresses than the older class-based system, optimizing the use of available IP address space and facilitating route aggregation to reduce the size of routing tables.

No, CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is not specific to AWS; it is a standard method for allocating IP addresses and routing IP packets. It is used universally in networking.

## Routing Table

Yes, routing tables are required in AWS to control the routing of traffic between subnets, the internet, and other networks within a VPC.

The purpose of a routing table is to define rules (routes) that determine where network traffic is directed based on the destination IP address. It guides the forwarding of packets from one network to another.

## Broadcast Traffic

Limiting broadcast traffic reduces network congestion and improves overall network performance by preventing unnecessary data from being sent to all devices on a network.

## Configuring Network

Deciding whether a resource should be public-facing or internal and what CIDR address to assign involves several considerations:

### Public vs. Internal Resource:
1. **Accessibility Needs**: If the resource needs to be accessible from the internet (e.g., a web server), it should be public-facing. If it only needs to communicate within the network (e.g., a database), it should be internal.
2. **Security Considerations**: Public-facing resources are more exposed to security threats. If a resource handles sensitive data or critical operations, consider keeping it internal unless necessary.
3. **Performance and Cost**: Public-facing resources might require more robust security measures and potentially higher performance due to external traffic, which could influence cost.

### CIDR Address Assignment:
1. **Network Size and Scalability**: Choose a CIDR block that accommodates the current size of the network and allows for future growth. A larger CIDR block provides more IP addresses.
2. **Subnetting Strategy**: Your CIDR allocation should align with your subnetting strategy, considering how you plan to divide the network into subnets for different uses or availability zones.
3. **Addressing Scheme Consistency**: Maintain a logical and consistent addressing scheme that simplifies management, reduces configuration errors, and aids in troubleshooting.
4. **Compatibility and Integration**: Ensure the CIDR blocks do not overlap with other networks you need to connect with, such as on-premises networks or other VPCs, to avoid routing conflicts.

### Key Takeaways:
- Decide on public-facing or internal status based on accessibility needs, security considerations, and performance/cost implications.
- Assign CIDR addresses based on network size and scalability needs, your subnetting strategy, the importance of a consistent addressing scheme, and the need for compatibility with other networks.
