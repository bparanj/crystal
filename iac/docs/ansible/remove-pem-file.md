Once you have created the AMI, you can remove the PEM file association by performing the following steps in your Ansible playbook:

```yaml
---
# ... (previous tasks to create PEM file, EC2 instance, and customize the image) ...

# Create AMI from the customized EC2 instance
- name: Create AMI
  amazon.aws.ec2_ami:
    instance_id: "{{ ec2_instance.instance_id }}"
    name: "CustomBaseAMI-{{ timestamp }}"
    wait: yes
    tags:
      Name: "CustomBaseAMI"
      Description: "Custom base AMI without PEM file association"
  register: ami_info

# Remove the PEM file association from the EC2 instance
- name: Remove PEM file association
  amazon.aws.ec2_instance:
    instance_ids: "{{ ec2_instance.instance_id }}"
    key_name: ""
    state: present

# Terminate the EC2 instance
- name: Terminate EC2 instance
  amazon.aws.ec2_instance:
    instance_ids: "{{ ec2_instance.instance_id }}"
    state: absent

# ... (additional tasks for further customization or cleanup) ...
```

Here's what the playbook does:

1. After customizing the EC2 instance, create an AMI from the instance using the `amazon.aws.ec2_ami` module. Specify the `instance_id` of the customized instance and provide a name for the AMI. The `register` keyword stores the AMI information in the `ami_info` variable.

2. Remove the PEM file association from the EC2 instance using the `amazon.aws.ec2_instance` module. Set the `key_name` parameter to an empty string (`""`) to disassociate the PEM file from the instance. This step ensures that the AMI created from this instance will not have the PEM file associated with it.

3. Terminate the EC2 instance using the `amazon.aws.ec2_instance` module with the `state` parameter set to `absent`. This step is optional but recommended to clean up the instance after creating the AMI.

4. You can perform any additional tasks for further customization or cleanup as needed.

By removing the PEM file association from the EC2 instance before creating the AMI, you ensure that the resulting AMI does not have the PEM file associated with it. This allows you to use the AMI as a base image for creating customer-specific images without the PEM file.

Remember to adjust the playbook according to your specific requirements and replace the placeholders (`{{ ec2_instance.instance_id }}`, `{{ timestamp }}`) with the appropriate values.

Also, make sure you have the necessary permissions and AWS credentials configured for Ansible to interact with your AWS account and perform the required actions.
