Create a Terraform template to assign static IP for a EC2 image created by Packer

To achieve this task, you need to follow a two-step process: first, create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) using Packer with your desired configuration, and second, use Terraform to deploy an EC2 instance using that AMI and assign it a static IP address, also known as an Elastic IP (EIP) in AWS terminology.

### Step 1: Create a Packer Template in HCL

Create a Packer template named `packer.pkr.hcl` for building your AMI. Here's a basic example using HCL:

```hcl
variable "aws_access_key" {
  type    = string
  default = "your-access-key"
}

variable "aws_secret_key" {
  type    = string
  default = "your-secret-key"
}

locals { timestamp = regex_replace(timestamp(), "[- TZ:]", "") }

source "amazon-ebs" "example" {
  access_key    = var.aws_access_key
  secret_key    = var.aws_secret_key
  region        = "us-east-1"
  source_ami_filter {
    filters = {
      virtualization-type = "hvm"
      name                = "amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-ebs"
      root-device-type    = "ebs"
    }
    owners      = ["137112412989"]
    most_recent = true
  }
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ssh_username  = "ec2-user"
  ami_name      = "packer-example-${local.timestamp}"
}

build {
  sources = [
    "source.amazon-ebs.example"
  ]
}
```

This Packer template defines a source configuration for an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, using Amazon Linux 2 as the base. It specifies the AWS credentials, region, and instance type, among other parameters. Note that you should replace `"your-access-key"` and `"your-secret-key"` with your actual AWS credentials or, preferably, use environment variables to avoid hardcoding sensitive information.

### Step 2: Use Terraform to Deploy an EC2 Instance and Assign a Static IP

Now, let's move on to deploying an EC2 instance with Terraform and assigning it a static IP address. The `main.tf` Terraform configuration remains the same as previously described:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_eip" "example" {
  vpc = true
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-123456" # Replace this with your actual AMI ID from Packer
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
  }
}

resource "aws_eip_association" "example" {
  instance_id   = aws_instance.example.id
  allocation_id = aws_eip.example.id
}
```

After creating your AMI with Packer, replace `"ami-123456"` with the actual AMI ID you receive. This Terraform configuration will create an EC2 instance from your custom AMI and associate an Elastic IP with it.

### Key Takeaways

- Using HCL for both Packer and Terraform configurations provides a consistent and readable way to define infrastructure as code.
- Packer's HCL format allows for more structured and modular template definitions.
- By separating the creation of the AMI and the deployment of infrastructure into two steps, you maintain flexibility and reusability in your infrastructure management.
- Always ensure your AWS credentials are managed securely, using environment variables or IAM roles where possible.

Here's a Terraform HCL template that demonstrates how to assign a static IP address to an EC2 instance, along with explanations.  **Importantly, this assumes you have some pre-existing infrastructure setup by Packer.**

**Prerequisites**

* **Packer-created AMI:** You need an AMI produced by your Packer HCL template. This AMI will become the base image for your EC2 instance.
* **Existing VPC and Subnet:** Terraform needs a VPC and subnet within which to launch the EC2 instance.

**Terraform HCL Template**

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "your-aws-region" # Replace with your actual region
}

# Data sources to fetch existing resources
data "aws_ami" "example_ami" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["self"]  # Assumes Packer AMI is owned by your account
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ami-name-from-packer*"] 
  }
}

data "aws_vpc" "main" {
  default = true # Assuming you have a default VPC
}

data "aws_subnet" "example" {
  # Example: Select a subnet by name 
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = ["your-subnet-name"]
  }
}

# Elastic IP (for the static IP)
resource "aws_eip" "static_ip" {
  vpc = true 
}

# EC2 instance with static IP association
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.example_ami.id
  instance_type = "t2.micro" 
  subnet_id     = data.aws_subnet.example.id

  # Associate the Elastic IP
  network_interface {
    device_index = 0
    private_ips  = [aws_eip.static_ip.private_ip]
    associate_public_ip = true 
  }

  # (Optional) User data for bootstrapping your instance
  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              # Your instance setup commands here
              EOF

  tags = {
    Name = "web-server-with-static-ip"
  }
}
```

**Explanation**

1. **Provider:** Configures Terraform to use the AWS provider.
2. **Data Sources:**
   * `aws_ami`: Fetches the latest AMI created by your Packer template.
   * `aws_vpc`: Fetches your default VPC.
   * `aws_subnet`: Fetches a subnet (you'll need to adjust the filter).
3. **Elastic IP:**  Creates an Elastic IP address (this is your static public IP).
4. **EC2 Instance:**
   * Uses your Packer AMI's ID.
   * Launches into the selected subnet.
   * Associates the Elastic IP to its network interface.
   * Includes optional 'user_data' for instance setup.

**How to Use**

1.  **Replace placeholders:** Fill in "your-aws-region," subnet details, and adjust the AMI filter if needed.
2.  **Packer:** Ensure your Packer HCL template correctly builds and tags/names the AMI.
3.  **Terraform:**  Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply`

**Important Notes**

* **Coordination:** Packer and Terraform should be aligned (AMI names, regions, etc.).
* **Alternatives:** For dynamic IPs that are still persistent across stops/starts, consider `aws_instance` with `associate_public_ip = true` without the Elastic IP.
