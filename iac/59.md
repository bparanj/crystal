Provide Ansible playbook for installing and configuring Redis on Ubuntu 22.04

Here is an Ansible playbook to install and configure Redis on an Ubuntu 22.04 server. This playbook will perform the following actions:

1. **Install Redis**: This will ensure Redis is installed on your Ubuntu server.
2. **Configure Redis**: Modifies the Redis configuration file for custom settings.
3. **Restart and enable Redis**: Ensures Redis is running and enabled to start at boot.

You'll need to adjust the configuration settings according to your requirements. For this example, let's assume you want to bind Redis to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) and set the `maxmemory` policy.

```yaml
---
- name: Install and configure Redis on Ubuntu 22.04
  hosts: your_host_group
  become: yes  # Use sudo
  tasks:
    - name: Install Redis server
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: redis-server
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Update Redis configuration file
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /etc/redis/redis.conf
        regexp: '^{{ item.option }}'
        line: '{{ item.option }} {{ item.value }}'
        state: present
      loop:
        - { option: 'bind', value: '127.0.0.1' }
        - { option: 'maxmemory-policy', value: 'allkeys-lru' }
      notify: restart redis

    - name: Ensure Redis is running and enabled
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: redis-server
        state: started
        enabled: yes

  handlers:
    - name: restart redis
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: redis-server
        state: restarted
```

Before running the playbook:

- Replace `your_host_group` with the name of the group in your Ansible inventory that represents the Ubuntu 22.04 servers where you want Redis installed. You can also specify a single host.
- Adjust the configuration settings in the `loop` section under the "Update Redis configuration file" task as needed. The example provided sets Redis to listen on localhost and uses the `allkeys-lru` eviction policy when max memory is reached.
- Ensure you have Ansible installed on your control machine and that you have SSH access configured for the target machine(s).

To run this playbook, save it to a file (e.g., `install_redis.yml`) and execute it with the `ansible-playbook` command:

```sh
ansible-playbook install_redis.yml
```

This playbook provides a basic setup for Redis. Depending on your specific requirements, you may want to further customize the Redis configuration by adding more options to the loop under the "Update Redis configuration file" task.
