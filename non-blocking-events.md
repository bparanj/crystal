In JavaScript, the term "events are non-blocking" refers to the asynchronous nature of event handling. This is a key aspect of JavaScript's concurrency model, which is based on an event loop. Here's a breakdown of what this means:

1. **Event-Driven Programming**:
   - JavaScript is often used in an event-driven programming context, especially in web browsers and Node.js. 
   - In this paradigm, the flow of the program is determined by events such as user interactions, timer expirations, or incoming data.

2. **Non-Blocking Nature**:
   - When an event occurs, it does not block the execution of other parts of the program.
   - For instance, if a JavaScript function is set to run when a user clicks a button (`onClick` event), the browser can still handle other tasks like rendering or responding to other user inputs while waiting for this click event.

3. **Asynchronous Execution**:
   - JavaScript's runtime environment (like browsers or Node.js) generally has a single-threaded event loop. This means it can only do one thing at a time.
   - To avoid blocking this single thread, operations that take a long time to complete (like network requests or file reading in Node.js) are executed asynchronously. These operations are started, and then the program continues to run. When the operation finishes, an event is fired, triggering any callbacks associated with that operation.

4. **Callback Functions**:
   - In JavaScript, you often provide callback functions to handle these asynchronous events. A callback function is executed when the event it's associated with occurs, without blocking the main thread.
   - This non-blocking behavior allows JavaScript environments to remain responsive, handling user interface updates and other events while waiting for callbacks to execute.

5. **Example Scenario**:
   - Consider a scenario where a JavaScript program makes an AJAX request to fetch data from a server. The AJAX request is sent, and the program continues to run other code without waiting for the response. When the server responds, an event is triggered, and the callback function handling the response is executed.

In summary, "events are non-blocking" in JavaScript means that the program can continue running and remain responsive to other events while waiting for an event to trigger its associated action. This is a fundamental characteristic of JavaScript's design, enabling it to handle complex, asynchronous operations in a single-threaded environment.
