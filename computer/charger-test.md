### Step-by-Step Instructions to Test Your Lenovo Charger:

1. **Gather Tools:**
   - Obtain a multimeter, the charger you want to test, and ensure the charger is plugged into the wall outlet.

2. **Set Up Multimeter:**
   - Look at the multimeter dial and select the appropriate voltage setting.

3. **Prepare for Testing:**
   - Identify the voltage output specified on the charger block (e.g., 18.5 volts).

4. **Position Testers:**
   - Place the black tester on the outside of the charger connector.
   - Insert the red tester inside the charger connector, aiming to touch the gold post in the middle.

5. **Read Voltage:**
   - Observe the multimeter reading:
     - If it reads close to the specified voltage (within a margin of Â±0.5 volts), the charger is good.
     - For example, a reading of 19.04 volts for an 18.5-volt charger is acceptable.

6. **Identify Issues:**
   - If the voltage is significantly higher or lower than specified, the charger is faulty.

These steps will help you determine whether your Lenovo charger is functioning correctly.

Here are the step-by-step instructions to test a charger for a Lenovo computer:

1. Gather the necessary tools:
   - Multimeter
   - Red and black testers (probes)
   - Charger (plugged into the wall)

2. Set the multimeter dial to the appropriate voltage setting.

3. Check the voltage rating on the charger block. For example, if it reads 18.5 volts, the charger should output a voltage close to that value (within half a volt higher or lower).

4. Place the black tester (probe) on the outside of the charger.

5. Place the red tester (probe) on the inside of the charger, making sure it touches the gold post in the middle.

6. Read the voltage displayed on the multimeter:
   - If the voltage is within the margin of error (e.g., 19.04 volts for an 18.5-volt charger), the charger is working properly.
   - If the voltage is significantly different from the expected value, the charger may be faulty.

Note: If you don't have the necessary tools or feel uncomfortable testing the charger, you can always purchase a replacement charger. They are readily available and relatively inexpensive (around $10 on eBay).

If testing the charger doesn't resolve the issue with your Lenovo computer (e.g., battery not charging, computer turning on and off, freezing, or not turning on at all), proceed to the next troubleshooting step listed in the video description.
