Here is a concise table showing the OSI model layers and the terms used for data at each layer:

| OSI Layer           | Data Term              |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Application Layer    | Data / Message         |
| Presentation Layer   | Data (Encrypted/Formatted) |
| Session Layer        | Data / Stream          |
| Transport Layer      | Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP) |
| Network Layer        | Packet                 |
| Data Link Layer      | Frame                  |
| Physical Layer       | Bits                   |

This table summarizes the different terms used to describe the data at each layer as it moves through the OSI model.

In the **OSI model**, data is encapsulated and transformed as it moves through each layer from the bottom (physical layer) to the top (application layer). Here are the terms used at each layer to describe the data:

1. **Physical Layer**: Deals with **bits** (1s and 0s). The data is transmitted as electrical signals, light pulses, or radio waves.
   - **Data unit**: **Bits**

2. **Data Link Layer**: Organizes bits into **frames**. It handles error detection and correction and controls the flow of data over the physical medium.
   - **Data unit**: **Frames**

3. **Network Layer**: Deals with **packets**. This layer is responsible for logical addressing (such as IP addresses) and routing the data across different networks.
   - **Data unit**: **Packets**

4. **Transport Layer**: Works with **segments** (in TCP) or **datagrams** (in UDP). It ensures reliable transmission of data, managing flow control, and error recovery.
   - **Data unit**: **Segments** (TCP) / **Datagrams** (UDP)

5. **Session Layer**: Manages **data streams** by establishing, maintaining, and terminating sessions between applications.
   - **Data unit**: **Data** or **Messages**

6. **Presentation Layer**: Handles **data translation**, encryption, and compression. It formats the data for the application layer.
   - **Data unit**: **Data**

7. **Application Layer**: Deals with high-level application data, like HTTP requests or file transfers. This is the user-facing layer.
   - **Data unit**: **Data** or **Messages**

### Recap of Data Units at Each Layer:
1. **Physical**: Bits
2. **Data Link**: Frames
3. **Network**: Packets
4. **Transport**: Segments (TCP) or Datagrams (UDP)
5. **Session**: Data/Messages
6. **Presentation**: Data/Messages
7. **Application**: Data/Messages

As data moves **down** the OSI model, it is encapsulated into the appropriate unit (e.g., bits, frames, packets). When moving **up** the OSI model, each layer decapsulates its respective unit to retrieve the higher-level data.

Here's a breakdown of how **Data/Messages** differ between the layers where they seem similar but serve different purposes, particularly focusing on encryption, formatting, and other transformations.

### 1. **Application Layer**:
   - **Data/Messages**: This is the user-facing, high-level data exchanged between applications, like an HTTP request, email content, or file transfer data. This data is typically unprocessed in terms of encryption or compression by the network layers.
   - **Example**: Plain text, a file attachment, or a web page request.

### 2. **Presentation Layer**:
   - **Encrypted Data vs. Decrypted Data**:
     - **Encrypted Data**: If encryption is applied at this layer, the data is transformed into an encrypted format for security.
     - **Decrypted Data**: When the data moves up to the Presentation layer, it may be decrypted for proper handling by the application.
   - **Compressed Data vs. Decompressed Data**:
     - The Presentation layer can also **compress** or **decompress** data for more efficient transmission.
   - **Formatted Data**: The data is transformed for proper formatting between different systems, such as converting between different encoding formats (e.g., ASCII, EBCDIC, or image formats).
   - **Example**: Encrypted email content or image converted from one format to another.

### 3. **Session Layer**:
   - **Data Streams**: At this layer, data is managed in terms of maintaining or establishing sessions between applications. The data is usually unencrypted, but itâ€™s managed to ensure that streams are in sync and that communication sessions are properly maintained.
   - **Example**: Managing multiple requests in a web application session or maintaining a database connection.

### 4. **Transport Layer**:
   - **Segments (TCP) / Datagrams (UDP)**: Here, the focus is on the reliable delivery of data. The data from higher layers is segmented into smaller chunks for transmission (TCP segments or UDP datagrams). The content itself (data payload) can still be encrypted, but the main job of this layer is managing delivery.
   - **Flow-controlled Data**: In TCP, this layer manages data to ensure it's delivered in the correct order and without errors.
   - **Example**: A piece of a web page or file being transmitted in a TCP segment.

### 5. **Network Layer**:
   - **Packets**: This layer adds source and destination IP addresses to data, ensuring it gets routed across networks. The **data within the packet (payload)** can still be encrypted (if encryption was done in higher layers) or unencrypted.
   - **Example**: IP packet containing part of an email or web request.

### 6. **Data Link Layer**:
   - **Frames**: At this layer, the data is encapsulated into frames, which are passed over the physical network. Frames contain the actual payload (encrypted or not), along with **error-checking** and **MAC addresses** to ensure correct delivery within a local network.
   - **Error-Checked Data**: This layer adds error detection to ensure data integrity over the physical medium.
   - **Example**: Ethernet frame with data payload.

### 7. **Physical Layer**:
   - **Bits**: At this layer, data is simply represented as bits (1s and 0s) transmitted as electrical, optical, or radio signals over the physical medium.
   - **Example**: 10101001 (binary sequence representing part of a frame).

### Differences Between Similar Data:

- **Application Layer vs. Presentation Layer**: 
  - **Application Layer Data** is typically raw, readable by the user or application (e.g., an HTTP request or a plain text file).
  - **Presentation Layer Data** may involve **encrypted, decrypted, compressed, or formatted data**, preparing it for transmission or presentation.

- **Encrypted vs. Decrypted Data**: 
  - **Encrypted Data**: Transformed for security purposes (e.g., scrambled).
  - **Decrypted Data**: Reverted to its original form for proper use by the application (e.g., readable content).

- **Compressed vs. Uncompressed Data**: 
  - **Compressed Data**: Data is reduced in size for faster transmission.
  - **Decompressed Data**: Data is restored to its original size for accurate processing.

Each layer performs a specific function on the data it receives from the layer above or below, and the transformation is critical for ensuring the proper flow of data across the network.
