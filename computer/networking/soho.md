To express a /24 network prefix as a dotted decimal subnet mask, we convert the prefix notation to subnet mask format. Let's break this down:

1. Understanding /24:
   - In CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation, /24 means that the first 24 bits of the IP address are used for the network portion.
   - This leaves 8 bits for the host portion (as IPv4 addresses are 32 bits total).

2. Converting to binary:
   - A /24 subnet mask in binary would be:
     11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

3. Converting to decimal:
   - Each octet (8 bits) is converted to decimal:
     11111111 = 255
     11111111 = 255
     11111111 = 255
     00000000 = 0

4. The dotted decimal subnet mask:
   Therefore, a /24 network prefix expressed as a dotted decimal subnet mask is:

   255.255.255.0

This subnet mask allows for 256 total addresses (254 usable host addresses, plus network and broadcast addresses) in the local network.

The technology  sed by routers to forward packets from privately addressed LAN hosts over the WAN interface is Network Address Translation (NAT).

NAT allows a router to translate between private IP addresses used on the internal network and public IP addresses used on the internet. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1. When a device on the private LAN sends a packet to an external destination, it reaches the router.

2. The router modifies the source IP address in the packet header, replacing the private IP address with its own public IP address.

3. The router also keeps track of this translation in a NAT table, noting which internal IP and port correspond to which external port.

4. When a response comes back from the internet, the router uses its NAT table to determine which internal device should receive the packet.

5. It then translates the destination IP address back to the private IP address of the correct internal device before forwarding the packet.

This process allows multiple devices with private IP addresses to share a single public IP address, which is crucial given the limited number of available public IPv4 addresses.

There are several types of NAT:

1. Static NAT: One-to-one mapping between private and public IP addresses.
2. Dynamic NAT: A pool of public IP addresses is shared among private IP addresses.
3. Port Address Translation (PAT) or Network Address Port Translation (NAPT): Multiple private IP addresses share a single public IP address by using different ports.

To configure a PC host with static addressing on a LAN, the gateway parameter should be set to the IP address of the router's LAN interface. This address is the first usable IP address in the subnet.

Common default gateway addresses for home and small office networks include:

1. 192.168.0.1
2. 192.168.1.1
3. 10.0.0.1

To find the correct gateway address:

1. Check your router's configuration page
2. Look at the network settings of a device that's already correctly configured on the network
3. Use the "ipconfig" command (on Windows) or "ifconfig" (on Mac/Linux) on a working machine to see the gateway address
