The subnet mask for the IP address 192.168.1.1 is typically **255.255.255.0** if it follows the default Class C network standard. This allows for 256 IP addresses in the range 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255, with 192.168.1.1 as a usable host address.

The subnet mask **255.255.0.0** is typically associated with Class B networks, which are designed for larger networks with a range of IP addresses from **128.0.0.0** to **191.255.255.255**. These networks allow more host addresses, which makes them suitable for larger organizations.

On the other hand, **192.168.1.1** is part of the **Class C** private IP range (192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255). Class C networks typically use the subnet mask **255.255.255.0**, which provides 256 IP addresses (with 254 usable for hosts). This is enough for smaller networks like home or small business environments, which is why **255.255.255.0** is often used.

The key reason the subnet mask for **192.168.1.1** isn't **255.255.0.0** is because **255.255.0.0** would be used in larger networks, like Class B, and wouldn't be the default for a Class C private network.

No, by definition, Class B networks **do not** begin with 192.168.1.1.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of IP classes based on the first octet:

- **Class A**: 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0 (default subnet mask: 255.0.0.0)
- **Class B**: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0 (default subnet mask: 255.255.0.0)
- **Class C**: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0 (default subnet mask: 255.255.255.0)

Since the address **192.168.1.1** falls between **192.0.0.0** and **223.255.255.0**, it is part of a **Class C** network, not Class B. Therefore, the appropriate default subnet mask for this address is **255.255.255.0**. Class B networks start from **128.0.0.0** and end at **191.255.0.0**, which excludes the 192.x.x.x range.
