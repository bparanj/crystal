   - Zero out free space to reduce the image size (optional but recommended for efficiency).
     ```sh
     dd if=/dev/zero of=/EMPTY bs=1M
     rm -f /EMPTY
     ```
2. **Install Clonezilla**: Clonezilla is a free and open-source disk imaging and cloning tool.
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install clonezilla
   ```
3. **Create the Image**:
   - Boot into Clonezilla.
   - Select "device-image" mode to create an image of the disk.
   - Choose a location to save the image (external hard drive, network storage, etc.).
   - Follow the prompts to create an image of the entire disk.

### Step 3: Deploy the Image to Other Laptops
1. **Prepare the Target Laptops**:
   - Ensure each laptop is set to boot from a USB drive or network.
   - Connect an external hard drive or network storage containing the Clonezilla image.
2. **Boot into Clonezilla on Each Target Laptop**:

#### 4. **Final Steps**

1. **Test Each Laptop**:
   - Boot each laptop to ensure the image was deployed correctly and the system functions as expected.
   - Verify that the initial setup script runs (if implemented) and that the laptop is ready for a new user.

2. **Document Configuration**:
   - Provide instructions for the new users on how to complete the initial setup and configure their laptop.

### Example First-Boot Script

You can create a script that runs on the first boot to assist new users in setting up their laptop:

**/usr/local/bin/first-boot.sh**:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Welcome to your new laptop setup."
echo "Please follow the instructions to set up your user account."

read -p "Enter your desired username: " username
adduser $username

echo "Setup complete. Please restart your laptop to apply changes."
echo "sudo reboot"
```

Make this script executable and set it to run on the first boot:

```sh
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/first-boot.sh
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

Add the following line before `exit 0`:
```sh
/usr/local/bin/first-boot.sh
```
