2. **Enter BIOS/UEFI**: During the boot process, press the appropriate key to enter the BIOS/UEFI settings. Common keys include `F1`, `F2`, `F10`, `DEL`, or `ESC`. The specific key should be displayed briefly during the boot-up screen.
3. **Navigate to Storage Information**: Once in the BIOS/UEFI setup, look for a section related to storage devices. This section is often labeled as "Storage," "Hard Drive," "Boot Order," or something similar.
4. **Check for Hard Drive**: Here, you should see a list of installed storage devices. Look for entries that indicate the presence of a hard drive or SSD.

### Method 2: Using Disk Management in Windows
1. **Open Disk Management**: Press `Windows + X` and select "Disk Management" from the menu.
2. **View Installed Drives**: In the Disk Management window, you will see a graphical representation of all the storage devices connected to your laptop. Look for entries labeled as "Disk 0," "Disk 1," etc., which represent physical drives.

### Method 3: Using Device Manager

By following these steps, you can determine if your used ThinkPad Lenovo laptop has a hard drive installed.

To check if your used Thinkpad Lenovo laptop has a hard drive, you can try the following methods:

1. Check the device manager:
   - Turn on your laptop and wait for it to boot into Windows.
   - Right-click on the Start menu and select "Device Manager."
   - Look for the "Disk drives" section and expand it.
   - If you see a hard drive listed, then your laptop has a hard drive installed.

2. Check the BIOS:
   - Restart your laptop and press the appropriate key (usually F2, F10, or Del) to enter the BIOS setup.
   - Navigate to the "Main" or "System Information" section.
   - Look for information about the installed storage devices. If a hard drive is listed, your laptop has one.

3. Physically inspect the laptop:
   - Turn off your laptop and unplug it from any power source.
   - Remove the battery (if it's removable).
   - Locate the hard drive compartment on the bottom of your laptop (consult your laptop's manual if needed).
   - Remove the screws and open the hard drive compartment.
   - If you see a hard drive inside, then your laptop has one installed.

4. Use system information tools:
   - On Windows, press Win + R, type "msinfo32", and press Enter to open System Information.
   - Navigate to "Components" > "Storage" > "Disks".
   - If a hard drive is listed, your laptop has one.
   - On Linux, open a terminal and type "sudo lshw -class disk" to list the installed storage devices.

Some newer laptops might use solid-state drives (SSDs) instead of traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). SSDs have a similar appearance to HDDs but are usually smaller and have no moving parts.

Since your laptop was purchased from a recycling company, it’s likely the hard drive has been removed or wiped. Here are some steps you can take to confirm whether the hard drive is still present:

### Method 1: Check BIOS/UEFI
1. **Restart the Laptop**: Restart your ThinkPad.
2. **Enter BIOS/UEFI**: Press the appropriate key during the startup to enter the BIOS/UEFI settings. Common keys are `F1`, `F2`, `F10`, `ESC`, or `DEL`.
3. **Navigate to Storage Information**: Look for a section labeled "Storage," "Hard Drive," or "Boot Order."
4. **Check for Hard Drive**: See if any hard drive or SSD is listed. If nothing is listed, the hard drive might be missing.

### Method 2: Physical Inspection
1. **Turn Off the Laptop**: Power off your ThinkPad and disconnect it from the power source.
2. **Remove Battery (if applicable)**: If your model allows, remove the battery for safety.
3. **Locate Hard Drive Bay**: On the bottom of the laptop, find the panel that covers the hard drive bay. This panel is usually secured with screws.
4. **Open Hard Drive Bay**: Use a screwdriver to remove the screws and take off the panel.
5. **Inspect Hard Drive Slot**: Look inside to see if a hard drive or SSD is installed. If there is an empty slot, the hard drive has been removed.

### Method 3: Using Windows Disk Management (if you have another OS installed)
1. **Open Disk Management**: Press `Windows + X` and select "Disk Management."
2. **Check for Drives**: Look for any disks listed. If only your OS drive is listed and there is no other drive, it’s likely the hard drive is missing.

### Method 4: Using Device Manager
1. **Open Device Manager**: Press `Windows + X` and select "Device Manager."
2. **Expand Disk Drives**: Look under "Disk drives" to see if any additional hard drive is listed.

### Method 5: Using System Information
1. **Open System Information**: Press `Windows + R`, type `msinfo32`, and press Enter.
2. **Expand Components**: Go to "Components" and then "Storage" -> "Disks" to see if any additional hard drives are listed.

### Additional Tips
- **Consult the Laptop Manual**: If you're unsure about the location of the hard drive bay, refer to the laptop's manual or a guide online specific to your ThinkPad model.
- **Contact the Recycling Company**: If you are unsure or want confirmation, you could also contact the company you purchased the laptop from.

By following these steps, you should be able to determine if your used ThinkPad Lenovo laptop still has a hard drive installed or if it has been removed.

If you've purchased the laptop from a recycling company, it's possible that the hard drive has been removed for data security purposes. In this case, you'll need to physically inspect the laptop to determine if the hard drive is present or not. Here's what you can do:

1. Gather the necessary tools:
   - Phillips screwdriver (small or medium size)
   - Pry tool or flat-blade screwdriver (optional, for removing the cover)

2. Prepare your workspace:
   - Find a clean, well-lit area to work on your laptop.
   - Place the laptop on a soft, non-conductive surface to prevent scratches.

3. Remove the battery (if applicable):
   - If your laptop has a removable battery, remove it and set it aside.

4. Locate the hard drive compartment:
   - Turn the laptop over and look for a small compartment cover, usually secured with one or more screws.
   - The hard drive compartment is often labeled with a hard drive icon or the letters "HDD."

5. Remove the compartment cover:
   - Use the Phillips screwdriver to remove the screws holding the compartment cover in place.
   - Carefully lift the cover off, using a pry tool or flat-blade screwdriver if needed.

6. Inspect the hard drive bay:
   - Look inside the hard drive bay to see if a hard drive is installed.
   - If a hard drive is present, it will typically be a rectangular metal or plastic box with a SATA connector and power connector attached.
   - If the bay is empty, the hard drive has likely been removed.

7. Reassemble the laptop:
   - If you found a hard drive, replace the compartment cover and secure it with the screws.
   - If there was no hard drive, you can still replace the cover to protect the internal components.
   - Reinsert the battery (if applicable).

If you find that the hard drive is missing, you'll need to purchase and install a compatible hard drive or SSD if you want to use the laptop. Make sure to get the correct size and interface (usually 2.5-inch SATA) for your specific Thinkpad model.
