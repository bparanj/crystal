Deciding whether to replace the entire keyboard or just the keys that are not working depends on several factors. Here’s how to make an informed decision:

### Assess the Problem

1. **Extent of Non-Functional Keys**:
   - **Few Keys**: If only a few keys are not working, it might be feasible to replace just those keys.
   - **Multiple Keys**: If many keys or a section of the keyboard is not working, it may be more practical to replace the entire keyboard.

2. **Cause of the Problem**:
   - **Physical Damage**: Inspect for visible damage. If the keys are physically broken or missing, replacing individual keys might be sufficient.
   - **Internal Issues**: If the problem is due to internal issues like a faulty membrane or circuit, replacing the entire keyboard is often necessary.

3. **Age and Condition of the Keyboard**:
   - **Newer Keyboards**: For newer laptops, individual key replacement can be a good option, especially if the rest of the keyboard is in good condition.
   - **Older Keyboards**: For older keyboards that show signs of wear and tear, replacing the entire keyboard might be more cost-effective in the long run.

### Cost and Availability

1. **Individual Key Replacement**:
   - **Cost**: Generally cheaper if only a few keys need replacement.
   - **Availability**: Check if replacement keys for your specific Lenovo model are available. Some models may not have readily available replacement keys.

2. **Entire Keyboard Replacement**:
   - **Cost**: Can be more expensive, but ensures all keys are functional and can extend the life of the laptop.
   - **Availability**: Ensure the entire keyboard is available for your model. Lenovo keyboards are usually model-specific.

### Technical Skills and Tools

1. **Replacing Individual Keys**:
   - **Skill Level**: Requires moderate technical skills. You need to remove the faulty key and attach the new one correctly.
