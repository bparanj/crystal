These steps should help you troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue with your Lenovo laptop being stuck on the splash screen.

If your Lenovo laptop is stuck on the splash screen and won't boot into Windows, there could be several reasons. Here are some troubleshooting steps you can try:

1. Run Lenovo Diagnostics: Many Lenovo laptops have built-in diagnostic tools. As the laptop starts, press the "F10" or "Fn + F10" key repeatedly to enter the Lenovo diagnostics mode. This will check your hardware for any issues.

2. Boot into Safe Mode: Try booting into Safe Mode to see if the issue is caused by a problematic driver or software. To do this, turn your laptop off and on again, and when the Lenovo logo appears, press the "F8" key repeatedly until you see the boot options. Choose "Safe Mode" and see if your laptop boots.

3. Remove any external devices: Unplug any USB drives, external mouse, or other peripherals and try booting again.

4. Reset the BIOS: A misconfigured BIOS could cause boot issues. To reset the BIOS, enter the BIOS setup (usually by pressing "F2" or "Delete" key while booting), then look for an option to reset the BIOS to default settings.

5. Check your hard drive: A corrupted or failing hard drive can cause boot issues. In the BIOS setup, look for a tool to check your hard drive's health.

6. Use Lenovo's OneKey Recovery: Many Lenovo laptops have a recovery partition that can help fix boot issues. Turn your laptop off, then press the Novo button (a small button next to the power button) to enter the Novo Menu. Select "System Recovery" and follow the prompts.

7. Reinstall Windows: If all else fails, you may need to reinstall Windows. You'll need a Windows installation media (USB drive or DVD) for this. Boot from the media and follow the instructions to reinstall Windows.

If none of these steps work, there may be a hardware issue like a faulty hard drive or RAM. In this case, you might need to take your laptop to a professional for repair.
