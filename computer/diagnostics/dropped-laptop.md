If your laptop's screen is black after a fall but everything else seems to work, it indicates that the display might have been damaged or there could be a loose connection. Here's a systematic approach to diagnose and potentially fix the issue:

### Steps to Diagnose and Fix the Issue

#### 1. **Check for External Damage**
- **Inspect the Screen**: Even if there are no visible cracks, check for any subtle signs of damage or abnormalities on the screen surface.
- **Hinges and Frame**: Ensure the hinges and the frame of the laptop are intact and not misaligned.

#### 2. **Test with an External Monitor**
- **Connect to External Monitor**: Use an HDMI or VGA cable to connect your laptop to an external monitor or TV.
  - **Display on External Monitor**: If the external monitor works, the issue is likely with your laptop’s screen or its connections.
  - **No Display on External Monitor**: If the external monitor doesn’t work, there might be an internal hardware issue.

#### 3. **Reset the Laptop**
- **Perform a Hard Reset**:
  - Turn off the laptop and unplug it from any power source.
  - Remove the battery if it’s removable.
  - Press and hold the power button for 30 seconds to discharge any residual power.
  - Reconnect the battery and power adapter, then try turning on the laptop.

#### 4. **Check Internal Connections (If Comfortable)**
- **Open the Laptop**: If you are comfortable and have the necessary tools, you can open the laptop to check for loose connections.
  - **Reconnect Display Cable**: Locate the display cable connecting the screen to the motherboard and ensure it’s securely connected.
  - **Inspect for Damage**: Look for any obvious signs of damage to the cable or connectors.

#### 5. **Backlight and Inverter Check**
- **Dim Screen Test**: Shine a flashlight at an angle on the screen to see if there’s a faint image. If you see a dim image, the backlight or inverter might be faulty.

### Deciding Between DIY Repair and Professional Help

#### DIY Repair:
- **Comfort with Hardware**: If you are experienced with laptop hardware and have the necessary tools, you might be able to fix the issue yourself.
  - **Reconnecting Cables**: Sometimes, reseating the display cable or checking connections can resolve the issue.
  - **Replacing Parts**: If the screen or cable is damaged, you might be able to order replacement parts and install them.

#### Professional Repair:
- **Uncertain Diagnosis**: If you are unsure about diagnosing the issue or if the problem persists after checking connections, it’s best to seek professional help.
- **Warranty Consideration**: If your laptop is under warranty, contact Lenovo support for repair options.
- **Complex Repairs**: Issues with the motherboard or internal components might require specialized tools and expertise.

### Conclusion

Start by performing basic checks like connecting to an external monitor and inspecting for loose connections. If these steps do not resolve the issue, and you are not comfortable with further disassembly, it’s advisable to take your laptop to a professional repair shop. They can provide a more thorough diagnosis and ensure that the repair is done correctly.
