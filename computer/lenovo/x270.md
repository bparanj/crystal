To determine if the INLAND M.2 2242 512GB SSD NVMe PCIe Gen 3x4 Internal Solid State Drive will work for your ThinkPad X270, let's break down the compatibility aspects:

### Key Specifications of the SSD:
- **Form Factor**: M.2 2242
- **Capacity**: 512GB
- **Interface**: NVMe PCIe Gen 3x4
- **Read/Write Speed**: Up to 2,400/1,700 MB/s

### ThinkPad X270 SSD Compatibility:
- **Form Factor**: The ThinkPad X270 uses an M.2 slot that supports 2242 and 2280 form factors. The 2242 form factor of the INLAND SSD is compatible.
- **Interface**: The ThinkPad X270 supports M.2 PCIe NVMe SSDs. However, it supports PCIe 3.0 x2 lanes, which means it will not fully utilize the x4 lanes capability of the INLAND SSD but will still be compatible and functional.
- **Bandwidth**: The ThinkPad X270's M.2 slot supports PCIe 3.0 x2 lanes, which provides up to 16Gb/s bandwidth. The read/write speeds of the INLAND SSD will be limited by this bandwidth but should still offer a significant performance improvement over traditional SATA SSDs.

### Conclusion:
Yes, the INLAND M.2 2242 512GB SSD NVMe PCIe Gen 3x4 Internal Solid State Drive should work in your ThinkPad X270. While the laptop supports PCIe 3.0 x2, which won't utilize the full potential of the PCIe 3.0 x4 lanes of the SSD, the drive will still function properly and offer enhanced performance.

### Installation Tips:
1. **Backup Data**: Ensure you backup any important data before installation.
2. **Tools Required**: You will need a small screwdriver to open the laptop case.
3. **Installation Guide**: Follow Lenovo's official documentation or a detailed online guide specific to the ThinkPad X270 to install the M.2 SSD.

This compatibility analysis ensures that the chosen SSD fits the physical slot and uses a compatible interface with your ThinkPad X270.

Based on the specifications you've provided for both the INLAND SSD and the ThinkPad X270, this SSD should be compatible, but there are a few important points to consider:

1. Form Factor:
   - The INLAND SSD is M.2 2242, which matches the X270's requirement.

2. Interface:
   - The INLAND SSD uses PCIe Gen 3x4 NVMe.
   - The X270 supports PCIe 3.0 x2.

3. Speed:
   - The SSD is capable of speeds up to 2,400/1,700 MB/s.
   - The X270's PCIe 3.0 x2 interface will limit the maximum speed to about half of what the SSD is capable of.

4. Capacity:
   - 512GB is supported by the X270.

Key Considerations:

1. Interface Compatibility:
   - While the SSD is PCIe 3.0 x4, it will work in a PCIe 3.0 x2 slot, just at reduced speeds.

2. Performance:
   - You won't get the full speed potential of the SSD due to the X270's x2 lanes, but it will still be faster than a SATA SSD.

3. Power Consumption:
   - NVMe SSDs can consume more power than SATA SSDs, which might slightly impact battery life.

Conclusion:
This INLAND M.2 2242 512GB SSD should work in your ThinkPad X270. It will be compatible and functional, but you won't get its full speed potential due to the laptop's PCIe 3.0 x2 limitation. However, it will still provide a significant performance boost over a standard SATA SSD.
