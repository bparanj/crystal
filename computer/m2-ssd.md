M.2 is a form factor specification for solid state drives (SSDs) and other expansion cards that enables high-performance storage in a compact form. Here are the key points about M.2:

1. **Form Factor**:
   - **Compact Size**: M.2 drives are designed to be small and thin, making them suitable for use in laptops, ultrabooks, and desktops with limited space.
   - **Dimensions**: Common sizes include 2230, 2242, 2260, 2280, and 22110, where the first two digits represent the width in millimeters (22 mm) and the remaining digits represent the length (e.g., 80 mm for 2280).

2. **Interface**:
   - **SATA**: M.2 drives can use the SATA interface, similar to traditional 2.5-inch SSDs, but with a different connector.
   - **PCIe**: M.2 drives can also use the PCI Express (PCIe) interface, which offers higher data transfer speeds compared to SATA. PCIe M.2 drives may support NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) protocol, providing even faster performance.

3. **Performance**:
   - **Higher Speeds**: M.2 drives using the PCIe interface, especially those with NVMe support, can achieve significantly higher read and write speeds compared to SATA-based drives.
   - **Latency**: Lower latency is another benefit of NVMe M.2 drives, improving overall system responsiveness.

4. **Compatibility**:
   - **Motherboard Support**: Ensure your motherboard has an M.2 slot that supports the desired interface (SATA or PCIe) and size of the M.2 drive.
   - **Keying**: M.2 drives come with different key types (e.g., B-key, M-key, B+M key) that determine compatibility with the M.2 slot on the motherboard.

5. **Usage**:
   - **Boot Drives**: Due to their high speed and compact size, M.2 SSDs are often used as primary boot drives in modern computers.
   - **Storage Expansion**: They are also used for additional high-speed storage in systems with limited space.

In summary, M.2 is a versatile and high-performance form factor for SSDs, offering advantages in speed, size, and compatibility for various computing devices.
