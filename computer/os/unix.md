In UNICS, "uniplexed" means that the operating system was designed to handle one process at a time. 

The term "uniplexed" comes from "uni-" meaning "one" and "plexed" derived from "plexus," meaning network or connection. In the early development of UNIX, the system was simpler and designed to run one task or process at a time, hence "uniplexed." 

Later versions of UNIX evolved to support multitasking, allowing multiple processes to run concurrently, but the original name reflected the simplicity and focus of the system's early design.

UNIX does not have an official expansion as it is not an acronym. The name "UNIX" is a play on the earlier operating system name "Multics" (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service). When Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie were developing UNIX, they initially named it "UNICS," which stood for "Uniplexed Information and Computing Service," reflecting its simpler, single-tasking design compared to Multics. Over time, the name evolved into "UNIX." 

In essence, "UNIX" is more of a trademarked name than an acronym, and its usage has evolved beyond any specific expansion.
