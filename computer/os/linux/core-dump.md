What is a core dump in Linux?

A core dump in Linux is a file that captures the memory, register values, and call stack of a program at the moment it crashes. This is automatically generated by the Linux kernel when a program terminates unexpectedly.

- **Purpose**: Core dumps are primarily used for debugging. They provide a snapshot of the program's state at the time of the crash, which can be analyzed to determine the cause of the failure.
- **Contents**: The core dump file contains the process's address space (memory), including the values of registers and the call stack.
- **Generation**: Core dumps can be triggered by certain signals (e.g., `SIGSEGV` for segmentation faults) or manually using debugging tools.
- **Configuration**: The behavior of core dumps can be configured using the `kernel.core_pattern` parameter and other settings in `/etc/sysctl.conf` or `/etc/security/limits.conf`.
