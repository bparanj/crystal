What are builtin commands in Linux?

Built-in commands in Linux are commands that are executed directly by the shell itself, without requiring external binaries or utilities. These commands are part of the shell's internal functionality and are designed to handle tasks related to shell operations or environment management.

Examples:

- **`cd`**: Change the current directory.
- **`echo`**: Display a line of text.
- **`export`**: Set or export environment variables.
- **`exit`**: Exit the current shell session.
- **`alias`**: Create shortcuts for commands.

Since they are part of the shell, built-in commands typically execute faster than external utilities because the shell doesn't need to start a separate process to run them.
