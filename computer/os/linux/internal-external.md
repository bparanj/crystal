In Linux, commands are categorized as **internal** (built-in) and **external** because of where and how they are executed within the system:

### 1. **Internal (Built-in) Commands**:

Internal commands are part of the **shell** itself. They are built into the shell (like Bash) and do not require any external program to run. These commands are directly executed by the shell without creating a new process.

**Examples of internal commands**:
- `cd`: Change directory.
- `exit`: Exit the shell.
- `export`: Set environment variables.

**Why categorized as internal**:
- **Faster execution**: Since internal commands are part of the shell, they run more quickly because no additional process needs to be launched.
- **System control**: Many internal commands are used for controlling the shell environment itself (e.g., `cd`, `set`, `alias`), which external commands can't directly manage.

### 2. **External Commands**:
External commands are separate programs or binaries stored in the file system (usually in directories like `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, or `/sbin`). When an external command is run, the shell looks for the program in these directories, starts a new process, and executes it.

**Examples of external commands**:
- `ls`: List directory contents.
- `grep`: Search through text.
- `find`: Search for files.

**Why categorized as external**:
- **Separate binaries**: External commands are standalone programs that are executed by the shell but exist independently from it.
- **Flexibility**: External commands allow for more complex functionalities, as they are separate executables written for specific purposes and not limited to shell management.

### Key Differences:
- **Internal commands** are faster and are focused on managing the shell and its environment.
- **External commands** are typically more powerful and versatile since they are standalone programs but take slightly longer to execute due to the overhead of starting a new process.

This distinction helps manage the shell's internal workings efficiently while allowing more flexibility through external programs.
