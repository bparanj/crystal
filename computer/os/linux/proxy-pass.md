The proxy_pass directive in Nginx is used to forward client requests to another server. It’s commonly used in reverse proxy setups, where Nginx acts as an intermediary between clients and backend servers.

Here’s a basic example of how it’s used:

location / {
    proxy_pass http://example.com;
}

In this configuration, any request to the root URL (“/”) will be forwarded to http://example.com1.

Key Points:
Context: The proxy_pass directive is typically placed inside a location block, but it can also be used in server or http blocks1.
URL Handling: The URL specified in proxy_pass can be a complete URL or just a protocol and host. If it’s a complete URL, the path part of the request is replaced by the path in the proxy_pass URL2.
Variables: You can use variables in the proxy_pass directive, but if you do, you need to specify a resolver to handle DNS resolution.
