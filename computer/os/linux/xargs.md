Let's break down the command `find /etc/nginx -type d | xargs ls -ld`:

1. **`find /etc/nginx -type d`**:
   - `find` is a command used to search for files and directories.
   - `/etc/nginx` specifies the directory to search within.
   - `-type d` tells `find` to look for directories only.

2. **`|` (pipe)**:
   - The pipe symbol `|` takes the output of the command on its left (`find /etc/nginx -type d`) and uses it as the input for the command on its right (`xargs ls -ld`).

3. **`xargs ls -ld`**:
   - `xargs` is a command that builds and executes command lines from standard input.
   - `ls -ld` lists the details of directories. The `-l` option provides a long listing format, and the `-d` option ensures that directories themselves are listed, not their contents.

In summary, this command finds all directories within `/etc/nginx` and then lists detailed information about each of those directories.
