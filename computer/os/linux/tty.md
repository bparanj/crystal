What is tty in Linux?

In Linux, **`tty`** stands for "teletypewriter," which historically referred to physical terminals connected to a computer. Today, it represents any terminal device that interacts with the system.

A **`tty`** in modern Linux systems refers to a text input/output environment, whether it's a physical terminal, a virtual console (like those accessed via `Ctrl+Alt+F1`), or a pseudo-terminal (used by terminal emulators like `gnome-terminal` or `xterm`).

Uses of `tty`:

1. **Identifying terminals**: Running the `tty` command in a terminal will tell you which terminal device you're using (e.g., `/dev/tty1`, `/dev/pts/0`).
2. **Pseudo-terminals (PTY)**: Terminal emulators use PTYs to provide terminal-like functionality for user applications.

The `tty` system manages terminal input and output for processes, helping them communicate with users.

What does a teletype look like?

A **teletypewriter (TTY)** looks like a large, mechanical typewriter with an integrated communication system. It was originally used for sending and receiving typed messages over telegraph or phone lines. Here's what it generally looked like:

1. **Keyboard**: Similar to a typewriter, with physical keys for letters, numbers, and symbols.
2. **Printer Mechanism**: Instead of a display screen, early TTYs used a printer that typed the incoming and outgoing messages onto paper. The printer was often a continuous-feed roll.
3. **Paper Feed**: A roll of paper or individual sheets to print the output.
4. **Mechanical Parts**: It contained gears, levers, and motors to handle the typing and printing process.
5. **Communication Interface**: It connected to communication lines (e.g., telegraph lines, later telephone lines) for sending and receiving typed messages.

They were bulky, noisy machines, often used in newsrooms, government offices, and early computing environments to send data and receive printed output. Later versions became electronic, but the early ones were entirely mechanical.

The name of the first commercially successful teletypewriter was the **Morkrum Model 12**, developed by the **Morkrum Company** in the early 1900s. It was the result of a collaboration between electrical engineer Howard Krum and mechanical engineer Charles L. Krum. 

Their invention became a foundation for modern telecommunication devices, leading to the formation of the **Teletype Corporation** in 1928. The Teletype Model 12 was a significant step in automating telegraphy, moving away from manual Morse code operations.

Yes, early **mainframe computers** did use teletypewriters as input and output devices. Before the advent of more advanced terminals, **teletypes (TTYs)** were used to interact with mainframes, providing a way to type commands and receive printed responses.

The teletype served as:

1. **Input**: Users could type commands, programs, or data on the teletype's keyboard to interact with the mainframe.
2. **Output**: The results from the mainframe were printed on paper by the teletype, as screens were not yet widely used for displaying information.

As computing technology advanced, teletypes were gradually replaced by **video display terminals (VDTs)** and more sophisticated input/output devices, but they played a crucial role in the early days of computing.
