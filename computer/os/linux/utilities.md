What language is pwd, ls, cat and other commands in Linux implemented?

The `pwd`, `ls`, `cat`, and many other basic Linux commands are implemented in **C**. These commands are part of the GNU core utilities, and C is  used because it's a low-level language that provides high performance and direct interaction with the operating system's kernel.

## Linux Utilities

What are utilities in Linux?

Utilities in Linux are small programs or tools designed to perform specific tasks, often related to system management and file manipulation. They are part of the operating system's user-space software and allow users to interact with the system, perform basic operations, and manage resources.

Examples:

- **File management**: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`
- **Text processing**: `cat`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed`
- **System monitoring**: `top`, `ps`, `df`, `du`
- **Network utilities**: `ping`, `netstat`, `ifconfig`

These utilities are found in the GNU core utilities package on Linux systems.
