## System Instance

In Linux, the term **system instance** can refer to a few different concepts depending on the context:

### **Systemd Instance**
- **Definition**: Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It initializes the system and manages system processes after booting. A system instance of systemd is the primary instance that starts during the boot process and manages system-wide services³.
- **Purpose**: It handles the initialization of the system, starting and stopping services, and managing system states.

### **Virtual Machine Instance**
- **Definition**: In the context of virtualization, a system instance can refer to a virtual machine (VM) instance. This is a virtualized environment that runs its own operating system and applications, isolated from the host system.
- **Purpose**: VMs are used to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine, providing flexibility and efficient resource utilization².

### **Container Instance**
- **Definition**: A container instance refers to a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
- **Purpose**: Containers are used to deploy applications consistently across different environments, ensuring that they run the same way regardless of where they are deployed.
