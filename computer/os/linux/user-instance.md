## User Instance

In Linux, a **user instance** typically refers to a specific instance of a user account or a user session. Here are a couple of contexts where this term might be used:

### **User Account Instance**
- **Definition**: This is an individual user account created on the system. Each user account has unique properties such as a username, user ID (UID), group ID (GID), home directory, and default shell.
- **Purpose**: User accounts are used to manage permissions and access control, ensuring that each user has the appropriate level of access to system resources.

### **User Session Instance**
- **Definition**: This refers to an active session where a user is logged into the system. Each session can be tracked and managed independently.
- **Purpose**: User sessions allow multiple users to be logged in simultaneously, each with their own environment and processes.
