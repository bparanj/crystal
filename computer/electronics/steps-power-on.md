## Steps after Power On

Here are the high-level steps that occur when you turn on a laptop:

1. **Power On**: When you press the power button, the laptop's power supply sends electricity to all the components, including the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and storage devices⁴.

2. **POST (Power-On Self Test)**: The CPU initiates a self-test to check the basic hardware components like RAM, CPU, and storage. If any critical hardware is missing or malfunctioning, the process stops and an error is displayed⁵.

3. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization**: The CPU loads the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) firmware from a chip on the motherboard. This firmware initializes the hardware and prepares the system for booting.

4. **Bootloader Activation**: The BIOS/UEFI hands control over to the bootloader, which is a small program responsible for loading the operating system. The bootloader is typically stored on the primary storage device.

5. **Operating System Load**: The bootloader loads the operating system (like Windows, macOS, or Linux) into the computer's memory. The operating system then takes over, initializing its own processes and drivers.

6. **User Login**: Once the operating system is fully loaded, the login screen appears, allowing you to enter your credentials and start using the laptop.

These steps happen very quickly, often in just a few seconds, thanks to modern hardware and efficient firmware.
