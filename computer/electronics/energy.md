Here are the different types of energy:

1. **Kinetic Energy** - Energy of motion.
2. **Potential Energy** - Stored energy due to position.
3. **Thermal Energy** - Energy from heat.
4. **Chemical Energy** - Energy stored in chemical bonds.
5. **Electrical Energy** - Energy from electric charges.
6. **Nuclear Energy** - Energy stored in atomic nuclei.
7. **Radiant Energy** - Energy from electromagnetic waves (light).
8. **Mechanical Energy** - Sum of kinetic and potential energy in a system.
9. **Sound Energy** - Energy carried by sound waves.

Each type of energy can be converted from one form to another.

The unit of energy for all these types is the **Joule (J)**.

All types of energy use the Joule as a unit because energy, regardless of its form, is a measure of the ability to perform work. The Joule is defined as the amount of work done when a force of one newton displaces an object by one meter in the direction of the force. This standardization allows for consistent measurement and comparison of different energy forms.
