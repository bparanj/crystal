The terms **cathode** and **anode** for the ends of a diode come from the early study of electricity and electrochemistry, particularly from the terminology used in describing electrochemical cells.

### Origin of the Terms:

1. **Cathode**:
   - The term **cathode** comes from the Greek word *kathodos*, meaning "downward path."
   - In an electrochemical cell, the cathode is the electrode where **reduction** (gain of electrons) occurs. Electrons flow into the cathode from the external circuit, meaning it's where positive ions move towards.
   - For a diode, the cathode is the end where conventional current (flow of positive charge) exits the device, and where electrons actually enter the diode. In a diode's symbol, the cathode is marked by a line.

2. **Anode**:
   - The term **anode** comes from the Greek word *anodos*, meaning "upward path."
   - In an electrochemical cell, the anode is the electrode where **oxidation** (loss of electrons) occurs. Electrons flow out of the anode to the external circuit, meaning it's where negative ions move away from.
   - For a diode, the anode is the end where conventional current enters the device, and where electrons leave the diode. In a diode's symbol, the anode is represented by the triangle pointing towards the cathode.

### Application to Diodes:

- **Forward Bias (Conducting State)**: When a diode is forward-biased (positive voltage applied to the anode relative to the cathode), current flows easily from the anode to the cathode.
- **Reverse Bias (Non-Conducting State)**: When a diode is reverse-biased (positive voltage applied to the cathode relative to the anode), it prevents current from flowing, except in special cases like Zener diodes where reverse breakdown occurs.

### Summary:
The names **cathode** and **anode** originate from electrochemistry and were adopted in electronics to describe the terminals of devices like diodes. The **cathode** is where electrons enter the diode, and the **anode** is where they leave, corresponding to the direction of current flow when the diode is conducting.
