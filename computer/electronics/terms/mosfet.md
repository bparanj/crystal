A **MOSFET** (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) is a type of transistor used to amplify or switch electronic signals. Here are some key points about MOSFETs:

1. **Structure**: A MOSFET has three main terminals: the **source**, **drain**, and **gate**. It also has a fourth terminal called the **body** or **substrate**, which is often connected to the source.

2. **Operation**: The MOSFET operates by applying a voltage to the gate terminal, which creates an electric field that controls the flow of current between the source and drain terminals. This makes it a voltage-controlled device.

3. **Types**: There are two main types of MOSFETs:
   - **Enhancement Mode**: Requires a voltage at the gate to conduct.
   - **Depletion Mode**: Conducts when no voltage is applied to the gate and stops conducting when a voltage is applied.

4. **Applications**: MOSFETs are widely used in various applications, including power supplies, amplifiers, and digital circuits. They are particularly valued for their efficiency and high-speed switching capabilities.

5. **Advantages**: Compared to other types of transistors, MOSFETs have high input impedance and low output capacitance, making them ideal for high-speed and low-power applications.
