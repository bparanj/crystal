A form factor refers to the physical size, shape, and layout of a device or component, such as a computer case, motherboard, or other parts. It determines how different components fit together and how they work together within the system.

For example, in computers, form factors can dictate the dimensions and mounting points of motherboards, the size and shape of hard drives, and the overall design of cases. This standardization ensures compatibility between different components from various manufacturers.

The latest form factor of PC motherboards is ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended), with some newer variations like microATX, mini-ITX, and extended ATX (EATX) catering to different needs in terms of size and functionality. The ATX form factor, introduced by Intel in 1995, has become the most common and versatile standard, offering a balanced layout for performance, expansion, and cooling.

### Timeline of PC Motherboard Form Factors

1. **1981 - IBM PC/XT (XT)**: The earliest form factor, used in the original IBM PCs.
2. **1983 - IBM PC/AT (AT)**: Introduced with the IBM AT, it was larger than XT and set the stage for future designs.
3. **1995 - ATX**: Developed by Intel, the ATX form factor became the standard due to its improved layout for airflow, expansion slots, and ease of assembly.
4. **1997 - microATX**: A smaller version of ATX, designed to fit in smaller cases while maintaining compatibility with standard ATX components.
5. **2001 - FlexATX**: An even smaller version, aimed at compact systems, but less  used today.
6. **2001 - mini-ITX**: Introduced by VIA Technologies, this form factor is designed for very compact systems, popular in HTPCs and small form-factor PCs.
7. **2004 - BTX (Balanced Technology eXtended)**: Also developed by Intel to improve thermal management, but it didn't gain widespread adoption and was eventually phased out.
8. **Extended ATX (EATX)**: A larger version of ATX for high-end motherboards with additional features, often used in workstations and gaming rigs.

The ATX form factor remains the most widely used and versatile, with microATX and mini-ITX providing options for smaller builds, and EATX catering to high-performance systems with more extensive requirements.

The latest form factor for PC motherboards is the ATX12VO (Advanced Technology eXtended 12 Volt Only) standard. It was introduced by Intel in 2019 and is designed to improve power efficiency and simplify power supply design in modern PCs.

Here's a timeline of the major PC motherboard form factors:

1. AT (Advanced Technology): Introduced by IBM in 1984.
2. Baby AT: A smaller version of the AT form factor, introduced in the late 1980s.
3. ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended): Introduced by Intel in 1995, which became the most common form factor for desktop PCs.
4. microATX: A smaller version of ATX, introduced in 1997.
5. Mini-ITX: An even smaller form factor, introduced by VIA Technologies in 2001.
6. BTX (Balanced Technology eXtended): Introduced by Intel in 2004 as an alternative to ATX, but it did not gain widespread adoption.
7. Mini-DTX: A smaller version of DTX (a variant of BTX), introduced in 2007.
8. Mini-STX: Introduced by Intel in 2015 for small form factor PCs.
9. ATX12VO: Introduced by Intel in 2019, with a focus on improved power efficiency.

It's worth noting that while ATX12VO is the latest form factor, ATX and its variations (microATX and Mini-ITX) are still widely used in modern PCs due to their compatibility with a wide range of components and cases.

None of the form factors mentioned above are directly used in laptops. Laptops use proprietary motherboard designs that are specifically tailored to fit the chassis and components of each laptop model. These motherboards are designed to be compact, lightweight, and power-efficient to meet the unique requirements of portable computers.

However, some laptop motherboards may share similar design principles or power connector specifications with desktop form factors. For example:

1. Some high-performance gaming laptops or mobile workstations may use motherboards with power connectors similar to those found in ATX or ATX12VO desktop motherboards.

2. The Mobile-ITX form factor, introduced by VIA Technologies in 2009, was designed for small, low-power laptops and mobile devices. However, it did not gain widespread adoption.

In general, laptop motherboards are not standardized like desktop form factors, as they are designed to fit specific laptop models and are not  interchangeable between different laptops or brands.
