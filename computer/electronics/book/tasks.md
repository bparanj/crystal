- Work backwards from experiments
		- Order existing experiments from simple to complex. First pass done.
		- Write down the components used in each experiment. Refer the 0.jpg.
		- Explain each component used in the experiment.
		- Use the questions in template.md to cover the detailed explanation.
- Copy the projects in the whiteboard to this document
- 1 concept - 1 experiment. Then n concepts - 1 experiment. Finally a mini-project at the end of a section.
- Add the system concept.
		- What is a system
		- What are the elements in a system
		- How does this circuit map to a system?
- Refer simulation, run real experiments, take photos
- Review instructables for hackerboxes and take notes about using breadboard. Create diagrams to illustrate the connections.
- Review Zettels and extract basic level content for different chapters
- Refer electronics encyclopedia book and note down categorization

Scope

- No discussuion of any laws (only basic high level principles)
- No IC
- No coding
- Discrete components
- 90% practical, 10% theory
- No discussion of topics not in Tinkercad basic section
