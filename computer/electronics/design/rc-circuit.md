### Revised RC Circuit Experiment (for 5V battery)

#### Materials:
- 1 Resistor (e.g., 10kΩ)
- 1 Capacitor (e.g., 100μF)
- 1 Power source (5V battery)
- 1 Switch
- Connecting wires
- Multimeter (to measure voltage across the capacitor)
- Breadboard (optional for easy assembly)

#### Circuit Setup:
1. **Connect the resistor** in series with the capacitor.
2. **Connect the 5V battery** to the circuit.
3. **Place the switch** in series with the resistor and capacitor.
4. Connect a multimeter across the capacitor to measure its voltage.

### Procedure:

1. **Step 1: Charging the capacitor**
   - Close the switch to allow current to flow through the circuit.
   - Measure the voltage across the capacitor using the multimeter.
   - Observe how the voltage across the capacitor increases from 0V to 5V as the capacitor charges.

2. **Step 2: Discharging the capacitor**
   - Open the switch to disconnect the power source.
   - Watch the multimeter again and observe how the voltage across the capacitor decreases over time, eventually reaching 0V.

### Key Observations:
- The capacitor will charge up to **5V** and discharge back to 0V.
- The time constant (τ = R × C) will determine how fast the capacitor charges and discharges.
