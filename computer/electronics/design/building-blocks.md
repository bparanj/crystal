The basic building blocks in electronics are fundamental components and concepts that form the foundation of all electronic circuits and devices. These building blocks include both passive and active components, each playing a role in the design and operation of electronic systems.

### 1. **Resistors**
   - **Function**: Resistors limit or regulate the flow of electric current in a circuit. They are used to control voltage levels, divide voltages, and limit current to safe levels for other components.

### 2. **Capacitors**
   - **Function**: Capacitors store and release electrical energy in the form of an electric field. They are used in filtering, timing, and energy storage applications.

### 3. **Inductors**
   - **Function**: Inductors store energy in a magnetic field when current flows through them. They are used in filtering, energy storage, and inductive coupling applications.

### 4. **Diodes**
   - **Function**: Diodes allow current to flow in one direction only, acting as one-way valves for electric current. They are used in rectification, voltage regulation, and signal clipping.

### 5. **Transistors**
   - **Function**: Transistors act as switches or amplifiers, controlling the flow of current between two terminals based on an input signal at a third terminal. They are the fundamental building blocks of digital and analog circuits.

### 6. **Integrated Circuits (ICs)**
   - **Function**: ICs are complex circuits that integrate multiple electronic components (like transistors, resistors, capacitors) onto a single semiconductor chip. They perform a wide range of functions, from basic logic operations to complex signal processing.

### 7. **Transformers**
   - **Function**: Transformers transfer electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction, often used to step up or step down voltage levels.

### 8. **Switches**
   - **Function**: Switches control the flow of current in a circuit by opening or closing the circuit path. They are fundamental in controlling power to different parts of a circuit.
   - **Symbol**: ![Switch Symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Switch_symbol_spdt_1.svg/120px-Switch_symbol_spdt_1.svg.png)

### 9. **Power Sources (Batteries, Power Supplies)**
   - **Function**: Power sources provide the necessary electrical energy to a circuit. They can be DC (batteries) or AC (mains power supplies).
   - **Symbol**: ![Battery Symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Battery_symbol.svg/120px-Battery_symbol.svg.png)

### 10. **Relays**
   - **Function**: Relays are electrically operated switches that use an electromagnet to open or close a circuit. They allow low-power circuits to control high-power devices.
   - **Symbol**: ![Relay Symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Relay_symbol_SPDT-NO_%28_%29.svg/120px-Relay_symbol_SPDT-NO_%28_%29.svg.png)

### 11. **Oscillators**
   - **Function**: Oscillators generate periodic waveforms (such as sine waves or square waves) that are used in timing applications, signal generation, and clock circuits in digital systems.
   - **Symbol**: ![Oscillator Symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Oscillator_symbol.svg/120px-Oscillator_symbol.svg.png)

### 12. **Sensors**
   - **Function**: Sensors detect physical quantities (like light, temperature, or motion) and convert them into electrical signals for processing in a circuit.
   - **Symbol**: Various symbols depending on the type of sensor (e.g., thermistor, photodiode).

### 13. **Connectors and Interconnects**
   - **Function**: Connectors and interconnects provide the physical and electrical connection between different parts of a circuit or between different devices.
   - **Symbol**: ![Connector Symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Connector_symbol.svg/120px-Connector_symbol.svg.png)

### Summary:
These basic building blocks form the foundation of all electronic circuits. Understanding how each component works individually and how they interact with each other is essential for designing, analyzing, and troubleshooting electronic systems. Whether you are dealing with simple circuits or complex integrated systems, these components and principles are at the core of electronics.
