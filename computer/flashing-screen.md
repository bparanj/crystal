A flashing laptop screen that becomes dark periodically can be frustrating. Here's how to approach this issue:

Potential causes:

1. Display driver issues
2. Loose or faulty display cable
3. Backlight problems
4. Power management settings
5. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) issues
6. Malware
7. Overheating

Troubleshooting steps:

1. Update or rollback display drivers:
   - Check Device Manager for driver updates
   - If recently updated, try rolling back to a previous version

2. Check power management settings:
   - Adjust screen dimming and power saving options

3. Run Windows diagnostics:
   - Use built-in troubleshooters for display issues

4. Check for malware:
   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus software

5. Monitor temperature:
   - Use software to check if the laptop is overheating
   - Clean vents and ensure proper ventilation

6. Test external display:
   - Connect to an external monitor to isolate screen vs. GPU issues

7. Update BIOS:
   - Check Lenovo's website for BIOS updates

8. Check display cable:
   - Look for loose connections (may require opening the laptop)

9. Disable adaptive brightness:
   - Turn off automatic brightness adjustment in settings

10. Perform a clean boot:
    - Start Windows with minimal drivers to check for software conflicts

11. Reset display settings:
    - Return display settings to default in Windows

12. Check for physical damage:
    - Inspect the screen and hinges for any visible damage

If these steps don't resolve the issue:

1. Contact Lenovo support:
   - They may have model-specific solutions

2. Consider professional repair:
   - The issue might require hardware replacement (display cable, screen, or GPU)

3. Check warranty status:
   - If under warranty, Lenovo may repair or replace the laptop

A laptop screen that flashes or becomes dark intermittently can be caused by several factors, including software issues, hardware problems, or loose connections. Here are some steps to diagnose and fix this issue:

### 1. Check for Software Issues

#### Update Display Drivers

1. **Update via Device Manager**:
   - Right-click on the **Start** button and select **Device Manager**.
   - Expand the **Display adapters** section.
   - Right-click on your display adapter and select **Update driver**.
   - Choose **Search automatically for updated driver software**.

2. **Download from Manufacturer**:
   - Visit the Lenovo support website.
   - Enter your laptop model and download the latest display drivers.
   - Install the drivers and restart your laptop.

#### Adjust Power Settings

1. **Change Power Plan Settings**:
   - Go to **Control Panel** > **Power Options**.
   - Select your active power plan and click on **Change plan settings**.
   - Click on **Change advanced power settings**.
   - Expand **Display** and set **Turn off display after** to a longer duration or **Never**.
   - Ensure **Adaptive brightness** is turned off.

### 2. Check for Hardware Issues

#### Inspect Connections

1. **Loose Connections**:
   - Turn off the laptop and disconnect it from any power source.
   - If comfortable, open the laptop casing and ensure the display cable is securely connected to the motherboard and the screen.

#### Test with an External Monitor

1. **Connect to External Monitor**:
   - Connect your laptop to an external monitor or TV using an HDMI or VGA cable.
   - If the external display works fine, the issue might be with your laptopâ€™s screen or its connections.

### 3. Adjust Display Settings

#### Refresh Rate

1. **Change Refresh Rate**:
   - Right-click on the desktop and select **Display settings**.
   - Scroll down and click on **Advanced display settings**.
   - Click on **Display adapter properties for Display 1**.
   - Go to the **Monitor** tab and select a different refresh rate from the drop-down menu.

### 4. Perform a System Restore

1. **System Restore**:
   - If the issue started recently, performing a system restore to a previous point where the screen was working fine might help.
   - Go to **Control Panel** > **Recovery** > **Open System Restore**.
   - Follow the prompts to restore your system to a previous state.

### 5. Boot in Safe Mode

1. **Boot into Safe Mode**:
   - Restart your laptop and press **F8** (or the appropriate key for your model) before Windows starts to load.
   - Select **Safe Mode** from the advanced boot options.
   - If the issue does not occur in Safe Mode, it might be caused by a software or driver conflict.

### 6. Hardware Replacement

#### Inverter or Backlight Issues

1. **Inverter/Backlight Replacement**:
   - If the screen flickers due to a failing inverter or backlight, these components may need replacement.
   - This typically requires professional repair unless you are experienced with laptop hardware.

By following these steps, you can identify and potentially resolve the issue causing your Lenovo laptop screen to flash and become dark.
