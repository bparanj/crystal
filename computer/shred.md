Here are some hardware options you could use to build an equivalent to a **WipeOS appliance** from scratch, based on small form-factor PCs:

1. **Intel NUC**: Compact and powerful, it offers good processing power with Intel i7-1165G7, 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD. Itâ€™s ideal for high-performance tasks like running multiple data erasure processes.
   
2. **Fitlet2**: A fanless, industrial-grade mini-PC, ideal for low-power environments with various customization options.

3. **UDOO Bolt**: Combines x86 processing with powerful graphics, great for custom-built appliances needing high computational tasks.

4. **Dell OptiPlex Micro**: A small form-factor desktop PC, known for reliability in business environments, suitable for scalable deployments.

### 1. **Zotac ZBOX Mini PCs**:
   - Compact and fanless options are available, offering sufficient processing power for multi-device data erasure tasks.
   - Supports a wide range of Intel processors.

### 2. **ASUS PN50 Mini PC**:
   - Small form factor with AMD Ryzen processors, good for handling moderate workloads with efficiency and low power consumption.

### 3. **Gigabyte BRIX**:
   - Highly customizable with various Intel and AMD options, offering flexibility in performance and scalability in a small form factor.

### 4. **Compulab Airtop3**:
   - Fanless industrial PC designed for rugged environments, scalable and capable of handling multiple storage devices for data erasure.

These options provide comparable performance and form factor to the WipeOS appliance for building your custom setup.
