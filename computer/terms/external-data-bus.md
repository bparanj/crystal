An external data bus in computer hardware is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers.

1. Definition:
   - A set of parallel wires or connections that carry data signals

2. Function:
   - Transfers data between the CPU, memory, and other hardware components

3. Characteristics:
   - Bidirectional: Can send data in both directions
   - Parallel: Multiple bits transferred simultaneously
   - Width: Measured in bits (e.g., 32-bit, 64-bit)

4. Types:
   - Address bus: Carries memory addresses
   - Data bus: Carries actual data
   - Control bus: Carries control signals

5. Speed:
   - Measured in MHz or GHz
   - Affects overall system performance

6. Examples:
   - PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect)
   - AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port)
   - PCIe (PCI Express)

7. Evolution:
   - Trend towards wider buses and higher speeds
   - Shift from parallel to serial in some modern interfaces (e.g., PCIe)

8. Importance:
   - Affects data transfer rates and system throughput
   - Key factor in overall computer performance

The external data bus (EDB) in computer hardware is a set of physical connections (wires or traces on a circuit board) that carry data between the computer's processing CPU and external devices, such as memory, storage, and peripherals.

1. **Purpose**: The EDB facilitates communication between the CPU and external components. It ensures that data can be transferred in and out of the CPU efficiently.

2. **Width**: The width of the data bus, measured in bits (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit), determines how much data can be transferred simultaneously. A wider bus can carry more data at once, which can improve performance.

3. **Speed**: The speed of the data bus, often measured in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz), affects how quickly data can be transferred. Higher speeds result in faster data transfer rates.

4. **Components**: The EDB connects the CPU to various external components, including:
   - **Memory (RAM)**: For temporary data storage and quick access.
   - **Storage Devices**: Such as hard drives, SSDs, and NVMe drives for long-term data storage.
   - **Input/Output Devices**: Including keyboards, mice, printers, and network interfaces.

5. **Types**: Different types of buses are used for different purposes:
   - **System Bus**: Connects the CPU to the main memory (RAM).
   - **Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Bus**: Connects peripheral devices to the CPU.
   - **Universal Serial Bus (USB)**: Connects external devices like keyboards, mice, and storage devices.

Understanding the external data bus is necessary for comprehending how different parts of a computer system communicate and work together. It plays a role in the overall performance and functionality of the system.
