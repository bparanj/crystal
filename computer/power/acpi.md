ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is a power management and configuration standard for computer hardware. Key points:

1. Purpose: Manages power consumption and hardware configuration

2. Developed by: Intel, Microsoft, Toshiba, HP, Phoenix

3. Functions:
   - Power states management
   - Device configuration
   - Thermal management
   - System wakeup control

4. Power states:
   - Global states (G0-G3)
   - Sleep states (S0-S5)
   - Device states (D0-D3)
   - Processor states (C0-C3)

5. OS interaction: Allows operating system to control hardware power management

6. Hardware discovery: Enables OS to discover and configure hardware components

7. Replaced: Advanced Power Management (APM)

8. Implementation: BIOS, device firmware, operating system

9. Benefits:
   - Improved power efficiency
   - Standardized hardware-software interface
   - Enhanced system control

10. Versions: Evolving standard (current version 6.4 as of 2021)
