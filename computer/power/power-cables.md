To determine which power cable to use with a specific model of Lenovo laptop, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Identify the Laptop Model**:
   - Locate the model number on the bottom of the laptop. Lenovo laptops  have a label or sticker that includes the model number and other relevant details.

2. **Check the Power Requirements**:
   - Look for the power requirements on the label or in the user manual. This information  includes the voltage (V) and amperage (A) required by the laptop.

3. **Match the Power Adapter Specifications**:
   - Ensure that the power adapter you are considering matches the voltage and amperage specifications listed for the laptop. Using an adapter with the incorrect specifications can damage the laptop or result in it not charging properly.

4. **Connector Type**:
   - Verify that the connector type of the power adapter matches the power input port on the laptop. Lenovo uses different types of connectors, such as round barrel connectors and rectangular connectors.

### Tools and Resources

1. **Lenovo Support Website**:
   - Use the Lenovo support website to search for your specific laptop model. The support page for your model will provide detailed information about compatible accessories,  power adapters.

2. **User Manual**:
   - Refer to the user manual that came with the laptop. The manual  includes specifications for the power adapter and other accessories.

3. **Power Adapter Labels**:
   - Examine the label on the power adapter itself. It should list the voltage, amperage, and model number. Ensure this matches the requirements of your laptop.

### Example Matching Process

1. **Identify the Model**:
   - Suppose you have a Lenovo ThinkPad T480. Locate the model number on the bottom of the laptop or in the system information.

2. **Check Power Requirements**:
   - For the ThinkPad T480, the power requirements might be 20V and 3.25A. This information can be found on the laptop label or in the user manual.

3. **Find Compatible Adapter**:
   - Look for a Lenovo power adapter that outputs 20V and 3.25A and has the appropriate connector type for the ThinkPad T480. Lenovo adapters often have the part number printed on them.

### Common Lenovo Adapter Types

1. **Round Barrel Connectors**:
   - Older Lenovo models often use round barrel connectors. Ensure the diameter and pin configuration match your laptop’s input.

2. **Rectangular Connectors**:
   - Newer Lenovo models,  many ThinkPads, use rectangular connectors. These are sometimes referred to as "slim-tip" or "rectangular" connectors.

### Additional Tips

- **Universal Adapters**:
  - Some universal power adapters come with multiple tips. Ensure you select the correct tip and set the voltage and amperage correctly.

- **Purchase from Reliable Sources**:
  - Buy power adapters from reliable sources, preferably directly from Lenovo or authorized retailers, to ensure compatibility and safety.

- **Avoid Underpowering**:
  - Ensure the adapter can supply at least the minimum required amperage. Higher amperage adapters are generally safe as the laptop will only draw what it needs, but lower amperage adapters can cause issues.

By following these steps, you can ensure that you select the correct power cable for your Lenovo laptop model, maintaining the safety and functionality of your device.

To ensure you are using the correct power cable for your Lenovo laptop model, check the following:

1. Voltage and Amperage: Look for the voltage (V) and amperage (A) ratings on your laptop and the power cable. These specifications must match to ensure safe and proper functioning.

2. Connector Shape and Size: Lenovo laptops use various power connectors, such as barrel connectors, USB-C, or slim tips. Make sure the cable has the same connector type as your laptop's charging port.

3. Laptop Model and Power Cable Compatibility: Lenovo provides a support page where you can search for your laptop model and find the compatible power cable. Visit the Lenovo support site, enter your laptop model number, and browse the listed compatible accessories.

4. User Manual: Refer to your laptop's user manual, as it  specifies the power requirements and compatible cable types for your specific model.

5. Original Charger: If you still have the original charger that came with your laptop, use that as a reference to find a matching replacement cable.

It is crucial to use the correct power cable to prevent damage to your laptop and ensure optimal performance. When in doubt, consult Lenovo's support resources or contact their customer support for assistance in identifying the appropriate cable for your specific laptop model.

If you have Lenovo laptops with no label or a faded label, and you don't know the specific model, you can try the following steps to identify the appropriate power cable:

1. Check the charging port: Examine the charging port on the laptop and note its shape and size. Common types include barrel connectors, USB-C ports, and slim tips. This information can help narrow down the possible cable options.

2. Measure the connector: If you have a caliper or measuring tool, measure the dimensions of the charging port, particularly the diameter of the connector. Compare these measurements with the specifications of available Lenovo power cables to find a match.

3. Look up the serial number: Lenovo laptops often have a serial number printed on the bottom of the device or inside the battery compartment. If you can find the serial number, enter it on Lenovo's support site to identify your laptop model and compatible accessories.

4. Boot up the laptop: If the laptop still powers on, you can check the system information to find the model details. Follow these steps:
   - On Windows: Press the Windows key + R, type "msinfo32," and press Enter. The System Information window will display your laptop model.
   - On Linux: Open a terminal and enter "sudo dmidecode -t system" to see the laptop model information.

5. Try compatible cables: If you have power cables from other Lenovo laptops, carefully test them with the unknown model to see if they fit securely and charge the device. However, be cautious and stop immediately if you notice any unusual behavior or if the laptop doesn't charge.

If none of these methods work, it's best to contact Lenovo customer support with as much information as you can gather about the laptop (e.g., approximate age, size, port type) and request assistance in identifying the appropriate power cable. They may be able to help you based on the available information.

If the laptops do not have any hard drives and you need to identify the model to determine the appropriate power adapter, you can use several methods that do not rely on the operating system. Here’s how to identify the laptop model and other relevant information:

### Method 1: Check BIOS/UEFI
1. **Access BIOS/UEFI**:
   - Restart the laptop and enter the BIOS/UEFI settings by pressing the appropriate key during startup. Common keys for Lenovo laptops include `F1`, `F2`, `F10`, `ESC`, or `DEL`.
   - If you see a prompt like "Press [key] to enter Setup" during startup, press that key.

2. **Locate System Information**:
   - In the BIOS/UEFI menu, look for a section labeled "System Information," "Main," or "About." This section  contains details about the laptop,  the model number, serial number, and other specifications.

### Method 2: Physical Inspection of Hardware
1. **Battery Compartment**:
   - Power off the laptop and remove the battery if it is removable. Look inside the battery compartment for labels or stickers that might have the model number and other identifying information.

2. **RAM or Hard Drive Compartments**:
   - Carefully open the RAM or hard drive compartments. Sometimes, manufacturers place additional labels inside these compartments that include the model number and other details.

### Method 3: External Inspection
1. **Chassis Labels**:
   - Examine the exterior of the laptop, particularly the bottom and sides. Manufacturers often place stickers or engravings with the model number, serial number, and other important information on the laptop's casing.

2. **Check Under Removable Panels**:
   - If the laptop has removable panels (for accessing RAM, HDD, or SSD), check under these panels for any additional labels or printed information.

### Method 4: Using Diagnostic Tools (If Available)
1. **Lenovo Vantage Hardware Scan**:
   - If you can temporarily install a hard drive with an operating system or boot from a live USB, you can use Lenovo Vantage to perform a hardware scan. Lenovo Vantage provides detailed information about the laptop’s hardware.
