The CMOS battery provides power for the CMOS to retain the data. How does it still retain the data when the CMOS battery dies and is replaced by a new CMOS battery?

The CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) battery provides power to the CMOS chip, which stores system configuration data such as date and time settings, BIOS settings, and hardware configurations. When the CMOS battery dies, the data stored in the CMOS can be lost because the chip relies on the battery to retain this data while the computer is powered off.

However, hereâ€™s how the data can still be retained when the CMOS battery is replaced:

1. **Default BIOS Settings**:
   - Most modern motherboards are designed to revert to default BIOS settings if the CMOS battery fails. This means that when the battery is replaced, the BIOS will load default settings stored in a non-volatile memory (NVRAM or flash memory) on the motherboard.

2. **Firmware Storage**:
   - Some motherboards store critical settings in non-volatile storage that does not require battery power to retain data. This allows the system to restore certain settings even if the CMOS battery is replaced.

3. **System Reconfiguration**:
   - After replacing the CMOS battery, users typically need to re-enter the BIOS setup to configure system settings such as date and time or any custom hardware configurations. These settings will then be saved and maintained by the new CMOS battery.

### Steps to Replace CMOS Battery:

1. **Turn Off the Computer**:
   - Shut down the computer and disconnect it from the power source.

2. **Open the Computer Case**:
   - Remove the cover of the computer case to access the motherboard.

3. **Locate the CMOS Battery**:
   - Find the small, round, coin-cell battery on the motherboard.

4. **Remove the Old Battery**:
   - Carefully remove the old battery, taking note of its orientation (positive and negative sides).

5. **Insert the New Battery**:
   - Place the new CMOS battery in the same orientation as the old one.

6. **Reassemble and Power On**:
   - Close the computer case, reconnect the power source, and turn on the computer.

7. **Reconfigure BIOS Settings**:
   - Enter the BIOS setup during boot (usually by pressing a key like F2, DEL, or ESC) and reconfigure the settings as needed.
