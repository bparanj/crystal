## Character and Boolean Expressions

Dissect a complex expressions into smaller expressions. We can understand the meaning of an expression by applying it on sample data. Create a table containing the values of all variables and expression parts as each expression part is evaluated. After the loop terminates we can see a picture emerging.

De Morgan's rules provide you a quick and easy way to disentangle a complicated logical expression. Concepts:

- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Short-circuit evaluation 

## Exercises

Find, simplify, and reason about five nontrivial Boolean expressions in the source code base. Do not spend time on understanding what the expression elements mean; concentrate on the conditions that will make the expression become true or false. Where possible, identify and use the properties of short-circuit evaluation.

Locate and reason about five nontrivial integer or character expressions in the source code base. Try to minimize the amount of code you need to comprehend in order to reason about each expression.
