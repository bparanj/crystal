### Architecture

The architecture dictates the modular decomposition of the system's elements.

At the implementation level, elements are decomposed by using mechanisms such as functions, objects, ADTs and components.

Understanding the decomposition of system elements from the perspective of the Rails framework internals and contributors involves looking at how the framework itself is organized and modularized. The Rails codebase is structured to provide a wide range of functionalities to application developers, and this structure is reflected in its internal components:

1. **Active Record**:
   - Handles object-relational mapping (ORM), allowing interaction with the database using Ruby objects.
   - Manages database connections, migrations, and model definitions.

2. **Action View**:
   - Manages view templates and rendering.
   - Includes helpers for HTML generation and other view-related utilities.

3. **Action Controller**:
   - Manages controller logic, including request handling, response rendering, and action processing.
   - Integrates with other components for session management and redirect handling.

4. **Action Mailer**:
   - Provides functionality for email composition and delivery, similar in structure to Action Controller.

5. **Active Support**:
   - A collection of utility classes and Ruby language extensions used by various Rails components.
   - Includes core extensions, time management, internationalization support, and more.

6. **Rails Routing**:
   - Manages URL mappings to controllers and actions.
   - Defines the interface for routing within web applications.

7. **Railties**:
   - The core engine of Rails that glues the various components together.
   - Responsible for tasks like initializing the application and managing Rails commands.

8. **Asset Pipeline**:
   - Manages assets like JavaScript, CSS, and images.
   - Handles asset compilation and minification for production.

9. **Active Job**:
   - An abstraction layer for background job processing.
   - Allows queuing and executing jobs outside of the request-response cycle.

10. **Action Cable**:
    - Manages WebSockets for real-time features in Rails applications.

Contributors to the Rails codebase typically work within these components, enhancing and maintaining the functionalities specific to each module. Understanding the roles and interactions of these components is crucial for contributing effectively to Rails' development and evolution.

- How are the objects organized into hierarchies?
- How is common behavior factored out?
- How is dynamic dispatch techniques used?

Libraries, Components, and Processes

At a higher level of granularity, the code of large systems is often decomposed into libraries of object modules, reusable components, and even separate processes.

Domain-Specific and Custom Languages and Tools

Large coding efforts often involve the creation of specialized tools or benefit from existing ones used in similar endeavors.
