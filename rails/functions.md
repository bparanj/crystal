## Functions

- What are the control flow statements available in Ruby?
- Where is the main code body?
- Identify the major parts of a program. It could be variables and functions.

To understand what a function (or method) is doing you can employ one of the following strategies.

- Guess, based on the function name.
- Read the comment at the beginning of the function. 
- Examine how the function is used.
- Read the code in the function body.
- Consult external program documentation.

When you read code:

- What are the naming conventions for the variables and functions?

Test your initial guess by running appropriate test cases.

This form of gradual understanding is common when reading code; understanding one part of the code can make others fall into place. Based on this form of gradual understanding you can employ a strategy for understanding difficult code similar to the one often used to combine the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle: start with the easy parts.

## Exercises

Examine the visibility of functions and variables in programs in your environment. Can it be improved?

Determine the role of a function. Try to minimize the time spent on each function. Order the strategies by their success rate.
