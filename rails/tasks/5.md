## Frame the Right Question

If the error message is not cryptic and is developer friendly, it is easy to identify the wrong usuage of the Rails API by framing the right question and reading the relevant docs. For example, let's look at this issue:
[Rails 7.1: ActiveRecord polymorphic raise error after add query_constraints #50435](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50435)

## Steps

### Step 1

Run the test case to reproduce the problem.

```ruby
require "bundler/inline"

gemfile(true) do
  source "https://rubygems.org"

  git_source(:github) { |repo| "https://github.com/#{repo}.git" }

  # Activate the gem you are reporting the issue against.
  gem "rails", "~> 7.1.0"
  gem "sqlite3"
  gem "debug"
end

require "active_record"
require "logger"
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: "sqlite3", database: ":memory:")
ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)

ActiveRecord::Schema.define do
  create_table :comments do |t|
    t.bigint :ts, null: false
    t.bigint :nonce, null: false
    t.string :owner_type, null: false
    t.string :owner_id, null: false

    t.timestamps
  end

  create_table :articles do |t|
    t.timestamps
  end
end

class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  query_constraints :ts, :nonce
  belongs_to :owner, polymorphic: true
end

class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :comments, as: :owner
end

article = Article.new
article.save!
article.comments
```

### Step 2 

Read the error message. In this case:

```
The query constraints on the `Comment` model does not include the primary key so Active Record is unable to derive the foreign key constraints for the association. You need to explicitly define the query constraints for this association. (ArgumentError)
```

This error message contains the cause of the failure and how to fix it.

### Step 3

The question now can be stated as:

How to explicitly define the query constraints for this association?

### Step 4

Search online to find the answer to this question. Go to the relevant Rails documentation that explains how to define the query constraints. In this case, this [section](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html) shows an example.

### Step 5

Modify the test case to adapt the example code in the documentation. In this case, the following changes makes it work:

```ruby
class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :owner, polymorphic: true
end

class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :comments, as: :owner, query_constraints: [:ts, :nonce]
end
```

This can be verified by counting the number of Article in the database.

### Step 6

Post your working code on the issue tracker and link to the relevant Rails API documentation.
