## Executable Documentation

Separate PBT testing from documenting the ActiveRecord. This simplifies the task. Goal: To build a tool for Executable Documentation

### Environment Setup

- Install gems
- Run in-memory database
- Create table

### Read the Documentation

Determine the data type for the arguments to the method.

### Select the Dataset

Select the dataset for the edge cases from the predefined table.

```ruby
edge_cases = {
  integer: [0, -1, Integer::MAX, nil],
  string: ["", " ", "a very long string", nil],
  # ... other data types
}
```

Will a custom Generator be useful in this step? Yes, read [Custom Generators](./39.md).

### Execute the Code

For each edge case:

- Run the code
- Capture the result
- Document the behavior (manual)

### Step 1: Environment Setup

- **Install Gems**: You can automate this with a `Gemfile` specifying all the necessary gems, and use Bundler to install them.
- **Run In-memory Database**: SQLite is a good choice for an in-memory database in a Ruby environment. You can configure Rails to use SQLite in memory for this purpose.
- **Create Table**: Automate table creation with ActiveRecord migrations, which can be executed.

### Step 2: Read the Documentation

- **Manual Review**: This involves manually reading your Rails application's code and possibly the Rails API documentation to understand the expected data types for method arguments.
- **Document Insights**: It's important to document your findings, possibly in a structured format like a markdown file or a designated documentation section within your codebase.

### Step 3: Specify the Data Type

- **Custom Annotations**: You can define a custom annotation syntax in your code comments to specify argument data types. This would require a parsing mechanism to read and understand these annotations.
- **Parsing Annotations**: Write a script that parses these annotations from your codebase.

### Step 4: Select the Dataset

Read the annotation and select the dataset for the edge cases from the predefined table for the specific data type.

- **Edge Case Coverage**: Ensure your predefined table covers a comprehensive range of edge cases for each data type.

### Step 5: Execute the Code

- **Automated Execution**: Write a script to automatically run the code for each edge case. This could involve using Ruby's reflection and metaprogramming capabilities.
- **Capture Results**: The script should capture the output or results of each code execution, which might include standard output, error messages, and return values.
- **Document Behavior**: This might still be a manual process where you interpret the results and document the behavior. Consider creating a template or structured format for this documentation to maintain consistency.

### Additional Consideration:

- **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the dataset for edge cases based on real-world usage and new scenarios.
