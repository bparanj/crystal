## Property Based Testing

There is a Ruby equivalent to the Hypothesis library from Python, known as "Rantly". Rantly is a Ruby gem that allows property-based testing, similar to what Hypothesis offers for Python. Property-based testing is a technique where you specify the general properties of the output that a function should produce, and the testing library then generates test cases that try to falsify these properties.

### Features of Rantly:

- **Data Generation**: Like Hypothesis, Rantly can generate structured random data, such as integers, strings, arrays, hashes, etc., based on specifications you provide.
- **Property-based Testing**: It runs your test with many random inputs and checks the properties you expect.
- **Shrinking**: Although not as advanced as Hypothesis's shrinking capability, Rantly attempts to reduce failing test cases to simpler forms to help diagnose issues.

### How to Use Rantly:

1. **Install Rantly**:
   First, add Rantly to your Gemfile:
   ```ruby
   gem 'rantly'
   ```
   Then run `bundle install`.

2. **Write a Test**:
   Here's a basic example of using Rantly in a test (assuming you're using a testing framework like RSpec):
   ```ruby
   require 'rantly'
   require 'rantly/rspec_extensions'

   describe 'my test' do
     it 'should test property' do
       property_of {
         # Generate your test data
         Rantly { int }
       }.check { |i|
         # Your test logic
         expect(i).to be_a(Integer)
       }
     end
   end
   ```

In this test, `Rantly` is used to generate random integers, and the test checks that each generated value is an integer.

### Limitations:

- **Popularity and Support**: Rantly is not as widely known or as actively maintained as Hypothesis in Python.
- **Feature Set**: The feature set of Rantly might not be as extensive as Hypothesis, particularly in areas like test case shrinking.

In summary, while Rantly provides a way to perform property-based testing in Ruby, it may not be as feature-rich as Hypothesis. It's a good starting point for introducing property-based testing concepts into your Ruby tests.
