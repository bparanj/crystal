## My Cousin Vinny

To implement a checkout system with Property-Based Testing (PBT) for the given requirements, we need to identify properties that should consistently hold true. These properties will guide the tests, ensuring that the system correctly handles various pricing schemes and combinations of items. Hereâ€™s a detailed extraction of properties based on the provided requirements:

### Basic Pricing Rules:
- Individual items (A, B, C, D) have specific unit prices.
- Some items have special prices for buying multiple units (e.g., 3 A's for $1.30, 2 B's for $0.45).

### Properties for PBT:

1. **Individual Pricing Consistency**: The cost of a single item matches its specified unit price.
   - Property: Cost of 1 A = $0.50, Cost of 1 B = $0.30, etc.

2. **Special Pricing Application**: When the exact quantity for a special price is met, the special price should apply.
   - Property: Cost of 3 A's = $1.30, Cost of 2 B's = $0.45.

3. **Incremental Addition**: Adding an item to the basket increases the total price by its unit price, unless a special price condition is met.
   - Property: Adding 1 A to basket increases total by $0.50, unless it completes a set of 3 for the special price.

4. **Order Independence**: The total price should be the same regardless of the order in which items are scanned.
   - Property: Scanning A, B, A should cost the same as scanning B, A, A.

5. **Non-negative Total Price**: The total price of the basket should never be negative.
   - Property: Total price >= $0 for any combination of items.

6. **Correct Special Price Boundary**: Special pricing applies at the defined quantity thresholds and reverts to standard pricing for additional units.
   - Property: After 3 A's (special price), the 4th A costs an additional unit price, not special price.

7. **Cumulative Pricing**: The total price is the cumulative cost of all items in the basket, considering both special and individual pricing.
   - Property: Total price = Sum of individual and special prices based on the items and their quantities.

8. **No Overlapping Specials**: Only one special pricing applies at a time for a given set of items.
   - Property: If multiple specials are eligible, the one offering the lowest price for that set applies.

9. **Dynamic Pricing Rule Application**: The system should correctly apply any set of pricing rules passed to it.
   - Property: Total price should reflect the pricing rules provided at the start of the transaction.

10. **Flexibility in Item Addition**: Items can be added to the basket in any order and quantity, and the system should still compute the correct total.
    - Property: System correctly recalculates total price whenever items are added or removed.

### Implementing in PBT:

In a PBT framework, these properties would guide the generation of test cases. You would generate a variety of random baskets containing different combinations and quantities of items, and then verify that the properties hold for each basket. This approach ensures that the checkout system behaves correctly under a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases that might not be immediately obvious:

- **Random Basket Generation**: Create test cases with random combinations of items (A, B, C, D) in varying quantities.
- **Testing Against Properties**: For each generated basket, calculate the total price and verify that it adheres to all the identified properties.
- **Edge Cases**: Ensure that the test cases include edge conditions like a single item, multiples that exactly match special pricing, just over the threshold of special pricing, and large quantities.

By using Property-Based Testing in this manner, you can thoroughly validate the correctness and robustness of the supermarket checkout system, ensuring that it consistently applies pricing rules and special offers as intended, regardless of the complexity of the customer's basket.
