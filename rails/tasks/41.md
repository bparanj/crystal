## Generalize Example Based Tests to PBT

Generalize the following example based tests to property based tests using rantly:

```ruby
class TestPrice < Test::Unit::TestCase

  def price(goods)
    co = CheckOut.new(RULES)
    goods.split(//).each { |item| co.scan(item) }
    co.total
  end

  def test_totals
    assert_equal(  0, price(""))
    assert_equal( 50, price("A"))
    assert_equal( 80, price("AB"))
    assert_equal(115, price("CDBA"))

    assert_equal(100, price("AA"))
    assert_equal(130, price("AAA"))
    assert_equal(180, price("AAAA"))
    assert_equal(230, price("AAAAA"))
    assert_equal(260, price("AAAAAA"))

    assert_equal(160, price("AAAB"))
    assert_equal(175, price("AAABB"))
    assert_equal(190, price("AAABBD"))
    assert_equal(190, price("DABABA"))
  end

  def test_incremental
    co = CheckOut.new(RULES)
    assert_equal(  0, co.total)
    co.scan("A");  assert_equal( 50, co.total)
    co.scan("B");  assert_equal( 80, co.total)
    co.scan("A");  assert_equal(130, co.total)
    co.scan("A");  assert_equal(160, co.total)
    co.scan("B");  assert_equal(175, co.total)
  end
end
```

To generalize the example-based tests to property-based tests using Rantly, we need to define properties that encapsulate the rules and behaviors demonstrated in the example tests. Property-based testing will involve generating random sets of goods and verifying that the total price calculated by `CheckOut` adheres to the expected properties.

### Defining Properties for PBT

1. **Individual Pricing**: The cost of a single item matches its specified unit price.

2. **Special Pricing Application**: When the exact quantity for a special price is met, the special price should apply.

3. **Incremental Addition**: Adding an item to the basket increases the total price by its unit price, unless a special price condition is met.

4. **Order Independence**: The total price should be the same regardless of the order in which items are scanned.

5. **Non-negative Total Price**: The total price of the basket should never be negative.

6. **Correct Special Price Boundary**: Special pricing applies at the defined quantity thresholds and reverts to standard pricing for additional units.

### Property-Based Test Using Rantly

Here's how you could structure the property-based tests using Rantly:

```ruby
require 'rantly'
require 'rantly/property'
require 'rantly/shrinks'
require 'test/unit'

class TestPrice < Test::Unit::TestCase

  def price(goods)
    co = CheckOut.new(RULES)
    goods.split(//).each { |item| co.scan(item) }
    co.total
  end

  def test_price_properties
    Rantly { size(100).each {
      goods = string(:of => /[ABCD]/)
      total = price(goods)

      assert(total >= 0, "Total price should be non-negative")

      # Verify individual and special pricing
      # ...

      # Verify order independence
      shuffled_goods = goods.chars.shuffle.join
      assert_equal(total, price(shuffled_goods), "Total price should be order-independent")
      # Other properties can be tested here
      # For example, checking the incremental addition of items and correct special price application
      # ...
    }}
  end
end
```

### Explanation

- **`string(:of => /[ABCD]/)`**: This generates a random string of items (A, B, C, D) to simulate a basket of goods.

- **`total = price(goods)`**: This calculates the total price of the generated basket of goods using the `price` method.

- **`assert(total >= 0, ...)`**: This asserts that the total price is always non-negative.

- **`shuffled_goods`**: This is a shuffled version of the goods string to test the order independence property.

- **Other Properties**: Within the same `each` block, you can add assertions to test the other properties like individual pricing consistency, special pricing application, and correct special price boundary.

In the context of the provided test code for a checkout system, `RULES` appears to be a constant that defines the pricing rules for different items (A, B, C, D), including their individual unit prices and any special pricing offers. However, the actual definition of `RULES` isn't included in the snippet you provided. Typically, `RULES` would be defined in the same context as the `CheckOut` class, or it could be passed to the `CheckOut` instance when it's created.

Here's an example of how `RULES` might be structured:

```ruby
RULES = {
  'A'

 => { unit_price: 50, special: { quantity: 3, price: 130 } },
  'B' => { unit_price: 30, special: { quantity: 2, price: 45 } },
  'C' => { unit_price: 20 },
  'D' => { unit_price: 15 }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Unit Price**: Each item (A, B, C, D) has a unit price.
- **Special Pricing**: Items A and B have special pricing rules. For example, buying 3 units of A costs $1.30, and 2 units of B costs $0.45.

### Integration with the `CheckOut` Class:

The `CheckOut` class would use these `RULES` to calculate the total price of items as they are scanned. Hereâ€™s a simplified view of how `CheckOut` might be structured:

```ruby
class CheckOut
  def initialize(rules)
    @rules = rules
    @items = Hash.new(0)
  end

  def scan(item)
    @items[item] += 1
  end

  def total
    @items.sum do |item, quantity|
      if @rules[item][:special] && quantity >= @rules[item][:special][:quantity]
        special_price(item, quantity) + standard_price(item, quantity % @rules[item][:special][:quantity])
      else
        standard_price(item, quantity)
      end
    end
  end

  private

  def standard_price(item, quantity)
    @rules[item][:unit_price] * quantity
  end

  def special_price(item, quantity)
    specials = quantity / @rules[item][:special][:quantity]
    specials * @rules[item][:special][:price]
  end
end
```

In this `CheckOut` class:

- The `initialize` method sets up the pricing rules and a hash to track scanned items.
- The `scan` method adds items to the basket.
- The `total` method calculates the total price by applying special pricing (if applicable) and then adding the standard price for any remaining items.

This is a basic example. Depending on the complexity of the pricing rules, the calculation logic in `total` could be more sophisticated. For example, it might need to handle overlapping special deals, different types of specials (like "buy two, get one free"), and so on.

### Conclusion

Property-based testing with Rantly allows you to test a wide range of scenarios by generating random inputs and verifying that the properties hold true for each. This approach can help uncover edge cases and ensure that the checkout system behaves correctly under various conditions.
