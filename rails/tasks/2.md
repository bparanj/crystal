## Improve Documentation

Read the blog posts https://rubyonrails.org/2023/10/5/Rails-7-1-0-has-been-released

Add missing documentation for new features. In this case Docker related information was missing in getting started guide. I modified and added information from a related PR on Docker command issue: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50402

New section added:

Dockerfile
-----------

Rails will generate all the Dockerfiles you need to deploy your application using
Kamal, or any other Docker-based deployment setup, when you run rails new. These 
Dockerfiles are tuned for production use with proper caching layers, multi-stage building
to minimize image sizes, and all the dependencies needed whether you use a JavaScript 
build environment or not. You can use Docker to run your application by running the 
following commands:

```bash
$ cat config/master.key
very-secret-master-key
$  docker run -p 3000:3000 -e RAILS_MASTER_KEY="very-secret-master-key" -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://xxx:@host.docker.internal/rails_50402_development rails-50402
```

This command runs a Docker container from the `rails-50402` image. It maps port 3000
of the container to port 3000 on the host machine, ensuring the application inside the
container is accessible through port 3000 on the host. The `-e` flag sets environment 
variables: `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` is assigned a specific key value that is unique to your 
application. The `DATABASE_URL` is points to a PostgreSQL database, with the hostname
`host.docker.internal` indicating a database running on the host machine. This setup is
typically used for running and testing a Rails application in an isolated environment.
