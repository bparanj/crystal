## Define Interface

Creating clear interfaces in a Rails application involves designing parts of your system in such a way that they communicate with each other through well-defined and consistent methods or APIs. This approach reduces coupling between different parts of your application, making it easier to maintain and refactor.

### Example: User Authentication

Let's consider a simple example of user authentication in a Rails application. Instead of scattering authentication logic throughout controllers and models, you can create a dedicated service or module for it.

#### Step 1: Define an Authentication Service

Create a service (`AuthService`) to handle authentication-related logic.

```ruby
# app/services/auth_service.rb
class AuthService
  def self.authenticate(email, password)
    user = User.find_by(email: email)
    return user if user && user.authenticate(password)

    nil
  end
end
```

In this service, `authenticate` is a clear interface for checking a user's credentials. The `User` model would have its own authentication method (like using `has_secure_password`).

#### Step 2: Use the Interface in Controllers

Instead of duplicating authentication logic in controllers, use the `AuthService`.

```ruby
# app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    user = AuthService.authenticate(params[:email], params[:password])
    if user
      # Handle successful authentication
      session[:user_id] = user.id
      redirect_to root_path, notice: 'Logged in successfully'
    else
      # Handle failed authentication
      flash.now[:alert] = 'Invalid email or password'
      render :new
    end
  end
end
```

#### Benefits

- **Reduced Coupling**: The controller doesn't need to know the details of how users are authenticated. If the authentication process changes, you only need to update `AuthService`.
- **Reusability**: The same `AuthService` can be used across different parts of the application (e.g., API controllers, background jobs).
- **Easier Testing**: You can test the authentication logic independently of the controllers or models.
- **Clarity**: Other developers working on the code can quickly understand that `AuthService.authenticate` is the go-to method for user authentication.

### Conclusion

Clear interfaces in Rails, as demonstrated with `AuthService`, help to encapsulate functionality and reduce direct dependencies between different parts of the application. This makes your application more modular, easier to test, and adaptable to changes.
