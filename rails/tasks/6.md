## Isolate the Problem

Projects use other gem like RSpec. In order to isolate the problem we need to use an appropriate bug report template. The templates can be found [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/guides/bug_report_templates).

## Steps

### Step 1

Read the issue. For example: [API only, multi DB. Undefined method `id' for {}:Hash #50398](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50398)

### Step 2

Read the stack trace. In this case it is mixed with Rails and RSpec. We don't the root cause of the problem. Just by looking at the issue, it seems like a Routing issue. However other commenter has run into a similar problem that was caused by Webmock.

### Step 3

Identify the relevant [bug templates from](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/guides/bug_report_templates) for the issue.

### Step 4

Post your comments on the issue tracker:

In order to isolate the problem to either Rails or RSpec. Please create a reproducible test case using this template:

https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/action_controller.rb

if this is not applicable, use the genertic template:

https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/generic.rb
