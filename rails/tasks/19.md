## Reproduce using Docker

Creating a Docker image with Ruby 3.0.0 installed involves writing a `Dockerfile` and building an image from it. Here's a step-by-step guide to do this on Ubuntu 22.04.

### 1. Create a Dockerfile

First, you need to create a `Dockerfile`. This file contains instructions for building the Docker image.

1. **Open a Terminal**:
   - Open your terminal on Ubuntu.

2. **Create a Directory for Dockerfile**:
   - It's good practice to create a new directory for your Docker project.
     ```bash
     mkdir ruby-docker
     cd ruby-docker
     ```

3. **Create a Dockerfile**:
   - Create a `Dockerfile` using a text editor like `nano`.
     ```bash
     nano Dockerfile
     ```

4. **Write the Dockerfile**:
   - In the editor, write the following content:
	 	 
     ```Dockerfile
		 # Use an official Ruby runtime as a parent image
		 FROM ruby:3.0.0
		 
		 RUN gem install bundler

		 # Install SQLite3
		 RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev

		 # Install Rails 7.0
		 RUN gem install rails -v 7.0.0

		 # Set the working directory in the container
		 WORKDIR /usr/src/app

		 # Copy the script into the container at /usr/src/app
		 COPY . .

		 # Run the script when the container launches
		 CMD ["ruby", "your_script_name.rb"]
     ```
   - This `Dockerfile` starts from the official Ruby 3.0.0 image, sets up a working directory, copies the current directory's contents into the container, installs any dependencies, exposes port 80, and sets the default command to run an app.

Replace `your_script_name.rb` with the name of your Ruby script file.

5. **Save and Exit**:
   - Save and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `Ctrl` + `X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to save).

### 2. Prepare Your Script

1. **Create Your Ruby Script File**:
   - Ensure that your script (the one you provided in the question) is saved in a file, e.g., `your_script_name.rb`, and is in the same directory as your Dockerfile.

### 3. Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image with the updated Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t ruby-activerecord-test .
```

### 4. Run the Docker Container

Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name my-ruby-test ruby-activerecord-test
```

This will execute your Ruby script inside the Docker container.

In the command `docker run -it --rm --name my-ruby-test ruby-activerecord-test`, `my-ruby-test` is the name you are assigning to the container instance that is being created and run from the Docker image `ruby-activerecord-test`. Let's break down the command to understand it better:

1. **`docker run`**: This is the command to create and start a Docker container.

2. **`-it`**: These are two flags combined:
   - `-i` (`--interactive`): Keeps the standard input (STDIN) open even if not attached.
   - `-t` (`--tty`): Allocates a pseudo-TTY, which simulates a terminal, like your command line or terminal window.

3. **`--rm`**: This flag automatically removes the container when it exits. It helps to clean up and not leave behind any stopped containers.

4. **`--name my-ruby-test`**:
   - `--name` specifies the name you want to give to your container.
   - `my-ruby-test` is the name you've chosen. You can use this name to refer to the container when using various Docker commands (like `docker stop my-ruby-test`).

5. **`ruby-activerecord-test`**: This is the name of the Docker image from which the container is being created. It should match the tag name you used when you built the image with `docker build -t ruby-activerecord-test .`.

So, in simple terms, this command says: "Run a new container interactively from the `ruby-activerecord-test` image, name this container `my-ruby-test`, and remove the container when it's stopped."

### Additional Notes:

- The Dockerfile is tailored to run a standalone Ruby script, not a full Rails application.
- The `sqlite3` and `libsqlite3-dev` packages are installed since your script uses SQLite.
- The `CMD` command in the Dockerfile specifies that the Ruby script should be run when the container starts.
- Make sure the script is in the same directory as the Dockerfile before building the Docker image.
- This setup assumes the primary goal is to test the ActiveRecord associations as defined in your script.
