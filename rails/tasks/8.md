## Finding Relevant Test

How to identify the relevant test to make modification to an existing behavior? This is an enhancement to an existing feature.

[Add BACKTRACE env variable to turn off backtrace for normal running, not just tests](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50440)

To find any related existing tests for this functionality, raise an exception in the line before your implementation begins. If any test fails due to your exception then you already have a test. That existing test can be modified to express the new requirement. It should fail. If not, write a failing test for the new behavior. Any test that you write must follow the existing conventions of the Rails codebase. Ideally, for one line change you only want one or two lines of tests.

Implement your current approach and make it pass. The test should be for both on and off scenarios.
