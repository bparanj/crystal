## Regression Bugs

If a test case is given and you are able to reproduce the problem, downgrade Rails version and see if the problem disappears. This is a very useful skill for working on any language.

At work, this helped me to track down a rspec regression bug. It took me a week eventually to apply this technique. Now I routinely test for regression bugs.

## Steps

### Step 1 : Run the Test Case

Copy the test case and verify that it fails as in the report. For example, [config.after_routes_loaded defined on config/application.rb never called](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50720).

### Step 2 : Modify the Test Case

Change the Rails version to the next lower version, in this case, I went from Rails 7.1.2 to 7.0.0.

### Step 3 : Report your Findings

In this specific example, the test case was using Ruby version that is still not officially supported. My test confirmed that this problem still exists in the officially supported highest version of Ruby. It was also running against the edge Rails and Rails 7.1.2.

Ran into unrelated error when testing to see if the problem disappears in Rails 7.0.0. Posted the results with the corresponding test and Dockerfile.

Someone might recognize any errors I made and could help me to test it on Rails 7.

I also learned that if you have repeating gem install for the same gem, you will get an cryptic error:

```
 `basename': no implicit conversion of nil into String (TypeError)

            if File.basename(@gemfile) == Injector::INJECTED_GEMS
                             ^^^^^^^^
```

Ideally the bundler must recognize the cause of the error and provide a clear message indicating the cause and how to fix the error.

Searching the bundler github issues, I did not see any open issue for : no implicit conversion of nil into String

You can create a new issue by replicating this with a small test case and report it.
