## Git Basics for Contributors

By mistake I created a branch from another branch that had unrelated changes. To remove the unrelated commits from the PR, use git amend.

## Rebase

To remove one of the two commits from the `document-edge-cases-for-find` branch, use interactive rebase:

1. Open your terminal and switch to the branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout document-edge-cases-for-find
   ```

2. Start an interactive rebase for the last two commits:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~2
   ```

3. In the text editor that opens, you'll see a list of the last two commits. To remove one, change `pick` to `drop` next to the commit you want to delete. Save and close the editor.

4. Finally, force push the changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin document-edge-cases-for-find --force
   ```

Be cautious with force pushing as it alters the branch's history.

## Amend

To amend a commit with Git:

1. Make the changes you need in your code.
2. Stage the changes for commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
3. Amend the previous commit:
   ```bash
   git commit --amend
   ```
4. If you don't want to change the commit message, save and close the editor that opens.
5. If you've already pushed the original commit to a remote repository, force push the amended commit:
   ```bash
   git push origin [your-branch-name] --force
   ```

Use caution with `--force` as it overwrites history on the remote branch.

## RVM

To use a specific RVM gemset by default for a Rails project:

1. Navigate to your Rails project directory.
2. Create an RVM configuration file by running:
   ```
   rvm --ruby-version use [ruby-version]@[gemset-name]
   ```
   Replace `[ruby-version]` with your Ruby version and `[gemset-name]` with your gemset name.
3. This creates two files: `.ruby-version` and `.ruby-gemset` in your project directory.
4. The `.ruby-version` file sets the Ruby version, and `.ruby-gemset` sets the gemset.
5. Now, whenever you navigate to this project directory, RVM will automatically switch to this Ruby version and gemset.

This ensures the specified gemset is used every time you work on this project.

```
rvm --ruby-version use 3.3.0@dox
```
