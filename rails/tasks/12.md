Setup gitpod
Install extension for github
Trigger a new workspace to install newer version of Ruby:

https://gitpod.io/#imagebuild/https://github.com/bparanj/rails-docs

This does not work. Codespace also does not work with latest version of Ruby because the Docker images are behind in Ruby version.
