## Cloud Development Environment

### Gitpod

- Setup gitpod
- Install extension for github
- Trigger a new workspace to install newer version of Ruby:

https://gitpod.io/#imagebuild/https://github.com/bparanj/rails-docs

This does not work. 

### Codespace

Codespace also does not work with latest version of Ruby because the Docker images are behind in Ruby version.

### VS Code + EC2

VS code hangs up after working for sometime with EC2. 

### Cloud9 IDE

Still testing. Updates to come later.

### Current Setup

EC2 t2 micro instance with Docker installed to switch between different versions of Ruby and Rails to test for regression bugs quickly.

Docker images are huge and fills up the disk space after few weeks of work. Need to delete old Docker images to free up disk space.
