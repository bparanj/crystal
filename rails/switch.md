## Switch Statements

When examining code, look out for common errors in switch-case and other control structures.

Examine the handling of unexpected values in switch statements in the programs you read. Propose changes to detect errors. Discuss how these changes will affect the robustness of programs in a production environment.

Is there a tool or a compiler option in your environment for detecting missing break statements in switch code? Use it, and examine the results on some sample programs.
