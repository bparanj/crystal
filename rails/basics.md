## Code Analysis

When reading code ask yourself:

- Why is this written this way?
- What in the author's background would lead him to this choice?

This mode is reviewing code for problems. You are looking for patterns and clues. Use incongruities you find to double check your understanding.

- Do you see any bugs or dubious coding practices?

Fixing bug in a big codebase:

- How do you start?
- How can you assess the impact of a change you are thinking of making?
- What methods do you use to identify or understand what you are observing?

You're asking about the process or techniques used to recognize or interpret code.
