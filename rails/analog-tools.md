## Analog Tools

Print on paper code you find hard to understand. A typical computer screen consists of about a million dots; a page from a laser printer can contain more than 30 million dots. This difference results in more information per page and less eyestrain. More importantly, you can take the printout to places where you can concentrate better than at your desk, and you can easily highlight code, draw lines, and write side notes. Use highlighters, colored pens, Post-it notes, and anything else that will help you annotate the code to make it understandable.

Draw diagrams to depict the code's operation. As the printout has allowed you to move away from your screen, you can now take out a piece of paper and draw diagrams for the parts you want to understand. Do not strive for perfect or even correct diagrams; anything goes as long as it helps you focus on the code you are reading. Some things you can draw include the following:

- Functions in little boxes with arrows to indicate function calls or flow of data
- Class hierarchies or diagrams of concrete object instances with properly filled-in properties
- Data structures (trees, lists, and so on) using arrows to indicate pointers
- Bit fields and corresponding masks in bit-mapped registers
- State transition diagrams using circles to indicate states and arrows to indicate state transitions
- Strings or arrays and corresponding indices or pointers
- Entity-relationship diagrams to understand how parts of a larger system fit together

Use a pencil when drawing and be prepared to revise your diagram as you gradually comprehend the program's operation.

You can always get a better understanding of a piece of code by explaining it to someone else. The act of articulating the program's operations to make them understandable to a third person forces you to think at a different pace and can bring forward details you may have glossed over. In addition, to properly explain the program you may need to draw on supplementary material such as books, diagrams, and printouts that you may have been too lazy to use when attempting to understand it on your own.

To understand complicated algorithms or subtle data structures, select a peaceful and quiet environment and concentrate deeply without drawing any help from computerized or mechanical aids. Dijkstra detailed in a lecture how people asked to reason about the derivation of a particular synchronization algorithm would invariably become confused the moment they grabbed a pencil or pen.

Interruptions can be similarly distractive. Psychologists use the term flow to describe the condition of deep, nearly meditative involvement with a particular task, a condition often associated with an euphoric state of mind and obliviousness to the passage of time. This is the state you want to be in when examining complicated code. Unfortunately, you may need as many as 15 minutes to reach that state, and any interruption (telephone ring, arrival of new e-mail, a colleague asking for help) will bring you back to square one. Therefore, create an environment and work habits that let you work without interruptions when needed.

## Exercise 1

Print out a copy of the ActiveRecord and explain the operation of the find function to a
friend. For extra credit explain it to a nonprogrammer, a pet and a bonsai tree.

## Exercise 2

Repeat the exercise above after drawing appropriate diagrams.

## Exercise 3

Measure the time intervals that pass without interruptions in your work environment. Calculate the resulting hours of flow and compare them to the total time you spend at work.
