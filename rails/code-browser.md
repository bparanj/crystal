## Code Browsers and Beautifiers

A number of tools are explicitly designed to support source code browsing. Typical facilities provided by browsers include the display of the following.

Definitions: Locate where an entity is defined.
References: Go through all places where an entity is used.
A call graph: List the functions called by a given function.
A caller graph: List the functions calling a given function.
A file outline: List the functions, variables, types, and macros defined in a file.

In a Ruby project, accomplishing tasks like locating definitions, finding references, generating call and caller graphs, and creating file outlines can be achieved using a combination of IDE features, static analysis tools, and custom scripting. Here's how you can approach each task:

1. **Definitions (Locate where an entity is defined)**:
   - **IDE Feature**: Use the "Go to Definition" or "Navigate to Declaration" feature in IDEs like RubyMine or Visual Studio Code with Ruby extensions.
   - **Text Search**: Use `grep` or similar tools to search for the entity across your project files.

2. **References (Go through all places where an entity is used)**:
   - **IDE Feature**: Use the "Find Usages" or "Find References" feature in your IDE.
   - **Static Analysis Tools**: Tools like RuboCop can sometimes help identify where certain methods or classes are used.
   - **Text Search**: Use `grep` or similar tools to search for references to the entity in the codebase.

3. **A Call Graph (List the functions called by a given function)**:
   - **Custom Scripting**: Write a Ruby script that parses the code and tracks method calls within a given method.
   - **Dynamic Analysis Tools**: Use runtime profiling tools like `ruby-prof` to trace method calls during execution.

4. **A Caller Graph (List the functions calling a given function)**:
   - **IDE Feature**: Some IDEs may provide a feature to explore the callers of a method.
   - **Custom Scripting/Analysis**: Similar to generating a call graph, but tracking which methods call a specific function instead.

5. **A File Outline (List the functions, variables, types, and macros defined in a file)**:
   - **IDE Feature**: Most IDEs provide a file structure or outline view that lists methods, classes, and modules defined in a file.
   - **Static Analysis Tools**: Use tools like Ripper (Ruby's standard library parser) to analyze the file and extract the required information.
   - **Custom Scripting**: Write a script using Ruby's introspection features or parser libraries to extract and list the definitions.

These methods leverage the features of development tools and the dynamic nature of Ruby. While some tasks might require custom solutions, particularly for generating call and caller graphs, Ruby's reflective capabilities and the rich ecosystem of development tools provide various ways to achieve these code analysis goals.

## Class Name

Given a class name you can obtain:

- Where the class is defined
- The locations where the class is referenced
- The classes derived from this class
- The base classes for this class
- Its public, protected, and private methods and fields

In a Ruby project, obtaining detailed information about a class, such as its definition location, references, inheritance hierarchy, and methods, can be achieved through a mix of IDE features, static analysis tools, and Ruby's introspection capabilities. Here's how to accomplish each task:

1. **Where the Class is Defined**:
   - **IDE Feature**: Use "Go to Definition" or "Navigate to Declaration" in IDEs like RubyMine or Visual Studio Code with Ruby extensions.
   - **Text Search**: Use `grep` or similar tools in the command line to find the class definition in your project files.

2. **Locations Where the Class is Referenced**:
   - **IDE Feature**: Use "Find Usages" or "Find References" in your IDE.
   - **Static Analysis Tools**: Tools like RuboCop can sometimes help identify where certain classes are used.
   - **Text Search**: Use `grep` or similar tools for a textual search across your project.

3. **Classes Derived from This Class**:
   - **Custom Scripting**: Iterate over all loaded classes (using `ObjectSpace.each_object(Class)`) and check if they inherit from the target class.
   - **IDE/Editor**: Some IDEs or advanced editors might offer features to explore class hierarchies.

4. **The Base Classes for This Class**:
   - **Introspection**: Use the `.ancestors` method on the class to get its ancestor chain and identify base classes.
   - **IDE/Editor**: Some IDEs provide features to inspect class inheritance.

5. **Public, Protected, and Private Methods and Fields**:
   - **Introspection**: Use Ruby's reflection methods like `.public_methods`, `.protected_methods`, `.private_methods`, `.instance_variables`, etc., on the class or an instance of the class.
   - **IDE/Editor**: Most IDEs provide an outline view showing the methods and fields, often with indicators for their visibility (public, protected, private).

For example, to find the methods of a class `MyClass`, you can use:
```ruby
puts MyClass.public_methods(false)    # List public methods
puts MyClass.protected_methods(false) # List protected methods
puts MyClass.private_methods(false)   # List private methods
```

These methods leverage Ruby's dynamic and reflective nature, making it possible to gather extensive information about classes. While custom scripting offers the most flexibility, IDEs simplify many of these tasks with built-in features.
