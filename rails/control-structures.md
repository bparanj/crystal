## Control Structures

We have examined the syntactic details of the control flow statements. We now focus on the way we can reason about them at an abstract level.

Examine one control structure at a time, treat its contents as a black box. The control structures allow you to abstract and selectively reason about parts of a program, without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the program.

When examining a program's flow of control: treat the controlling expression of each control structure as an assertion for the code it encloses. 

When reading the loop code, ensure that the code will perform according to its specification under all circumstances. Variants and invariants are useful abstraction for reasoning about properties of loops.

A loop invariant is an assertion about the program state that is valid both at the beginning and at the end of a loop. By demonstrating that a particular loop maintains the invariant, and by choosing an invariant so that when the loop terminates it can be used to indicate that the desired result has been obtained, we can ensure that an algorithm's loop will work within the envelope of the correct algorithm results. 

Establishing this fact is not enough. We also need to ensure that the loop will terminate. For this we use a variant, a measure indicating our distance from our final goal, which should be decreasing at every loop iteration. If we can demonstrate that a loop's operation decreases the variant while maintaining the invariant, we determine that the loop will terminate with the correct result.

- How to find the invariant and variant for a loop?

Finding the invariant and variant of a loop involves identifying the conditions that remain constant throughout the loop's execution (invariant) and those that change (variant). Here's how to do it:

1. **Understand the Loop**: First, thoroughly understand what the loop does. Look at the loop condition, the variables involved, and the operations performed within the loop.

2. **Identify the Invariant**: 
   - The invariant is a condition or set of conditions that must remain true before and after each iteration of the loop for it to function correctly.
   - It often relates to the correctness of the loop. 
   - Example: In a sorting algorithm, an invariant might be that a portion of the list is sorted at each step.

3. **Identify the Variant**: 
   - The variant, or loop variant, is a property that changes with each iteration of the loop and is usually used to ensure the loop's termination.
   - It's often a variable that moves towards meeting the loop termination condition.
   - Example: In a simple for-loop `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`, the variant is `i` as it changes in each iteration and eventually meets the condition `i < n` to terminate the loop.

4. **Analyze the Code**: Look at the loopâ€™s body to see what stays constant (invariant) and what leads towards termination (variant).

5. **Testing**: You can test your identified invariants by adding assertions within the loop to ensure they hold true in every iteration.

The key to finding invariants and variants is understanding of the loop's purpose and how its control flow works. These concepts are crucial in loop design and analysis, especially in complex algorithms.

The invariant is established after the first assignment, so it holds at the beginning of the loop. As it executes code, it might violate the invariant temporarily. Invariant must be reestablished after executing some code. We must show the invariant will also be true when the loop terminates. 

- When will the loop terminate? What is the condition?

If we can show that the invariant when loop terminates can rewritten in the form of the original specification we wanted to satisfy, we demonstrate that the loop arrives at the desired result.

## Exercises

Locate five control structures spanning more than 50 lines of code. Document their body with a single-line comment indicating its function.

Reason about the body of one of the above control structures, indicating the places where you use the controlling expression as an assertion.

Use coding style guidelines to disentangle badly written code while reading it.

- What tools can be used to detect memory leaks in Ruby?

Detecting memory leaks in Ruby can be challenging, but there are several tools and gems that can help identify and manage memory issues:

1. **Ruby's ObjectSpace Module**: Comes with Ruby and can be used to track object allocations and identify potential leaks.

2. **Valgrind**: A popular tool for detecting memory leaks and memory management problems in C-based languages, which can be useful especially when dealing with Ruby extensions written in C.

3. **RB-Spy**: While primarily a profiler, RB-Spy can help identify memory bloat by monitoring which parts of your Ruby program are using the most memory.

4. **Memory Profiler**: A Ruby gem that provides a detailed report of memory allocation by gem, file, and even line of code. 

5. **GC.stat**: This method provides information about Ruby's Garbage Collector, which can be useful for diagnosing memory usage and potential leaks.

6. **LeakChecker**: A part of the Google-perftools suite, LeakChecker can be used to track down memory leaks in Ruby.

Each tool has its strengths and is suited for different types of memory leak detection and analysis. It's often beneficial to use a combination of these tools to comprehensively track down and address memory issues in Ruby applications.

## Exercises

Select a learge software system, locate where arrays are used and categorize their uses. Describe three instances where alternative, more appropriate data structures would have been appropriate. 

Fixed-length arrays notoriously impose arbitrary limits to a program's operation. Locate 10 instances of such limits in existing code and check whether these are documented in the respective system's documentation.

Buffer overflow, a common issue in lower-level languages like C, is much less likely in Ruby due to its high-level nature and built-in memory management. In Ruby, memory allocation and size management for data structures (like arrays and strings) are handled automatically, reducing the risk of buffer overflows, which typically occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold.

However, buffer overflow can still be a concern in Ruby in certain situations:

1. **Ruby Extensions in C**: If you're using or writing Ruby extensions in C, buffer overflow can occur within these extensions. C does not have the same automatic memory management as Ruby, so improper handling of memory allocation and buffer sizes in C code can lead to buffer overflows.

2. **Interacting with External Libraries**: When Ruby interacts with external libraries, especially those written in lower-level languages, there's a potential risk if those libraries are vulnerable to buffer overflow.

3. **Host Environment Vulnerabilities**: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the underlying system or environment where Ruby is running can potentially affect Ruby applications.

While Ruby itself provides a level of protection against buffer overflows, it's crucial to be aware of these scenarios, especially when dealing with external libraries or extensions. Proper validation, error handling, and use of secure coding practices are essential to mitigate these risks.

Locate instances where functions susceptible to a buffer overflow problem are called, and either construct an argument to show that such a problem cannot occur or provide an example of the circumstances that can result in a buffer overflow.

Look for the word queue in the source code documentation and try to identify the corresponding data structure. Locate at least two cases where a corresponding queue data structure is not used and justify the discrepancy.
