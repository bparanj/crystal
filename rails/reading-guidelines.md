## Code Reading Guidelines

Ability to recognize bad code is a valuable skill. Bad code has:

- An inconsistent coding style
- A gratuitously complicated or unreadable structure 
- Obvious logical errors or omissions
- Overuse of nonportable constructs
- Lack of maintenance

Read code selectively and with a goal in your mind. Are you trying to learn new patterns, a coding style, a way to satisfy some requirements?

Notice the nonfunctional requirements that gives rise to a specific implementation style.

### Step 1

Start with small programs. Build the programs you study and run them. This will provide you with immediate feedback on the way the code is supposed to work and a sense of achievement.

### Step 2

Actively change the code to test your understanding. Begin with small changes and gradually increase their scope. Your active involvement with real code can quickly teach you the basics of the new environment.

Read related books, documentation, or manual pages, or attend training courses; the two methods of learning complement each other.

Another way to actively read existing code is to improve it. Think about how you can improve it. This can involve using a better design or algorithm, documenting some code parts, or adding functionality. Document your understanding of the code in improved documentation.
