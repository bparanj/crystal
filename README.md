Clarifications for 9.md:

Yes, when an LED turns on in a circuit with a resistor, it is an example of forward bias. In forward bias, the positive side of the power supply is connected to the anode of the LED, and the negative side is connected to the cathode. This allows current to flow through the LED, causing it to emit light. The resistor is there to limit the current and protect the LED from excessive current flow.

Yes, when the LED turns on in a circuit with a resistor, it demonstrates forward voltage. Forward voltage is the voltage required for the LED to conduct current and emit light. When the LED is forward-biased and the voltage across it reaches a certain threshold (the forward voltage), it allows current to flow and the LED lights up. So, the LED turning on is indeed an example of forward voltage at work.
