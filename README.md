## Relay

An electromagnetic armature relay is a type of relay that uses an electromagnet to mechanically operate a switch. When an electric current flows through the relay's coil, it creates a magnetic field that attracts a movable armature. This movement either opens or closes electrical contacts, allowing or interrupting the flow of current in a circuit.

These relays are commonly used in various applications, such as controlling high-power circuits with low-power signals, providing over-current protection, and managing voltage regulation.

Relay's Purpose: A relay is used to turn on or off a separate electrical circuit.

Voltage/Current Control: Relays often use a low voltage or current to control a higher voltage or current.

Signal Transmission: A small switch can initiate the low voltage/current signal, which is then sent to the relay.

Wire Efficiency: This signal can be transmitted using small, inexpensive wires.

Relay’s Action: The relay, located near the load (the component that requires power), then manages the larger current.

Example: In a car, when you turn the ignition switch, it sends a signal to a relay near the starter motor, which then activates the starter motor.

Basically, it’s about using a small control signal to manage a larger power load efficiently.

## Notes

A resistor is used for limiting the charging rate of a capacitor; providing appropriate control voltage to semiconductors such as bipolar transistors; protecting LEDs or other semiconductors from excessive current; adjusting or limiting the frequency response in an audio circuit (in conjunction with other components); pulling up or pulling down the voltage at the input pin of a digital logic chip; or controlling a voltage at a point in a circuit. In this last application, two resistors can be placed in series to create a voltage divider.

In the process of impeding the flow of current and reducing voltage, a resistor absorbs electrical energy, which it must dissipate as heat. The heat dissipation is typically a fraction of a watt.

Power, measured in watts (W), is indeed the product of voltage (V) and current (I):

P = V x I

This relationship defines how much electrical energy is being converted into another form per unit of time.

Not all of this energy conversion results in heat; the actual dissipation depends on the specific components and their efficiency. For resistors, they dissipate electrical energy primarily as heat due to their resistance. Therefore, while a fraction of the total energy becomes heat, the calculation

P = V x I

 still holds for measuring total electrical power.

## Resistor and Capacitor

Limiting the charging rate of a capacitor with a resistor helps control the rate at which the capacitor charges, preventing too rapid an inflow of current. This control is crucial to avoid potential damage to the capacitor and other circuit components.

When a capacitor charges too quickly, the initial surge of current can be very high, potentially exceeding the safe limits of the capacitor and causing overheating or other forms of damage. The resistor ensures that the charging happens gradually and within safe limits.

It’s about protecting your components and ensuring a stable and controlled charging process.

## Coulomb and faraday

A Coulomb is a unit of electric charge, while a Faraday is a unit of electric charge related to the amount of charge carried by one mole of electrons.

One Faraday equals the charge of approximately 6.022 x 10²³ electrons, or about 96,485 Coulombs. This is rooted in Avogadro's number, which quantifies the number of entities (atoms, molecules, electrons) in one mole. So, while Coulombs and Faradays aren't identical, they are related units in the realm of electric charge.

A Coulomb measures the amount of electric charge, while a Faraday is a specific quantity of that charge based on Avogadro's number. They're different units, but both are in the same "currency" of electric charge. Just like cents and dollars, one is a base unit (Coulomb), and the other is a larger, specific quantity (Faraday).
