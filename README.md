Potentiometer

It can deliver a variable voltage. It is used to adjust sensitivity, balance, input or output. Audio equipment and sensors such as motion detectors use potentiometers.

What does potentio in potentiometer mean

The "potentio" in "potentiometer" comes from the Latin word "potentia," which means power or potential. A potentiometer measures the potential (voltage) difference, allowing you to control the voltage in a circuit by adjusting its resistance

A capacitor connected across a DC power source
will accumulate a charge. This charge then persists after
the source is disconnected. The capacitor stores and can then discharge energy like a small rechargeable battery. The charge
discharge rate is extremely fast but can be limited
by a series resistor, which enables the capacitor
to be used as a timing component in many electronic
circuits.

A capacitor can also be used to block DC current
while it passes pulses, or electrical “noise,” or alternating
current, or audio signals, or other wave
forms. This capability enables it to smooth the
output voltage provided by power supplies; to
remove spikes from signals that would otherwise
tend to cause spurious triggering of components
in digital circuits; to adjust the frequency response
of an audio circuit; or to couple separate
components or circuit elements that must be
protected from transmission of DC current.

The electrical storage capacity of a capacitor is measured in farads. Farad is represented by the letter F. A capacitor that can be charged with a potential difference between its plates of 1 volt, in a time of 1 second, during which it draws 1 amp of current, has a capacitance of 1 farad.

The Time Constant

When a capacitor is charged in series through a resistor. RC circuit. It begins with no charge on its plates, the time constant is the time in seconds required to charge the capacitor to 63% of the supply voltage.

Time Constant = R * C

R is the value of the resistor in ohms and C is the value of the capacitor in farads.
