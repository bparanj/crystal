There are open source tools available to convert a JavaScript file to a TypeScript file. The most common approach is to use TypeScript itself, as it inherently supports JavaScript. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Rename your JavaScript file to TypeScript**: Simply change the file extension from `.js` to `.ts`. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.

2. **Add TypeScript Configuration**: Create a `tsconfig.json` file in your project root. This file configures the TypeScript compiler options. You can start with a simple configuration and expand it as needed.

3. **TypeScript Compiler (tsc)**: Run the TypeScript compiler (tsc) on your newly renamed TypeScript file. This process will highlight any issues that TypeScript finds based on its default type checking.

4. **Address TypeScript Errors and Warnings**: You may need to add type annotations or make other modifications to your code to resolve any errors or warnings generated by TypeScript.

5. **Use Additional Tools for Complex Cases**: For larger codebases or more complex conversions, you might consider tools like:
   - **ts-migrate**: A tool by Airbnb designed to help migrate code to TypeScript. It helps automate some of the more tedious and predictable parts of a TypeScript migration.
   - **Google's tsickle**: Aimed at converting TypeScript to a form that can be consumed by the Closure Compiler.

Remember, while these tools assist in the conversion process, manual intervention and code review are often necessary to ensure optimal type safety and adherence to TypeScript best practices.
