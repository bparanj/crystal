Systematic approach to analyze customer reviews and identify market opportunities. 

1. First, let's analyze the reviews. We'll want to:
- Extract key pain points and complaints
- Identify unmet needs or desired features
- Analyze sentiment and emotional responses
- Look for patterns in feature requests
- Categorize problems by frequency and severity

Would you like to share some of these reviews? I can help create an analysis system using AI tools to process them and identify patterns. I can:

1. Use natural language processing to categorize feedback
2. Create sentiment analysis to understand emotional intensity
3. Extract specific feature requests and complaints
4. Generate actionable insights for product development

From there, we can:
- Identify the most valuable problems to solve
- Evaluate market size for each opportunity
- Assess technical feasibility
- Estimate development costs and potential revenue
- Create a minimum viable product plan

Would you like to share some of the reviews so we can start with a practical analysis? Or would you prefer me to create a general framework first?
