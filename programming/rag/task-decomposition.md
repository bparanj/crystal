**High-Level Goal:** Build a minimal viable product (MVP) for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that takes a set of PDF documents, and answers user queries by retrieving relevant context and generating responses.

**Phase 1: Data Preparation**  
1. **Document Ingestion**:  
   - Task: Identify a set of PDFs and load their contents into the application.
   - Subtasks:  
     - Read PDFs using a Python library (e.g., `pypdf`).  
     - Extract raw text from each PDF page.  
     - Store extracted text temporarily (e.g., in memory or a local directory).

2. **Text Preprocessing**:  
   - Task: Clean and structure the extracted text for embedding and retrieval.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - Normalize whitespace, remove unnecessary characters.  
     - Split text into smaller, meaningful chunks (e.g., 500 tokens each).  
     - Associate metadata (document title, section headings) with each chunk.

**Phase 2: Embeddings & Indexing**  
1. **Embedding Generation**:  
   - Task: Transform text chunks into vector embeddings.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - Choose a pre-trained embedding model (e.g., Sentence Transformers).  
     - Encode each chunk into a vector representation.  
     - Store the resulting vectors in memory for now.

2. **Vector Store Setup**:  
   - Task: Index the embeddings to enable efficient similarity search.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - Initialize a vector database (e.g., FAISS or Chroma).  
     - Insert all chunk embeddings and metadata into the vector store.  
     - Confirm that you can query the vector store and retrieve the nearest chunks.

**Phase 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Logic**  
1. **Retriever Integration**:  
   - Task: Connect the vector store to a retrieval function.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - Implement a function `retrieve_context(query)` that:  
       - Embeds the user query.  
       - Finds top-k similar text chunks from the vector store.  
       - Returns these chunks as context.

2. **LLM Integration**:  
   - Task: Incorporate a large language model to generate answers using retrieved context.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - Choose an LLM API or local model (e.g., OpenAI API, local GPT model).  
     - Implement a `generate_answer(query, context_chunks)` function that:  
       - Formats the prompt with retrieved chunks plus the userâ€™s query.  
       - Calls the LLM to produce a final answer.

3. **RAG Pipeline Construction**:  
   - Task: Combine retrieval and generation into a single pipeline.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - Implement a `answer_query(query)` function that:  
       - Calls `retrieve_context(query)` to get relevant chunks.  
       - Calls `generate_answer(query, context_chunks)` to produce the answer.  
       - Returns the final answer to the user.

**Phase 4: MVP Front-End or Interface**  
1. **Simple Input/Output Interface**:  
   - Task: Provide a user interface to ask questions and display answers.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - A basic command-line interface (CLI) or a simple web form.  
     - On user query submission, call `answer_query(query)`.  
     - Print or display the returned answer.

2. **Testing & Validation**:  
   - Task: Verify that the system works end-to-end.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - Ask known questions and verify the accuracy of answers.  
     - Check if the retrieval brings context relevant to the query.  
     - Ensure that the LLM uses the retrieved context to answer factually.

---

**Phase 5: Refinements (Optional Enhancements)**  
1. **Adjust Retrieval Parameters**:  
   - Increase or decrease the number of chunks retrieved to improve accuracy.
  
2. **Prompt Engineering**:  
   - Improve the prompt template that feeds context to the LLM to yield clearer, more accurate answers.
  
3. **Metadata Filters**:  
   - Use metadata (document titles, sections) to refine retrieval results for better relevance.

4. **Persistence & Deployment**:  
   - Store embeddings and vector indexes to disk for persistence.
   - Deploy the solution on a simple hosting environment for user access.

**Key Takeaways of Task Decomposition**:  
- Start by ingesting and preprocessing PDFs.  
- Encode chunks into embeddings and build a vector store.  
- Implement a retrieval method, integrate an LLM for generation, and tie them together.  
- Present a minimal interface and refine parameters to improve performance.
