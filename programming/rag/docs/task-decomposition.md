**Overall Goal:** 

Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) MVP using locally preprocessed documents (PDFs and text files), OpenAI for embeddings and generation, Pinecone for vector storage, LangChain for orchestration, and a Vue front end hosted on Vercel. No login needed and minimal additional features.

### Phase 1: Document Preprocessing (Local)

**Task 1: Extract Text from PDFs and Text Files**  

- Use `pypdf` (or `pdfplumber`) to extract text from PDFs.  
- For text files, simply read the contents.  
- Store raw extracted text temporarily in memory.

**Task 2: Clean and Normalize Text**  

- Remove extra whitespace and special characters as needed.  
- Optionally apply basic regex patterns to tidy up text.  
- Keep domain in mind (basic analog electronic circuits), but no advanced domain-specific cleaning right now.

**Task 3: Chunk the Text**  

- Split the cleaned text into ~500-token segments.  
- For PDFs, keep track of page numbers. For both PDFs and text files, record the source filename.  
- Add a timestamp of when the chunk was generated.

**Task 4: Store Chunks as JSON Files**  

- For each source document, create a JSON file with a list of chunks.  
- Each chunk entry includes: `text`, `metadata` (filename, page number if applicable, timestamp).

### Phase 2: Embedding & Indexing (Local, Separate Script)

**Task 5: Embed Chunks Using OpenAI**  

- Load JSON files created in Phase 1.  
- Use OpenAI embeddings to convert each chunk into a vector.

**Task 6: Store Embeddings in Pinecone**  

- Connect to Pinecone using API keys from environment variables.  
- Index each chunk’s embedding and metadata in Pinecone.  
- Confirm the indexing by testing a simple query.

### Phase 3: Backend Query Endpoint (Vercel Serverless Function)

**Task 7: Setup Backend Endpoint**  

- Create a serverless function on Vercel.  
- This function takes a user query, uses OpenAI to embed the query, and queries Pinecone for similar chunks.

**Task 8: Construct RAG Prompt and Generate Answer**  

- Take top retrieved chunks from Pinecone.  
- Format a prompt that includes the retrieved text as context plus the user’s question.  
- Call the OpenAI API to generate the final answer.

**Task 9: Return the Answer**  

- Send the generated answer back as a JSON response for the frontend to display.

### Phase 4: Frontend (Vue on Vercel)

**Task 10: Build a Minimal Vue Interface**  

- A text field for the user to input the question.  
- A button to submit the query to the backend.  
- A simple area to display the returned answer.

**Task 11: Integrate with Backend**  

- Send queries from the Vue app to the backend endpoint using fetch or Axios.  
- Handle loading states and error messages minimally.

**Task 12: Deploy Frontend and Backend to Vercel**  

- Configure Vercel environment variables (for Pinecone and OpenAI).  
- Deploy the static Vue build and the serverless function.

### Phase 5: Validation & Adjustments

**Task 13: Test the End-to-End Pipeline**  

- Ask sample questions to ensure relevant chunks are retrieved and the final answers are coherent.  
- Adjust chunk size or prompt formatting if initial results are suboptimal.

**Task 14 (Optional): Refinement**  

- If needed, tweak preprocessing steps, retrieval parameters, or prompt engineering.  
- If desired, implement optional improvements (e.g., a search bar, basic CSS styling, etc.).

**Decisions Incorporated:**

- Documents: PDFs and text files only, a few dozen in number.
- Domain: Basic analog electronic circuits.
- Preprocessing: Done locally with a Python script.  
- Storage: JSON files for the processed chunks.
- Embeddings & LLM: OpenAI.
- Vector Store: Pinecone.
- Framework: LangChain.
- Hosting: Vercel for both backend (serverless function) and frontend (Vue app).
- No authentication required, minimal interface.
- Default chunk size and simple cleaning first, can adjust later.

**High-Level Goal:** 

Build a minimal viable product (MVP) for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that takes a set of PDF documents, and answers user queries by retrieving relevant context and generating responses.

**Phase 1: Data Preparation**  

1. **Document Ingestion**:  
   - Task: Identify a set of PDFs and load their contents into the application.
   - Subtasks:  
     - Read PDFs using a Python library (e.g., `pypdf`).  
     - Extract raw text from each PDF page.  
     - Store extracted text temporarily (e.g., in memory or a local directory).

2. **Text Preprocessing**:  
   - Task: Clean and structure the extracted text for embedding and retrieval.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - Normalize whitespace, remove unnecessary characters.  
     - Split text into smaller, meaningful chunks (e.g., 500 tokens each).  
     - Associate metadata (document title, section headings) with each chunk.

**Phase 2: Embeddings & Indexing**  

1. **Embedding Generation**:  
   - Task: Transform text chunks into vector embeddings.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - Choose a pre-trained embedding model (e.g., Sentence Transformers).  
     - Encode each chunk into a vector representation.  
     - Store the resulting vectors in memory for now.

2. **Vector Store Setup**:  
   - Task: Index the embeddings to enable efficient similarity search.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - Initialize a vector database (e.g., FAISS or Chroma).  
     - Insert all chunk embeddings and metadata into the vector store.  
     - Confirm that you can query the vector store and retrieve the nearest chunks.

**Phase 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Logic**  

1. **Retriever Integration**:  
   - Task: Connect the vector store to a retrieval function.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - Implement a function `retrieve_context(query)` that:  
       - Embeds the user query.  
       - Finds top-k similar text chunks from the vector store.  
       - Returns these chunks as context.

2. **LLM Integration**:  
   - Task: Incorporate a large language model to generate answers using retrieved context.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - Choose an LLM API or local model (e.g., OpenAI API, local GPT model).  
     - Implement a `generate_answer(query, context_chunks)` function that:  
       - Formats the prompt with retrieved chunks plus the user’s query.  
       - Calls the LLM to produce a final answer.

3. **RAG Pipeline Construction**:  
   - Task: Combine retrieval and generation into a single pipeline.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - Implement a `answer_query(query)` function that:  
       - Calls `retrieve_context(query)` to get relevant chunks.  
       - Calls `generate_answer(query, context_chunks)` to produce the answer.  
       - Returns the final answer to the user.

**Phase 4: MVP Front-End or Interface**  

1. **Simple Input/Output Interface**:  
   - Task: Provide a user interface to ask questions and display answers.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - A basic command-line interface (CLI) or a simple web form.  
     - On user query submission, call `answer_query(query)`.  
     - Print or display the returned answer.

2. **Testing & Validation**:  
   - Task: Verify that the system works end-to-end.  
   - Subtasks:  
     - Ask known questions and verify the accuracy of answers.  
     - Check if the retrieval brings context relevant to the query.  
     - Ensure that the LLM uses the retrieved context to answer factually.

**Phase 5: Refinements (Optional Enhancements)**  

1. **Adjust Retrieval Parameters**:  
   - Increase or decrease the number of chunks retrieved to improve accuracy.
  
2. **Prompt Engineering**:  
   - Improve the prompt template that feeds context to the LLM to yield clearer, more accurate answers.
  
3. **Metadata Filters**:  
   - Use metadata (document titles, sections) to refine retrieval results for better relevance.

4. **Persistence & Deployment**:  
   - Store embeddings and vector indexes to disk for persistence.
   - Deploy the solution on a simple hosting environment for user access.

**Task Decomposition**:

- Start by ingesting and preprocessing PDFs.  
- Encode chunks into embeddings and build a vector store.  
- Implement a retrieval method, integrate an LLM for generation, and tie them together.  
- Present a minimal interface and refine parameters to improve performance.
