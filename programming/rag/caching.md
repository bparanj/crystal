For local development, the **SQLite Cache** is the most suitable approach because:

1. It persists data between program runs, so you don't lose your cached responses when you restart your program
2. It's file-based, so no need to run additional services (unlike Redis)
3. It's simple to set up and use
4. The cache file is portable and easy to delete if you want to start fresh

Here's the minimal code you need:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.cache import SQLiteCache
from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache
import os

# Setup SQLite cache
set_llm_cache(SQLiteCache(database_path="cache.db"))

# Initialize ChatOpenAI
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    temperature=0,
    model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo",
)

# Your API calls will now be automatically cached
response = llm.invoke("What is 2+2?")
```

If you ever need to clear the cache, simply:
```python
import os
if os.path.exists("cache.db"):
    os.remove("cache.db")
```

The in-memory cache would be lost every time you restart your program, and Redis would be overkill for local development since it requires running a Redis server.

Yes, SQLite caching works perfectly with Jupyter notebooks! In fact, it's particularly useful in notebooks since you often run cells multiple times during development.

Here's how to use it in a Jupyter notebook:

```python
# First cell - Setup
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.cache import SQLiteCache
from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache
import os

# Set up cache - this needs to be run once per notebook session
set_llm_cache(SQLiteCache(database_path="cache.db"))

# Initialize ChatOpenAI
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    temperature=0,
    model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo",
)
```

```python
# Second cell - Test caching
# First run will hit the API
response1 = llm.invoke("What is the capital of France?")
print("Response:", response1)

# Run this cell again - it will use cached response
# You'll notice it's much faster and won't count against your API quota
```

One tip specifically for Jupyter: If you want to clear the cache and start fresh, you can add this cell:

```python
# Optional cell - Clear cache
import os
if os.path.exists("cache.db"):
    os.remove("cache.db")
    print("Cache cleared!")
# Remember to rerun the setup cell after clearing the cache
```

The cache will persist even if you:
1. Restart the kernel
2. Close and reopen the notebook
3. Shutdown Jupyter and start it again

This makes it perfect for development and experimentation in Jupyter notebooks while saving on API costs.

## Approach #2

Below is a straightforward approach to caching calls from `ChatOpenAI` (or any OpenAI endpoint) so you can save on API costs while experimenting. The idea is:

1. **Check if the current request is in the cache.**  
2. If yes, return the cached response.  
3. If no, call the API, store the response in the cache, then return it.

This example stores prompts and responses in a JSON file. You can adapt this to any storage system (database, Redis, etc.).

```python
import os
import openai
import hashlib
import json

# Set your actual API key here or via environment variable
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "your-openai-api-key")

# Cache file for storing prompt-response pairs
CACHE_FILE = "openai_cache.json"

# Load existing cache if it exists
if os.path.exists(CACHE_FILE):
    with open(CACHE_FILE, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        cache = json.load(f)
else:
    cache = {}

def chat_completion_with_cache(prompt: str, model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    """
    Return the response for a given prompt from the cache if available,
    otherwise call OpenAI API and store the result in the cache.
    """
    # Hash the prompt to create a consistent key
    prompt_hash = hashlib.sha256(prompt.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()

    # Check if it's in the cache
    if prompt_hash in cache:
        print("[CACHE HIT]")
        return cache[prompt_hash]

    # Otherwise, call the API
    print("[CACHE MISS] Calling OpenAI API...")
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model_name,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )

    # Store in cache
    cache[prompt_hash] = response
    with open(CACHE_FILE, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        json.dump(cache, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)

    return response

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_prompt = "What are some good resources for learning Python?"
    answer = chat_completion_with_cache(user_prompt)
    print(answer.choices[0].message["content"])
```

### Key Points

- **Hashing the Prompt**:  
  You might store the full prompt as the key, but hashing it (e.g., SHA-256) avoids issues with extremely long strings as keys in JSON or databases.

- **JSON Cache File**:  
  - Reads and writes to `openai_cache.json`.  
  - Ensures data persists across runs, so you donâ€™t repeatedly call the API for the same prompt.

- **Expanding to a Conversation**:  
  - For multi-message conversations, build a combined string (or a more structured key) as the prompt.  
  - Or, store each conversation turn under a conversation ID if you want to retrieve entire dialogues.

- **Handling Model Updates**:  
  - Include the model name in the hash if you change or experiment with multiple models.  
  - Otherwise, your old cached data might be returned when switching between, say, `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4`.

This pattern is flexible. You can:
- Replace the JSON file with a database.
- Add time-to-live (TTL) for invalidation.
- Use the same logic for completion endpoints or any other OpenAI API.

## Libraries

There are several Python libraries specifically designed to help save money on OpenAI API calls:

1. **LiteLLM** - One of the most popular options
```python
from litellm import Cache
from litellm import completion

# Setup caching
Cache.enable() # Defaults to redis caching

# Make calls
response = completion(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hey, how's it going?"}]) 
```

2. **OpenAI Proxy** - Similar to LiteLLM but with different features
```python
from openai_proxy import OpenAIProxy

proxy = OpenAIProxy()
response = proxy.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

3. **Semantic Cache** - Specialized in semantic caching for similar (not just identical) queries
```python
from semantic_cache import SemanticCache

cache = SemanticCache()
response = cache.get_completion("What is Python?")
```

For local development, I'd recommend LiteLLM as it's:
- Actively maintained
- Has good documentation
- Supports multiple caching backends
- Includes features like retry logic and fallbacks
- Can track spending

You can install it with:
```bash
pip install litellm
```
