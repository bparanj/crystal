The models were less sophisticated and more uncertain than they are today, but the implications were already worrying. Thirty years later much has changed. The threat is now more immediate, but the world is also taking action\u2014from governmental policy and technology innovation to actions by individuals and organizations\u2014driven by a broader awareness of the danger.\nI worked on Search for 20 years, leading the product for \nmany of those, and learned a lot about the unique impact Google can have on the world. I\u2019ve always been proud of Google\u2019s leadership in pushing the boundaries of sustainability in our data centers, including achieving carbon neutrality in 2007 (at the time, such accomplishments were uncommon). Going further, we\u2019ve matched 100% of our global electricity use with renewable energy purchases for the last six years\u2014a goal that seemed almost crazy when we set it in 2012. \nToday our ambitions have evolved\u2014we now have a bold \ngoal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, and as part of that goal, to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where we operate. The path to get to these goals is difficult, and we\u2019re committed to working through the challenges we face with the ultimate aim of driving larger systems change to create a more sustainable future. Further, predicting the future growth of energy use and emissions from AI compute in our data centers is difficult. Despite this, we remain focused on developing new ways to make AI computing more efficient while leveraging the opportunities that AI presents to have a positive environmental impact. \nBeyond our own footprint, Google\u2019s founding mission\u2014\n\u201cOrganize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful\u201d\u2014can play a very important role in accelerating progress in climate information and action. A sustainable future will be built upon billions of decisions made by governments, organizations, and individuals, which will need to be grounded in good information. Increasingly, we see through Google Trends that more and more people are looking for ways to live sustainably. I believe that we have many strengths and capabilities in providing quality information that people are seeking to make decisions that\u2019ll drive positive action for our planet.\nHelpful information  can be critical in both efforts to reduce \nemissions as well as adapt to extreme climate events like \nfloods, wildfires, and heat waves. But this information often lives in silos and is hard to access. Making the information accessible and useful can be a tough technical challenge. Our products like Environmental Insights Explorer, Earth Engine, and Data Commons are key solutions to support the decisions that cities and organizations will have to make. Information can also have a significant impact on the decisions of individuals\u2014particularly in the areas of home energy and transportation. Our products like Maps, Search, and Nest reach billions of users around the world, and we\u2019re building many features to respond to the demand for that information in our products. \nGiven the scale of the problem, innovation  will also be \nkey to getting us to a better future. In order to push the \nfrontiers of innovation, Google has long had a world-class research organization that\u2019s been at the forefront of AI and machine learning. These solutions can help in predicting \nmore extreme weather (flood forecasting, for instance), optimizing systems from traffic lights to car routes, and mitigating climate change in new ways, for example. \nIn our 2023 Environmental Report, we\u2019re highlighting how \nthese themes of information and innovation run through much of our work:\nFor information, we\u2019ll feature Google Trends  \ninsights alongside key initiatives to show how our work is informed by societal trends and\u00a0expectations.\nAnd for innovation, we\u2019ll call out the many  \nplaces where AI is helping to break down  barriers and advance our work.\nOver my tenure at Google, I\u2019ve seen how we\u2019ve been working to integrate sustainability into our work. This transition is going to be challenging\u2014both for us and for the world at large\u2014and there\u2019s no playbook for making it happen. But we see our efforts as part of a bigger picture, setting our goals to help scale global solutions, and I\u2019m optimistic that we can, through our efforts in both information and innovation, play a helpful role in building a more sustainable and resilient future.\nBenedict  Gomes\nBenedict GomesSVP, Learning & SustainabilityGoogleBy making information accessible and \naccelerating innovation, we can help \ncreate a more sustainable future.   5\n2023 Environmental Report  \nA letter from our  \nChief Sustainability Officer\nI grew up in Muir Beach, California, and was fortunate \nto spend my childhood exploring its beautiful redwood forests and vibrant tidepools with my family. Today, I\u2019m raising my daughter in these same special places, but now these delicate ecosystems are threatened, just like many other parts of the world. \nClimate change affects all aspects of society, from food \nproduction and human health to infrastructure and the economy. These impacts are interconnected and can have a cascading effect on people and the planet. The response calls for systemic, global action to reduce emissions, improve watershed health, maximize the reuse of finite resources, and protect biodiversity.\nSince Google was founded, our efforts to mitigate climate \nchange have started with our own operations, and we\u2019ve worked hard to lead by example with the ultimate goal of driving larger systemic change. In our third decade of climate action, we\u2019ll continue to take a science-based approach to our efforts, while sharing our own lessons and progress with others. \nI joined Google eight years ago to lead our sustainability \nefforts, and have witnessed our sense of urgency and ambition firsthand. We\u2019re empowering individuals, governments, businesses, and other organizations to make decisions that can drive positive action for people and our planet.\nThe opportunity we have through our products and \nplatforms is reflected in our updated environmental sustainability strategy, which focuses on where we can make the most significant positive impact. Our work is organized around three key pillars: empowering individuals to take action, working together with our partners and customers, and operating our business\u00a0sustainably.\nIn 2022, we reached our goal to help 1 billion people \nmake more sustainable choices through our products. We achieved this by offering sustainability features like eco-friendly routing in Google Maps, energy efficiency features in Google Nest thermostats, and carbon emissions information in Google Flights. Looking ahead, our aspiration is to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce 1 gigaton of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030.\n\u20092\nAfter two years of condensed reporting, we\u2019re sharing a deeper dive into our approach in one place in our 2023 Environmental Report. In 2022, we continued to make measurable progress in many key ways, such as:\n\u2022 We enhanced and launched new sustainabilityproduct features , such as eco-friendly routing in\nMaps, which is estimated to have helped preventmore than 1.2 million metric tons of carbon emissionsfrom launch through 2022\u2014equivalent to takingapproximately 250,000 fuel-based cars off the roadfor a year.\n\u20093\n\u2022 We expanded the availability of Google EarthEngine \u2014which provides access to reliable, up-to-\ndate insights on how our planet is changing\u2014toinclude businesses and governments worldwide as anenterprise-grade service through Google Cloud.\u2022 We opened our new Bay View campus , which is\nall-electric, net water-positive, restores over 17 acresof high-value nature, and incorporates the leadingprinciples of circular design.\n\u2022 We signed 20 more renewable energy agreements,bringing our total to more than 80 agreementstotaling approximately 10 GW of clean energygeneration capacity\u2014we estimate we\u2019ll spendapproximately $10 billion to purchase clean energythrough 2040.\n\u20094\nWe expect this new era of technological innovation to open up even greater opportunities to accelerate system-level change. It\u2019s a big part of the reason we\u2019re optimistic about what\u2019s possible in the years ahead. If we move forward collectively and decisively, there\u2019s no limit to  what we can achieve.\nKate E. Brandt\nKate E.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and the power of information to help individuals and organizations reduce emissions are two emerging opportunities that Google is focusing on to help build a more sustainable future.\nAI for sustainability\nSeven years into our journey as an AI-first company, we\u2019ve made AI foundational  to every part of our business and \nall Google products. Our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible . To us, that means developing AI in a \nway that maximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI Principles . \nWe can use AI to help accelerate solutions to tackle climate change by providing better information  to \nindividuals, operational optimization  for organizations, \nand improved prediction  and forecasting. We must \nalso continue to find ways to reduce the environmental footprint  of AI models.\nInformation: Empowering people to live more sustainably through AI.  In 2022, searches for  \n   \u201csolar energy,\u201d       \u201celectric bicycles,\u201d    and  \n   \u201celectric cars\u201d   reached all-time highs.\u200913 People are \ninterested in how to live more sustainably, and our goal is to make it easier for them to do so. Features like eco-friendly routing in Google Maps leverage AI to help people get to their destinations as quickly as possible while minimizing fuel or battery consumption. Eco-friendly routing has helped prevent 1.2 million metric tons of estimated carbon emissions since launch\u2014equivalent to taking approximately 250,\n000 fuel-based cars off the road for a year.\u200914 \nAdditionally, for over a decade, our Nest Learning Thermostats have used machine learning (ML) to help people save energy and money at home. From 2011 to 2022, Nest thermostats have helped customers cumulatively save more than 113 billion kWh of energy\n\u200915\u2014more than double Portugal\u2019s annual electricity \nconsumption\u200916 and equivalent to avoiding an estimated  \n36 million tCO2e emissions.\u200917 \nOptimization: Bringing carbon-efficient computing to customers and partners.  We\u2019ve made significant \ninvestments in cleaner cloud computing by making our data centers some of the most efficient in the world and sourcing more carbon-free energy. We\u2019re helping our customers make real-time decisions to reduce emissions, and mitigate climate risks with data and AI. For example, Google Cloud customers can reduce their cloud footprint with a feature called Active Assist, which uses machine learning to identify unused (and potentially wasteful) workloads that could reduce carbon emissions if\u00a0removed.\nOur planet, as seen via Google Earth \u00a92020 Landsat / Copernicus\nWe believe that AI is a foundational and transformational technology that will provide compelling and helpful \nbenefits to people and society through its capacity to assist, complement, empower, and inspire people in almost every field of human endeavor. It has the potential to contribute to tackling some of society\u2019s most pressing challenges and opportunities\u2014among these, climate and sustainability, where we\u2019re researching and innovating to help unlock scientific discoveries and to assist people in making informed choices and communities impacted by climate change. \nWe believe that getting AI right\u2014which to us involves innovating and delivering widely accessible benefits to \npeople and society, while mitigating its risks\u2014must be a collective effort involving us and others, including researchers, developers, users (individuals, businesses, and other organizations), governments, regulators, and citizens. It\u2019s critical that we collectively earn public trust if AI is to deliver on its potential for people and society. As a company, we embrace the opportunity to work with others to get AI right.\nJames ManyikaSVP, Research, Technology, & SocietyGoogle\n   10\n2023 Environmental Report  \nWe\u2019re making advancements  in many \ntransformative areas of AI, but I\u2019m particularly \nexcited about AI for Social Good, including  climate adaptation. AI has great potential to  both reduce overall emissions as well as help us address the effects of climate change, including helping people adapt to new challenges.\nJeff DeanChief ScientistGoogle DeepMind and \nGoogle R\nesearch\nOptimization: Helping communities with AI-powered climate action planning.  Green Light is an AI-based tool \nthat helps city traffic engineers optimize the timing of  light changes to reduce stop-and-go traffic. Our recent tests in Hamburg, Germany, showed that at traffic lights with our AI-driven recommendations, cars made over 25% fewer stops, resulting in approximately 10% fewer emissions.\n\u200918 The Environmental Insights Explorer  (EIE) is \na freely available online tool built with and for cities and regions to support effective climate action planning. Many features in EIE are made possible through machine learning, such as estimating the solar potential of rooftops, calculating transportation emissions, and mapping tree canopy coverage. \nPrediction: Using AI to help communities address \nextreme weather events.  AI-powered tools can help \naddress some of the worst impacts of climate-related disasters , from early warnings of natural disasters to \nreducing the impact of wildfires. In 2022, we launched Flood Hub, which allows local governments and aid organizations to identify when a riverine flood will occur, up to seven days in advance. In early 2023, we expanded this tool from 20 to 80 countries across the globe. By using AI to analyze satellite imagery, we\u2019re also helping to enable rapid detection when a wildfire starts and to predict how it will spread, enabling authorities to better manage fires and provide emergency alerts to individuals who are at\u00a0risk.\nPrediction: Using AI to predict locust outbreaks, \nhelping farmers protect their crops. Locust infestations can have a devastating effect on food crops. Through collaborations with AI product-focused company InstaDeep and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the Google AI Center in Ghana is building a model  that forecasts locust \nbreeding grounds using historical data from the FAO and environmental variables like rainfall and temperature. This model will help to better detect locust outbreaks and enable farmers to implement control measures.\nPrediction: Using generative modeling for nowcasting \nrain. We\u2019re using generative modeling  to make detailed \nand plausible predictions, up to two hours ahead, that capture the amount, timing, and location of rainfall. With such methods, we can both accurately capture large-scale events, while also generating alternative rain scenarios. We\u2019re interested in the ability of these models to make predictions on medium- to heavy-rain events, which most impact people and the economy.\nEnvironmental footprint: Leveraging AI to optimize \nour own operations, and working to reduce energy use and emissions from AI computing in our data centers.  \nAI and machine learning workloads are quickly becoming larger and more capable, raising concerns about their energy use and their impact on the environment. With AI at an inflection point, predicting the future growth of energy use and emissions from AI compute in our data centers is challenging. Historically, research  has shown \nthat as AI/ML compute demand has gone up, the energy needed to power this technology has increased at a much slower rate than many forecasts predicted. We have used tested practices to reduce the carbon footprint of workloads by large margins; together these principles have reduced the energy of training a model by up to 100x and emissions by up to 1,000x. We plan to continue applying these tested practices and to keep developing new ways to make AI computing more efficient.\nGoogle data centers are designed, built, and operated to \nmaximize efficiency\u2014even as computing demand grows. On average, a Google-owned and -operated data center is more than 1.5 times as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center\n\u200919 and, compared with five years \nago, we now deliver approximately three times as much computing power with the same amount of electrical power.\n\u200920 To support the next generation of fundamental \nadvances in AI, our latest TPU v4  is proven to be one \nof the fastest, most efficient , and most sustainable ML \ninfrastructure hubs in the world.We\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019ve already made \nin developing more sustainable tools and products that harness the power of AI, and we\u2019re optimistic about the progress we\u2019ll unlock in the years ahead.\nAI is one of the most transformational \ntechnologies of our time. I believe it has  the potential to unlock major benefits for  us all, including tackling climate change.  At Google DeepMind, we\u2019re committed to driving responsible research that can make  a positive and lasting impact on society.  I\u2019m hopeful AI will accelerate scientific progress and help us address a number of global challenges to leave the world a better place for the generations that follow.\nLila IbrahimChief Operating OfficerGoogle DeepMind\nA row of servers in our  \nSt. Ghislain, Belgium, data center   11\n2023 Environmental Report  \nOur gigaton aspiration\nWe believe that Google has a unique \nopportunity that extends beyond reducing the environmental impacts of our own operations and value chain.\n\u200921 \nIn 2020, Google shared our aspiration to help others reduce \n1 gigaton (GT) of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. This is an ambitious vision that we\u2019ve set to push us to contribute meaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain.\nWe initially focused on helping cities and local \ngovernments reduce 1 GT of emissions. A key tool in this effort is the Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE), which provides actionable climate and sustainability data to government officials in cities and regions worldwide. It\u2019s been used in multiple ways across the globe, including by city leaders in Dublin to analyze bicycle usage and inform smart transportation policies, and by the city of Austin to prioritize planting trees in areas with the highest need.\nTo better reflect the broader group of partners we aim to \nhelp, we\u2019re updating our shared\u00a0ambition:\nASPIRATION\nWe aim to help individuals, cities,  \nand other partners collectively reduce 1 gigaton of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030.For context, 1 GT is comparable to the entire annual \nemissions of Japan.\u200922 Helping others to reduce 1 GT of \ncarbon equivalent emissions per year, starting in 2030, is a bold aspiration focused on where we can have the most impact\u2014enabling others to reduce emissions in key areas like energy and transportation. Our ultimate measure of success will be how much we\u2019ve helped individuals, cities, and other partners to achieve their own greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals.\nMany of the solutions to achieve a gigaton of carbon \nemission reductions don\u2019t yet exist. However this ambition pushes us to innovate and be audacious in our approach and to collaborate with others to drive systemic solutions. We\u2019ll share progress and learnings along the\u00a0way.\nEstimating impact\nEstimating the carbon impact of actions taken by many millions of people, communities, and organizations will be inherently difficult, imprecise, and fundamentally different from measuring a corporate carbon footprint. However, it\u2019s also useful to enable us to prioritize the most helpful solutions for others. \nAfter reviewing emerging best practices and applying our \ninternal product measurement expertise to advance our measurement work, we\u2019ve identified a set of approaches and known challenges that will inform how we estimate enabled emissions reductions.Approaches\nConsider carbon accounting principles Established carbon accounting principles (such as well-defined baselines and true and fair representation of data) provide helpful insights as we develop estimation methodologies for enabled emissions reductions.\nQuantify and evaluate real world action \nThe data available to us from our technology, products, or services may be several steps removed from actual, real-world action and impact that resulted in reduced or avoided emissions. We\u2019ll have to use inference and judgment to evaluate the effect of those actions.\nChallenges\nUnintended impactsEmissions reduction efforts don\u2019t happen in isolation. Actions in one industry or sector might result in net new emissions in another. Similarly, emissions reductions in one area can sometimes lead to increases in another. These are difficult effects to control for, but they must be considered when estimating enabled emissions reductions. Inherent uncertainty  \nUncertainty is inherent to most GHG accounting methodologies and results, and it increases when considering enabled emissions reductions due to a lack of primary data and precise information about real-world actions and their effects. However, understanding the sources, types, and magnitude of uncertainty is crucial to deploy conservative estimates, inform improved data inputs, and properly interpret results.\nWhile carbon accounting principles and these concepts \nare a good start towards estimating enabled emissions reductions, we expect that methodologies will rapidly evolve, and we welcome the opportunity to collaborate with others to advance best practices. \nThe Empowering individuals  and Working together  \nsections include many examples of how we\u2019re already \nsupporting and enabling individuals and partners to reduce their emissions.\nThe Environmental Insights Explorer makes actionable climate data available to more than 40,000 cities and regions worldwide.   12\n2023 Environmental Report  Empowering  \nindividuals\nWe\u2019re empowering people  \nwith information to make  more sustainable choicesOur ambition\nOur approach\nHelping people make more \nsustainable choices\nReducing home energy useProviding sustainable \ntransportation options\nSharing other actionable \ninformation\nThe journey ahead\n   13\n2023 Environmental Report  Our ambition\nAt Google, we have an opportunity to lead \nthe transition to a more sustainable future by making information accessible and by driving innovation forward. Grounded in our mission, we\u2019re empowering people with the high-quality information they\u2019re looking for. Through our products and platforms that billions of users engage with every day, we\u2019re helping people make decisions that can drive positive action for our planet.\nLast year\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC) AR6 Working Group 3 Report , for the first time, \nset out measurable ways that individuals can take meaningful climate action in line with the Paris Agreement. The IPCC report offers a detailed and practical plan for societal emissions reduction, complementing the critical action required by governments, policymakers, and organizations to decarbonize energy, transport, and material systems. The report also calculates the significant well-being and economic benefits that will result from these actions, including for individuals.\nThese important findings have reinforced our conviction \nthat Google can make a meaningful difference beyond our own operations and value chain, and they highlight the benefits of helping individuals through our products and\u00a0platforms.Our approach\nEvery day, billions of people turn to Google to ask questions, discover something new, or learn about what\u2019s important to them. More people are interested in how to live more sustainably than ever, and our aim is to make it easier for them to do so. In 2022, searches for   \n   \u201csolar energy,\u201d        \u201celectric bicycles,\u201d   and  \n   \u201celectric cars\u201d   reached all-time highs.\u200923 \nThese kinds of changes to lifestyles and behavior matter: the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates  that \naround 55% of the cumulative emissions reductions needed to achieve a net-zero global energy system by 2050 are linked to consumer choices. Yet, there\u2019s a wide \u201csay-do gap \u201d among consumers\u2014between those who are \nconcerned about sustainability, and those who ultimately make sustainable decisions.\n\u200924 \nTo tackle a problem at the scale of climate change, it can be hard to know where to start. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken a first-principles approach, looking at what\u2019s contributing the most to global emissions. Home energy  \nand transportation  are two such areas\u2014collectively \nthey account for more than 20% of emissions.\n\u200925 They\u2019re \nalso sectors where people are actively searching for sustainable alternatives that often provide benefits like saving them money or time, or improving their health.\nThe accuracy and quality of the information that informs \nthese decisions is critical. When people come to us looking for answers, we aim to provide high-quality and authoritative information.FIGURE 1\nSee hybrid and electric vehicle options on Google Search\nWhen people search for car models and brands, we tag hybrid and electric options to make them easier to find.  \nAnd when people look into a specific EV, we show compatible charging stations nearby and typical charge times.\n   14\n2023 Environmental Report  Helping people make more  \nsustainable choices\nIn 2020, we announced a goal to help 1 billion people make \nmore sustainable choices through our products by 2022. We\u2019re pleased to share that we reached that goal in 2022, through innovative solutions offered to users, including:\n \u2022 Google Nest: Programmable energy efficiency \nschedules for homes that can help users save energy, money, and carbon emissions throughout the day. \u2022 Google Maps:  Eco-friendly routing feature that shows \nusers the most fuel-efficient route, based on factors such as traffic and road incline.\n \u2022 Google Travel:  Users can see associated carbon \nemissions for nearly every flight, sustainability certifications and attributes for hotels, and quickly  find more sustainable options.\nNest thermostats help people save energy at home.TARGET\nHelp 1 billion people make \nmore sustainable choices through our products by 20222022 PROGRESS\nAchieved:  Helped more than \n1 billion  users make more \nsustainable choices\nDETAILS\nYear set: 2020    |    Base year: N/A    |    Target year: 2022 \nScope: Unique, signed-in Google users that were provided information so they could make a more sustainable choice by at least one sustainability product feature.\nReducing home \nenergy use\nWe\u2019ve launched a number of products and features to \nhelp people make more informed choices about the products they buy and the energy they use.\nEnergy-efficient \nproducts\nSearches for    \u201chow to save energy \u201d   reached a 10-year \nhigh, worldwide, in 2022.\u200926 And global searches for \n   \u201cheat pumps \u201d   reached an all-time high in 2022.\u200927 \nWhen someone uses Google Search in the U.S. to look for \nfurnaces or water heaters, suggestions in the Shopping tab can help narrow their search to cost-effective and efficient options (see Figure 2).FIGURE 2\nGoogle Shopping feature for water heaters\n   15\n2023 Environmental Report  Smart thermostats\nNest thermostats  help control residential heating and \ncooling systems, saving energy  in a variety of ways. \nThe collective impact of these savings is significant. \nFrom 2011 to 2022, Nest thermostats have helped customers cumulatively save more than 113 billion kWh of energy\n\u200928\u2014more than double Portugal\u2019s annual \nelectricity consumption\u200929\u2014and equivalent to preventing \nan estimated 36 million tCO2e emissions.\u200930 In 2022 alone, \nNest thermostats helped customers save more than  26 billion kWh of energy\n\u200931\u2014more energy than Google used \nin the same year.\nNest thermostats use AI and machine learning \nto reduce energy consumption and achieve collective savings as they learn how and when to keep customers comfortable, while optimizing for energy efficiency.\nClean energy\nBecause electricity grids tend to be cleaner at certain times of day, when  we use electricity can be as important \nas how much  electricity we use. That\u2019s why we launched \nNest Renew in the United States to help individuals automatically shift their energy consumption to times of day when local grid electricity is cleaner or less expensive Features such as Energy Shift gather local power grid emissions forecasts and identify opportunities where heating or cooling a home slightly earlier or later would mean taking advantage of cleaner energy. These small actions add up; as of December 2022, we estimate that Energy Shift\n\u200932 has already helped Nest Renew users\u200933 \ncollectively prioritize cleaner energy usage for more than 110 million hours. \nFor people who want to do more to support the growth \nof clean energy from their homes, Google offers Nest Renew Premium as a paid subscription option. It matches the fossil fuel electricity used in their home with enough clean energy to cover the average U.S. household. We\u2019re working with renewable energy plants that support projects in Google\u2019s own portfolio\u2014like the Bethel Wind plant in Castro County, Texas\u2014to purchase high-quality renewable energy credits  for Nest Renew customers, \nbeyond Google\u2019s existing clean energy purchases. \nPeople can also access features like impact reports and \nthe Energy Impact Program , which lets them direct Nest \nRenew funds to nonprofit partners working toward an equitable sustainable future (see Figure 3).\n2022 HIGHLIGHT\nIn 2022 alone, Nest thermostats \nhelped customers save more than 26 billion kWh of energy\n\u200934\u2014more energy \nthan Google used in the same year.FIGURE 3\nNest Renew features\n   16\n2023 Environmental Report  Information about \nenergy\nGlobal search interest in    \u201ceco-anxiety\u201d   reached a \n15-y\near high in 2022, as did search interest in how to  \n   \u201csave energy at home,\u201d  \u200935 showing us that people \nwant\u2014and need\u00a0answers.\nDue to the energy crisis in Europe, people, businesses, \nand\u00a0governments across the continent are concerned about rising prices and increased pressure on the energy grid, which is evident from the information they\u2019re searching for. \nIn 2022, we worked with the IEA to rapidly develop a set \nof recommendations  to help individuals reduce energy \nuse at home. When people searched for topics such as \u201cEurope energy crisis\u201d and \u201cenergy price\u201d, they saw news articles, local information including financial assistance that may be available, and recommended actions to help conserve energy (see Figure 4).FIGURE 4\nEurope energy information panels\nGoing solar\nGlobal search interest in    \u201csolar energy\u201d   and \n  \u201csolar installation\u201d   reached all-time highs in 2022.\u200936 \nProject Sunroof , launched in 2015 in the United States \nand Puerto Rico, helps people decide whether to go solar. It uses AI to analyze high-resolution aerial mapping and 3D modeling of residential roofs, making estimations of solar potential faster and easier.\nExploring potential solar capacity for homes in San Francisco, California in the Project Sunroof tool.   17\n2023 Environmental Report  Providing sustainable transportation \noptions\nGlobal search interest in    \u201csustainable transport\u201d   \nreached a 15-year high in 2022.\u200937 Transportation relies \nmore heavily on fossil fuels than any other sector.\u200938 \nThis is why, for people in most high-income countries, \nchanging travel patterns is a high-impact way to reduce their footprint. We\u2019ve added several features across our products to allow people to more easily make sustainable travel and transportation decisions.\nEco-friendly routing\nA simple thing everyone can do to reduce emissions is  use existing vehicles more efficiently. Global searches for \n   \u201chow to save fuel when driving\u201d    have increased by \n60% between 2022 and 2023.\u200939 In 2021, we launched eco-\nfriendly routing in Google Maps to help people get to their destinations as quickly as possible while minimizing fuel or battery consumption (see Figure 5). By building AI models on the emissions profile of diverse vehicle types, this feature leverages insights from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory and data from the European Environment Agency to optimize fuel-efficient route choices.FIGURE 5\nEco-friendly routing\nIn 2022\n, we expanded eco-friendly routing  to Canada \nand nearly 40 European countries, as well as in Egypt ahead of COP-27. As of the end of 2022, it\u2019s estimated to have helped prevent more than 1.2 million metric tons of carbon emissions since launch\u2014equivalent to taking approximately 250,000 fuel-based cars off the road for a\u00a0year.\n\u200940 Since the most fuel-efficient route will vary by engine type, d\nrivers using eco-friendly routing in Europe, Egypt, \nthe U.S., and Canada can now select their engine type\u2014petrol or gas, diesel, hybrid, or electric vehicle (EV)\u2014in order to get the best route and most accurate fuel or energy efficiency estimates.\nElectric vehicles\nEVs accounted for nearly 14% of new global car sales in 2022,\n\u200941 and global search interest for    \u201celectric vehicles\u201d      \nreached an all-time high in 2022.\u200942\nFor people considering purchasing a new vehicle, we want to make it easy to understand when switching to a hybrid or electric vehicle makes sense for them. Search can help people figure out how much they can save by going electric by providing fuel savings estimates and information about how similar cars compare in range and emissions . We also sh\n ow which models qualify in \nthe U.S. under the latest government rebate  programs  \ndesigned to help make EVs a more affordable option. For people considering a new bike or scooter, in select Asian countries, Search provides information such as range, speed, and price for electric bikes and scooters.\nWhen EV owners search for \n   \u201cEV charging\u201d   on Google \nMaps, they\u2019ll see charging stations nearby with charger \navailability displayed in some cases. People with a car that has Google Maps built in are routed to the most convenient charging location based on factors like traffic, charge levels, and charger speed. By the end of 2022, Google Maps included nearly 300,000 EV charging locations globally.\nIn the Waze app , individuals can also find compatible \ncharging stations along their route. Thanks to local map \neditors from our Waze Community, EV data is reviewed and updated in real time to provide the most accurate, comprehensive information.\nAn EV plugged in at a charging station. Finding a place to charge your EV is easy with Google Maps.   18\n2023 Environmental Report  Sustainable commuting\nOne sustainable way to travel is to avoid driving \naltogether, which is why we\u2019re making it easier to use Google Maps for sustainable commuting in urban areas, by providing mass transit options, bike routes , bike \nshares , and walking directions.\nBy tapping on the Google Maps transit icon, individuals can get directions to their destination by bus, train, subway, and even ferry. Google Maps provides, on average, more than 2 billion kilometers (1.2 billion miles) of\u00a0public transit results per day.\nGlobal searches for \n   \u201ce-bikes\u201d   have doubled over \nthe past three years.\u200943 In 2022, we added over 90,000 \nkilometers (56,000 miles) of bike lanes  and bikeable \nroads  to Google Maps. Individuals can also find nearby \nbike and scooter shares in over 400 cities around  \nthe world.\nWe\u2019re also helping people get from point A to point B  \non foot. Google Maps offers turn-by-turn directions  \nfor pedestrians, with Immersive View and Street View offering route previews, and Live View , which uses \naugmented reality to display arrows and directions  clearly overlaid on the map.\n2022 HIGHLIGHT\nGoogle Maps provides, on average, \nmore than 2 billion kilometers  (1.2 billion miles) of public transit results per day.Long-distance travel\nWhen individuals search in Google Flights, they now see \ncarbon emissions estimates  for nearly every flight, right \nnext to price and duration (see Figure 6). Lower emissions flights are labeled with a green badge, and results can  be sorted or filtered by carbon impact. If people want to  view only flights that have lower emissions compared to the average for similar trips, they can simply tap the  \u201cLess emissions only \u201d filter. In 2022, we expanded \ncoverage of carbon emissions estimates to 99% of itineraries on Google Flights. \nFIGURE 6\nGoogle Flights emissions estimates\nWe also cre\nated the Travel Impact Model (TIM) ,  \na public and freely accessible methodology for predicting the per-passenger CO\n2 emissions produced by an \nupcoming flight. Today, the TIM powers the emissions estimates you see on Google Flights , as well as select \ntravel sites, through our work in the Travalyst coalition . Over time, we\u2019ve refined and improved the TIM with help from academic and nonprofit experts, as well as various partners in the travel industry. We then formalized these collaborative efforts  by establishing an independent \nadvisory committee to oversee future changes to the TIM. \nGoogle Search can also help people find more \nsustainable alternatives to flying  when available. \nTrips taken by train or bus often produce lower emissions and can frequently save individuals time or money over shorter distances. \nPeople can now compare train ticket prices directly on \nGoogle Search for travel in and around select countries. As an example, when looking for \n   \u201cBerlin to Vienna trains,\u201d   \nindividuals will see a new module in the search results that lets them choose their departure date and compare the available options. To\u00a0further expand individual choices for intercity travel, we\u2019ve\u00a0also started testing a similar feature for bus tickets.\nHotel accommodations\nWhen people search for travel accommodations, they can see which hotels have been certified for meeting high standards of sustainability by select independent organizations. For example, hotels certified by Green Key or EarthCheck will have an eco-certified badge  next to \ntheir name.   19\n2023 Environmental Report  Sharing other actionable information\nOutside of home energy and transportation, individuals \ncan make other sustainable choices that add up to create a positive impact. This includes understanding local air quality, accessing climate change information, identifying nearby recycling locations, or purchasing pre-owned items.\nAir quality\nAir quality around the world is being negatively impacted by air pollution and increasingly severe wildfires. We\u2019ve added a new Air Quality feature in Google Search and Maps that shows the air quality conditions for the day, whether it\u2019s unusually smoggy or dangerously smoky. Available in cities in the U.S., Singapore, Brazil, and Chile, among other locations, this data can help people consider their activities for the day, including whether to stay indoors.\nGoogle Maps and Waze both support user alerts for  \nclean air zones . A clean air zone is a designated \nurban area with high air pollution where measures are implemented to improve air quality, such as charging an entry fee to drivers of high-emissions vehicles. If a route crosses a clean air zone, the driver will be alerted to add a permit if they own one, then eligible routes will be suggested for them based on that pass.Climate change \ninformation\nWe\u2019re making it easier for people to find climate change \ninformation. When people search for    \u201cclimate change\u201d    \nin certain languages, they\u2019ll see information panels and visuals on the causes and effects of climate change, and individual actions they can take to live more sustainably, provided by authoritative sources  like the United Nations .\nWe\u2019re also engaging with individuals on climate and other environmental topics via YouTube . On Earth Day 2022, \nwe launched a Non-Fungible Planet campaign, where we teamed up with environmental non-profits, creators, and other organizations to show what makes Earth so special and worth protecting. They journeyed to one-of-a-kind locales and created videos to highlight the stress our environment is under and what we can do to help. In 2022, YouTube also held our first ever Creators for Climate Action summits, one in New York and one with TED Countdown  in London. \nTo stay safe during extreme weather events, people often \nturn to the internet with questions. For example, global search interest in \n  \u201cheat waves\u201d   reached an all-time \nhigh in July 2022.\u200944 To surface authoritative and helpful \ninformation in these moments, we\u2019re providing information through Search alerts on flooding , wildfire boundaries , and \nextreme heat . More details on how AI enables these alerts \ncan be found in the Working together  section.Recycling points\nPeople recognize that recycling plays a crucial role in preserving the future of our planet; global searches for  \n   \u201crecycling\u201d   are the highest of any sustainability action.\u200945 \nIn 2021, we launched a new feature that makes it easier for people to find nearby recycling points on Search and Maps. In addition to providing information on recycling depots  \nand waste transfer stations, we\u2019re also helping small businesses  share when they offer in-store recycling . By \nadding the new recycling attribute  to Business Profiles on \nSearch and Maps, local storefronts and shops can show  the recycling services they offer in just a few clicks\u2014whether it\u2019s for plastic bottles, packaging, or electronics.\nPre-owned items\nGlobal search interest in    \u201cslow fashion\u201d   reached  \na 15-year high in 2022.\u200946 And global searches for  \n   \u201cthrifting\u201d   have nearly tripled over the most recent \nthree-year period compared to the previous three-year period,\n\u200947 reaching a 15-year high in 2022.\u200948 The apparel \nindustry is responsible for nearly 7% of global carbon emissions, so clothing choices have a big impact on reducing both waste and emissions.\n\u200949 \nBuying pre-owned items is a small action people can take to live more sustainably. In 2022, we launched enhancements  to the Google Shopping experience in  \nthe United States for pre-owned products, such as used and refurbished products. The journey \nahead\nWhile a single individual\u2019s actions may seem small, when \nbillions of people have the tools to make more sustainable decisions, they add up to have a meaningful impact on their communities and the entire planet. \nWe\u2019re excited by the opportunity to enable climate and \nenvironmental action far beyond Google\u2019s direct impact, through information and innovation.\nLEARN MORE\n \u2022 Empowering with technology\n \u2022 Google Maps eco-friendly routing\n \u2022 Searching for sustainability with Google\n \u2022 Supporting a clean energy future with Nest Renew\n \u2022 The search for sustainability   20\n2023 Environmental Report  Working \ntogether\nWe\u2019re working together with our \npartners and customers to advance technology for sustainabilityOur ambition\nOur approach\nSupporting partners\nInvesting in breakthrough \ninnovation\nCreating ecosystems for \ncollaboration\nThe journey ahead\n   21\n2023 Environmental Report  Our ambition\nWe believe that Google has a unique \nopportunity that extends beyond reducing \nthe environmental impacts of our own \noperations and value chain. By organizing \ninformation about our planet and making \nit actionable through technology and \nplatforms, we can help partners and \ncustomers create even more positive impact.\nDigital technologies  play a critical role in industry \ntransitions, allowing us to measure and track sustainability \nprogress, optimize the use of resources, reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and enable a more circular \neconomy.\u200950 Cloud computing and digital technologies \nunderpin the transformation in many sectors, such as \nenergy, transportation, and agriculture. Research  that \nwe commissioned in 2022 found that 20%\u201325% of what\u2019s \nrequired for the EU\u2019s 2050 net-zero goal requires some \nsort of digital enablement.\u200951\nOur approach\nBy combining Google\u2019s suite of unique capabilities in \ndata, geospatial analytics, cloud computing, and AI, \nwe\u2019re enabling our partners and customers to advance \nsustainability goals. Data\nTo effectively mitigate and adapt to climate change and \nprotect ecosystems, organizations need a data-driven \nunderstanding of their impacts. Currently, much of this data \nis fragmented across thousands of silos and a multitude \nof databases. To help solve this problem, we\u2019ve curated a \nlarge catalog of Earth observation datasets in the Earth \nEngine Data Catalog . We created Environmental Insights \nExplorer , which empowers thousands of cities and regions \nwith actionable data and insights to reduce global emissions. \nMore recently, we also built Data Commons , an open-\nsource tool to organize hundreds of public sustainability \ndatasets into a single, accessible resource.\nGeospatial technology\nGoogle has made deep investments over nearly two \ndecades in geospatial technology and platforms such \nas Google Maps and Google Earth. Google Earth Engine \nis a leading technology platform for planetary-scale \nenvironmental monitoring that was launched in 2010 \nfor scientists and NGOs. In 2022, it was expanded for \ncommercial use by businesses and governments as \nan enterprise-grade service through Google Cloud. \nResearchers from academic institutions, NGOs, and \nintergovernmental organizations have leveraged and \nbuilt upon our tools for a wide variety of use cases from \nmeasuring habitat ranges to protecting forest  and  \nocean  ecosystems.\nCloud\nGoogle Cloud is helping to transform  a number of carbon-\nemitting sectors, such as energy , transportation , and \nagriculture . We\u2019ve made significant investments in cleaner \ncloud computing by making our data centers among the most efficient in the world and sourcing more carbon-free \nenergy. This enables others to expand their use of digital \ntechnologies in a more sustainable way, by monitoring and \noptimizing cloud-related emissions, and choosing cleaner \nregions in which to run their workloads.\nAI\nAs an AI-first company, we\u2019ve established a track record of \napplying AI to some of the most significant challenges facing \nhumanity, such as environmental degradation and climate change, and we see exciting opportunities for further \nimpact. AI is embedded into many of our sustainability \ninitiatives\u2014including detecting and forecasting floods and \nwildfires , helping people and cities adapt to extreme\u00a0heat , \nand protecting critical species\u00a0habitat .  \nWe\u2019re leveraging this unique suite of capabilities in three key \nways: supporting partners, investing in breakthrough \ninnovation , and creating ecosystems for collaboration .\nGovernments, aid organizations, and individuals can use Flood Hub to take timely action and prepare for riverine floods,  \nseeing locally relevant flood data and forecasts up to 7 days in advance.   22\n2023 Environmental Report  Supporting partners\nWe\u2019re building partnerships to advance sustainability \ngoals through technology across three key groups: governments and intergovernmental organizations; customers and commercial partners; and researchers, academics, and NGOs.\nGovernments and \nintergovernmental organizations\nWe\u2019re creating tools to help governments and \nintergovernmental organizations make decisions on key topics\u2014such as urban infrastructure, transportation systems, regulations, and investments \u2014that have a \nsignificant, long-term impact on people and our planet. Cities and urban areas are a particular focus for our work, since they\u2019re home to a large proportion of the global population and produce a significant amount of GHG emissions. More than half the world\u2019s population now lives in urban areas, with this number expected to grow to 68% by 2050,\n\u200952 and cities account for 70% of energy-related \ncarbon dioxide emissions globally.\u200953\nEnvironmental Insights \nExplorer\nGoogle created Environmental Insights Explorer  (EIE) with \nand for cities and regions. This freely available online tool \nbrings many of our technological advancements together to help measure emission sources, analyze data, identify strategies to reduce emissions, and adapt to climate change impacts. EIE is supported and offered to cities  for validation by leading city networks including the  \nGlobal Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy (GCoM),  \nC40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, ICLEI, and others.\nEIE makes actionable climate data available to more than \n40,000 cities and regions worldwide. Over a thousand cities globally have signed up to view their data and use the insights for their GHG inventories and climate action planning. For example, Iniciativa Clim\u00e1tica de M\u00e9xico is working with city officials to evaluate Mexico City\u2019s building emissions and the potential to generate renewable energy from rooftop solar, using data from EIE, and support from Google.org and ICLEI. \nBuilding emissions\nIn 2022, EIE released building emissions data for 4,000 new cities, bringing our total buildings data coverage to over 13,000 cities worldwide. We\u2019ve substantially increased our geographic coverage of the world, improving it by over 250%\u2014from just over 9.5 million square kilometers to over 35 million square kilometers\u2014resulting in over 50% more buildings counted and 40% more building floor area used to estimate emissions.\nTransportation emissions\nUsing anonymized traffic patterns and other geospatial information, EIE is also able to estimate transportation emissions for trips within a city\u2019s boundary. For example, in Izmir, Turkey\u2019s third most populous city, transportation emissions accounted for almost 23% of total city emissions in 2018.\n\u200954 Izmir is using EIE to assess the effectiveness of \nGHG emissions mitigation actions and apply them to policy and decision-making to align with the goals defined in the city\u2019s Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan.\nTree canopy coverage\nEIE also provides Tree Canopy Insights, which uses AI and aerial imagery to detect and map tree canopy coverage in cities (see Figure 7) to help them create cooler environments. As of March 2023, we expanded our coverage to more than 350 cities on four continents. For example, the city of Austin has used the EIE Tree Canopy tool to prioritize planting trees in vulnerable areas and help place bus shelters to increase shade.\nFIGURE 7\nEIE Tree Canopy Insights\nTree Canopy Insights uses AI and aerial \nimagery to detect and map tree canopy coverage in cities.   23\n2023 Environmental Report  Air quality\nGoogle has worked with several cities to capture \nhyperlocal air quality insights used to help improve the lives and health of residents. We partnered with Dublin City Council to map air quality street-by-street using an electric Street View car, to increase awareness of air quality levels and help implement smart transportation policies. We also partnered with New York state to launch a statewide air quality and greenhouse gas mobile monitoring initiative  in areas overburdened by \nenvironmental pollution. \nRoad traffic\nWe also know that many cities suffer from urban road traffic, which wastes fuel and creates harmful air pollution. That\u2019s why we created Green Light , an AI tool that \nmeasures driving trends at intersections and develops recommendations that city traffic engineers can use to optimize the timing of light changes to reduce stop-and-go traffic. Our recent tests in Hamburg, Germany showed that at traffic lights with our AI-driven recommendations, cars made over 25% fewer stops, resulting in approximately 10% fewer emissions at intersections.\n\u200955 \nCool roofs\nCool roofs are designed to reflect sunlight and absorb less heat, and they\u2019re especially impactful in communities that may not have access to reliable air conditioning. We\u2019re exploring how our technology\u2014such as AI algorithms and aerial imagery\u2014can help more places implement cool roofs . We\u2019re able to map out the solar reflectivity of cities \nso urban planners and governments can identify what areas would benefit most from cool roofs. We\u2019ll soon begin piloting this tool with select cities.We\u2019re exploring how AI and aerial \nimagery can be used to help cities and governments address \u201cheat islands\u201d  \nby implementing cool roofs in  relevant locations. \nAdaptation support for \ncommunities\nAs climate change increases extreme weather events \naround the world, we\u2019re also helping communities adapt to environmental changes and stay one step ahead of natural disasters. \nWildfire detection and prediction\nClimate change is increasing the frequency and severity of wildfires, which are having a devastating impact on communities and ecosystems around the world.\n\u200956 To \nminimize the impact of wildfires on communities, Google has developed a new AI-based technology to map wildfires in near real time. It uses data from geostationary satellites such as NOAA\u2019s GOES constellation to show the size of a wildfire, with data being refreshed roughly every 15\u201320 minutes. Additionally, we\u2019re collaborating with the USFS on wildfire research by using advanced simulation and AI techniques to accelerate their fire spread model.\n\u200957\nWe\u2019ve also been working closely with U.S. agencies, such as the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). USFS used Google Earth Engine and Google Cloud technology to build a Landscape Change Monitoring System to map and monitor land cover change  across the United States and support forest planning \nand post-fire recovery. Flood forecasting\nAnnually, floods cause thousands of fatalities worldwide,\u200958 \ndisrupt the lives of millions, and cause significant financial damages. \nOur Flood Forecasting Initiative , launched in 2018, uses \nAI to predict when and where riverine flooding will occur, \nhelping to keep people safe and informed. Our Flood Hub  \nplatform now displays flood forecasts to help governments, aid organizations, and at-risk communities take timely action. These breakthroughs are a result of innovative modeling approaches  that use machine learning to create scalable \nmodels in real-world settings.\nIn May 2023, we expanded coverage to territories in 60 new \ncountries across Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, \nWe\u2019re applying AI and working with fire \nauthorities to detect, track, and predict wildfires, and to help authorities respond better to new wildfire threats.\nFrom wildfire mapping, to earthquake detection and alerts to flood forecasting, we continue to find new ways for technology to be helpful at the most critical times.   24\n2023 Environmental Report  Europe, and South and Central America. Flood Hub now \ndisplays forecasts for 80 countries. This includes some of \nthe territories with the highest percentages of population exposed to flood risk and experiencing more extreme weather, covering 460 million people globally. All forecasts are displayed for free.\nWe\u2019re applying advanced machine learning \nmethods to forecast when and where riverine floods may occur, up to seven days in advance, helping to save lives and livelihoods.\nRisk to infrastructure and natural \nresources\nIn 2022, we announced our Google Cloud climate insights \nofferings  to help government agencies better understand \nthe risks to infrastructure and natural resources due to climate change.\nFor example, we partnered with the State of Hawaii \nDepartment of Transportation (HDOT), which manages 2,500 miles of highway\u2014much of which is facing risks due to erosion and sea level rise. HDOT is leveraging Google Earth Engine and other Google Cloud services for its Climate Resilience Platform, using big data and insights  to assess risk and prioritize investment decisions based on multiple climate risks, asset conditions, and community impact.Water security\nWe\u2019re putting Google\u2019s products and technology in service of helping others to study and respond to water security challenges. Improving water security requires an accurate accounting of freshwater resources and how they change over time.\nAs an example, we partnered with the United Nations \nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) and the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre to develop the Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer . Following the launch of \nthe Sustainable Development Goals, UNEP requested that all 193 member states provide indicator 6.6.1 data on the extent of their water-related ecosystems.\n\u200959 At that time, \nthe majority of member states couldn\u2019t report on this metric. To fill this gap, the Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer (sdg661.app) helps to quantify and visualize surface water changes  over the course of decades. This free, \neasy-to-use geospatial platform and data product helps decision-makers access national, sub-national, and basin-level data on freshwater ecosystems (see Figure 8).FIGURE 8\nFreshwater Ecosystems Explorer\nThe Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer helps to quantify and visualize surface water changes.\nIn addition to other water outflows, freshwater is \ntransferred to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration. Together with government and academic research  groups and the nonprofit OpenET , Google has helped \nimprove water management by supporting the automation and scaling of evapotranspiration (ET) models . These models provide estimates of how much \nwater is transferred from the land to the atmosphere, a crucial but difficult to measure process within the overall hydrological cycle. Now OpenET is making satellite-based ET data widely accessible to farmers, landowners, and water managers.    25\n2023 Environmental Report  Cloud customers and \ncommercial partners\nWe\u2019re collaborating with customers and commercial \npartners across a number of sectors\u2014including energy, transportation, agriculture, manufacturing, consumer goods, and financial services\u2014to work towards sustainability goals. \nWe\u2019re providing powerful insights to help our Google \nCloud customers around the world predict climate risk, increase visibility across their supply chain, and reduce and report on their emissions.\nCarbon footprinting\nIn 2022, we introduced the Carbon Sense Suite , which \nincludes products such as Carbon Footprint and Active Assist, and tools such as Cloud region picker . The suite is \nenabling Google Cloud customers to accurately measure, report, and reduce their cloud-related carbon emissions. We help developers and organizations make low-carbon architecture decisions and provide best practices to improve sustainability.\nDevelopers at companies such as L\u2019O r\u00e9al  and SAP  are \nusing Google Cloud tools to reduce the emissions \nassociated with their technology footprint. Working closely with these customers, we developed our Carbon Footprint  product\u2014a freely available tool that provides \nmonthly emissions data on a per service, project, and region basis. The data can be accessed in BigQuery for analysis and can be easily integrated with popular carbon accounting tools. Carbon Footprint data is also integrated with recommendations  to reduce emissions.Climate risk and resilience\nMany of our commercial customers are eager to assess and improve their resilience to climate change. From transportation companies to financial service organizations, Google is helping organizations integrate climate data and geospatial analysis into business strategy and risk management. For example, we partnered with RSMetrics and Infosys to publish a design pattern for portfolio climate risk analysis and we\u2019re helping insurers boost responses to disaster-related claims .\nWe\u2019ve launched SpatiaFi , together with our partner \nClimate Engine, to help the banking sector harness the power of geospatial analytics to support climate finance. For example, geospatial data can help a bank\u2019s agriculture customers build a personalized picture of flood and drought risks and biodiversity at a field-specific level.\nResponsible sourcing\nAs global demand for raw materials continues to grow, deforestation is increasing, contributing to GHG emissions. Companies want to know more about the origins of their raw materials, including which are sourced responsibly\u2014and how they can improve their sourcing practices.\nGoogle Cloud, in partnership with NGIS (a geospatial \nsolutions company) is helping brands gain a deeper understanding of sustainable sourcing practices  across \nsupplier networks. By combining the power of our cloud computing, AI, and geospatial analytics, we\u2019re helping companies get real-time, reliable information into operations at a local supplier level, globally. For example, we\u2019re helping Unilever build a more holistic view of the forests, water cycles, and biodiversity that intersect its supply chain. We also helped launch TraceMark , a \nGoogle Cloud Ready \u2013 Sustainability Solution designed for enterprises, which aims to accelerate the delivery of traceability and transparency in global supply chains for raw materials.\nTransportation-related \nemissions\nWe\u2019re working with a number of commercial organizations \nto tackle transportation-related emissions. Ecommerce shipments are on track to double by 2026,\n\u200960 and 90% of \nU.S. consumers expect free two-to-three-day shipping,\u200961 \nso we\u2019re helping businesses optimize every stage of the last mile delivery journey: capturing valid addresses, optimizing delivery routes, efficiently navigating drivers, tracking shipment progress, and analyzing fleet performance. We\u2019re also helping organizations harness the power of data and AI to drive more intelligent logistics operations  and supply chains. For example, our customer \nEV Suitability Assessment helps organizations monitor their fleet of vehicles and make choices that minimize environmental impact.\nData analytics tools from Google Cloud are also helping \nairlines. Lufthansa Group partnered with Google Cloud \nand Google Research to develop a platform that facilitates better planning and management of daily flight operations.\nWe\u2019re helping organizations harness \nthe power of data and AI to drive more intelligent supply chains.Renewable energy\nWind farms are an important source of carbon-free electricity, but wind can fluctuate depending on the weather. Through Google Cloud, customers like Engie  (a global energy and renewables supplier) can optimize their wind portfolio in short-term power markets by predicting wind power output 36 hours ahead of actual generation  and making optimal hourly delivery \ncommitments to the grid, a full day in advance.  \nSustainability partner \nsolutions\nPartner solutions are important to scale the impact for our \ncustomers and help them get the support they need, from processing ESG data to reducing carbon emissions. This is why we launched Google Cloud Ready \u2013 Sustainability, a designation to validate and promote sustainability partner solutions built on Google Cloud.\nGreat Western wind farm in Oklahoma \n(225 MW for G\noogle)   26\n2023 Environmental Report  Researchers, academics, \nand NGOs\nWe\u2019re providing cutting-edge climate- and nature-related \ndata and analytics to scientific researchers from academic institutions and NGOs. This support is enabling advances in the most complex areas of their fields, applying AI, machine learning, and geospatial analytics at a global scale to accelerate the shift to a sustainable future.   \nPlanetary-scale platforms\nLaunched in 2010, Google Earth Engine is Google\u2019s planetary-scale platform for Earth science data and analysis. It offers over 1,000 Earth observation datasets with powerful cloud computing to show timely, accurate, high-resolution insights about the state of the world\u2019s habitats and ecosystems\u2014and how they\u2019re changing over time.\nScientists, researchers, and developers have been using \nEarth Engine for more than a decade to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth\u2019s surface. In 2022, over 90,000 users regularly used Earth Engine\u2019s data analytics and computing for research and educational purposes. Multiple global conservation and restoration tools have also been built on the platform. For example, founded by Crowther Lab in Zurich and powered by Google Earth Engine and Google Cloud, Restor  allows anyone to analyze \nthe restoration potential of any place on Earth. When you outline a given area on the Restor map, it will show you data on local biodiversity, the current and potential amount of solid carbon stored in the soil, land cover, soil pH, and annual rainfall. With this information, the platform connects practitioners, facilitates the exchange of information, and makes projects visible to potential funders and the public.In 2022, researchers addressed urban climate change inequities  using publicly available data from Earth Engine. \nThis study used Earth Engine to combine medium-to-high-resolution satellite observations with census data to calculate the feasible area available for planting new trees in urban areas for over 200 areas in California.\n\u200962 By quantifying this, \nthey were able to provide estimates of several co-benefit  \nof tree cover . \nTo accelerate the innovation that we\u2019ve seen from the scientific and NGO communities, we\u2019re now bringing Google Earth Engine to public and private sector users.  In 2022, we expanded Google Earth Engine\u2019s availability for commercial use by businesses and governments worldwide as an enterprise-grade service through Google Cloud.  With access to reliable, up-to-date insights on how our planet is changing, organizations will be better equipped  to move their sustainability efforts forward.\nGoogle Earth\nOur planet has seen rapid environmental change in the past half-century\u2014more than at any other point in human history.\nTimelapse  in Google Earth is a global, zoomable  \ntime-lapse video of the planet, providing a clearer picture \nof Earth\u2019s dynamic change since 1984\u2014not just problems,  but also solutions, as well as beautiful natural phenomena that unfold over decades\u2014from irrigation systems emerging in the deserts of Egypt to volcanic eruptions, logging, and wildfires changing the landscape of California\u2019s Lassen National Forest  and glaciers retreating  \nin Sermersooq, Greenland  (see Figure 9). \nThe imagery also captures how cities have adapted to combat climate change\u2014like offshore wind farms in Middelgrunden, Denmark  and a large-scale solar \ninstallation in Granada, Spain .FIGURE 9\nGlacier retreat in Sermersooq, Greenland, seen from Timelapse in Google Earth. \n1984\n2022   27\n2023 Environmental Report  Data Commons\nSustainability data is fragmented across thousands of silos, \nin many formats and schemas, and across a multitude of databases. In 2017, we started the Data Commons  \nproject, which aggregates data from a wide range of sources into a unified database to make it more accessible and useful . Data Commons was developed by Google to \norganize sustainability data from hundreds of sources , \nsuch as the World Bank, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It makes this data available to researchers, journalists, policymakers, individuals, and other stakeholders around the globe.\nToday, Data Commons is one of the world\u2019s largest \nknowledge graphs on sustainability, including data about climate, health, food, crops, shelter, emissions, and more. Anyone can access, explore, and understand this data using Google Search or our free dashboards and visualization tools, and they can use our open and free APIs to build new tools based on this data. For enterprise customers, this data is available via Data Commons on the BigQuery Analytics Hub.\nData Commons is being used to monitor and address a \nvariety of sustainability challenges, including climate change, natural disasters, water quality, and food security.\nClimate change\nData Commons can ingest health data from the CDC and climate data from the IPCC, and combine them by aligning data on location, health conditions, or dates. A policymaker can then use Data Commons to compare these two datasets to identify outliers and understand how temperature changes may affect populations with pre-existing conditions .Natural disasters\nPartnering with the John Doerr School of Climate at Stanford, Data Commons has helped Stanford create a climate disaster dashboard  to identify areas affected \nby wildfires, wet bulb temperatures, and other natural disasters exacerbated by climate change. The Data Commons team was able to take numerous climate models and model probabilities for future temperature ranges in specific areas.\nWater quality\nData Commons is helping communities get a better understanding of water use, quality, and availability. For example, a researcher at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras is working with Data Commons  to add India-based \ndata on water quality.\nFood security\nFeeding America is a nationwide network of 200 member food banks serving tens of millions of people in need in the United States. Data from their annual Map the Meal Gap study is accessible in Feeding America Data Commons , so \nanyone can explore food security and how it intersects with variables like health, climate, and education. For example, it shows that counties that will be most affected by climate change are also already most affected by food scarcity . \nThis data allows Feeding America to quickly identify U.S. locations where food insecurity is most exacerbated by other root causes of disparities and hardship.\nNonprofit TechSoup  used Data Commons to identify how \nclimate change will impact food security needs in California. \nThis allowed them to see that agricultural counties that will be most impacted by temperature changes are already at the highest levels of food insecurity. They can then map out specific food support sites to see which counties will need more civil society organizations helping with food insecurity.\nWildlife monitoring\nIn 2022, global search interest in     \u201cwildlife \u201d   nearly \ntripled,\u200963 reaching a 15-year high.\u200964 We\u2019re using our \ntechnology to support wildlife conservation efforts around the world. TerrAdapt  uses satellite monitoring technology \npowered by Google Earth Engine to project habitat conditions given future climate and land-use scenarios. TerrAdapt can help prioritize areas  for conservation \nactions\u2014like habitat restoration, increasing protection status, and building wildlife crossings.\nGoogle teamed up with the Commonwealth Scientific \nand Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO\u2014Australia\u2019s national science agency) and the Kaggle data science community to protect coral reefs including Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef, the world\u2019s biggest coral reef system. We developed a machine learning solution to analyze underwater images  of a species of starfish that feed \non living coral. By detecting them more accurately and efficiently, scientists can now more easily monitor the reef and manage the impact of the starfish more effectively. In collaboration with CSIRO and other partners, we\u2019re also applying AI to measure carbon sequestration  capacity of \nseagrass ecosystems.\nSince 2017, Google has been a founding technology \npartner in Wildlife Insights \u2014a collaboration between \nseven leading conservation organizations to streamline biodiversity monitoring  with the help of AI and to fill critical \ndata gaps to inform data-driven decisions. This platform makes it easier for conservationists and scientists to collect and analyze data from remote cameras.We\u2019re working with partners to leverage \nmachine learning to monitor and protect wildlife habitats, such as coral reefs.\nWildlife Insights helps conservationists protect species from extinction with AI.   28\n2023 Environmental Report  Investing in breakthrough innovation\nWe\u2019re helping advance the next generation of audacious \ntechnologies to address sustainability challenges. Incubating breakthrough technologies is essential for  the transformative change needed to deliver deep emissions reductions at scale and to bend the curve  of climate change.\nAnd at X, Alphabet\u2019s \u201cmoonshot factory ,\u201d our teams are \ndeveloping cutting-edge technology that aims to solve \nproblems for millions of people and change systems worldwide. Climate-related projects comprise more than half of X\u2019s current moonshots, which include experiments in ocean health, carbon sequestration, clean energy, wildfire awareness, waste reduction, and sustainable agriculture. X is using what they\u2019ve learned from a decade of climate projects to shape the work they\u2019re doing now. \nClean electricity\nTapestry  aims to unlock access to clean, reliable, and \naffordable electricity worldwide by providing greater insight into our increasingly dynamic and complex electricity system. As X\u2019s moonshot for the electric grid , \nit\u2019s creating a single virtualized view of the electricity system that can predict and simulate what might happen on the grid from nanoseconds to decades into the future. Insights from such computational models can lead to reduced energy consumption, lower emissions, and improved resilience to outages, as well as reduce interconnection queues, enabling more renewable energy capacity to be added to the grid.Ocean ecosystems\nTidal  is X\u2019s moonshot to protect the ocean with \ntechnology systems while feeding humanity sustainably. Its underwater sensor system and machine perception tools are bringing visibility to our ocean ecosystems so we can better understand and protect them while sustainably harnessing the ocean to solve some of humanity\u2019s biggest challenges\u2014from food production to climate change. \nTidal\u2019s first product monitors fish and environmental \nconditions underwater to detect and interpret things like fish behaviors, which are helpful for feeding and health tracking, and predict outcomes such as growth trends over time\u2014all of which can help fish farmers make better, more environmentally-friendly and cost-effective decisions about fish feeding, welfare, and health.\nAutonomous driving\nWaymo\u2019s  mission is to make it safe and easy for people \nand things to get where they\u2019re going. Waymo\u2019s fleet of shared electric vehicles provides a fully autonomous ride-hailing service in Phoenix and San Francisco, connecting communities with the benefits of EVs. Waymo\u2019s EV fleet is also matched with 100% renewable electricity.Sustainable food \nsystems\nIncreasing agricultural productivity and sustainability \nis imperative to feed the planet\u2019s growing population. Modern agriculture has a significant environmental impact, such as soil degradation and biodiversity loss due to weeds, pests, diseases, herbicide resistance, and excess chemical input waste.

We set ambitious sustainability goals . We share the \ninnovations we create and the lessons we learn with others, so we can help accelerate the global transition to a low-carbon and sustainable future.\nWe\u2019re working to drive sustainability across our operations \nin four key ways: accelerating the transition to a net-zero carbon future, advancing water stewardship, building a circular economy, and protecting nature and biodiversity.Our \noperations\nGoogle uses energy, natural resources, and products \nand services to build our workplaces, data centers, and consumer hardware products. At the end of 2022, we had offices and data centers in roughly 200 cities  and nearly \n60 countries  around the world. We also had two retail \nstores, both in New York City.\nThe products and services that our customers and users \nrely on\u2014like Gmail, Google Cloud, Search, and YouTube\u2014are powered by our data centers and networking infrastructure. At the end of 2022, we had 28 Google-owned and -operated data center campuses across 24 data center locations\n\u200965 on four continents, as well as more \nthan 30 Google Cloud regions . In addition to our Google-\nowned and -operated data centers, we use additional third-party-operated data centers as well.\nWe work worldwide with suppliers that support \nour business and operations, including hardware manufacturing and indirect services. Through our Supplier\u00a0Responsibility program , we collaborate with \nstakeholders across our supply chain to uphold our high standards for protecting workers and the environment.\nGoogle\u2019s data center in St. Ghislain, Belgium.    33\n2023 Environmental Report  Net-zero \ncarbon\nWe aim to achieve net-zero \nemissions across all of our operations and value chain  by 2030Our ambition\nOur approach\nMeasuring our carbon \nfootprint\nReducing carbon emissionsAdvancing carbon-free energyManaging residual emissions\nThe journey ahead\nOur ambition\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change is unequivocal: climate change is an urgent threat to human well-being and the health of the planet.\n\u200966 \nWhile the last several years have seen significant progress in mobilizing the global community to take more ambitious climate action, the world isn\u2019t on track to meet the targets established by the Paris Agreement to limit temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\u200967 \nAt Google, we\u2019re working to accelerate the transition to a \ncarbon-free future. We know that our responsibility begins with our own carbon footprint, which is why we\u2019ve taken significant steps over the past two decades to minimize our own emissions. In 2021, we set our most ambitious goal yet: to achieve net-zero emissions  across all of our operations \nand value chain by 2030. To accomplish this, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 absolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We\u2019ve formally committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target.\nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our \noperations is transitioning to clean energy. Energy use contributes to a significant share of our carbon footprint due to the electricity needs of our operations\u2014in particular, our data centers. That\u2019s why, in 2020, we set a goal to operate our data centers and office campuses on 24/7 carbon-free energy  on every grid where we operate by \n2030 (24/7 CFE). We\u2019ve been working hard to transition our operations and the electricity grids that serve us to cleaner sources of power, through a combination of clean energy procurement, technology innovation, and policy advocacy. And we expect our work to decarbonize electricity grids where we operate to contribute to decarbonization across our value chain as well.\nCharting our path\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals\u2014what we call \u201cmoonshots.\u201d We also know that our path to net-zero emissions won\u2019t be easy or linear; it may require us to navigate significant uncertainty and deploy new systems and technologies across our business. Some of our plans will take years to deliver their full results, particularly where they involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we expect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.\nIn our third decade of climate action , we recognize that \nwe can\u2019t achieve our goals alone. Transitioning to a carbon-\nfree future will require stronger government policies and partnerships with many other organizations, as well as new technologies and structural changes to the broader systems that serve our operations and value chain,  \nsuch as electricity grids and hardware supply chains.   34\n2023 Environmental Report  It will be especially critical for governments around the \nworld to enact policies that drive rapid technological and economic transformations, including the full decarbonization of the global energy system. That\u2019s why Google advocates for stronger clean energy and climate policies, and partners with many other organizations to accelerate clean energy and climate progress. We\u2019ve played instrumental roles in setting up advocacy organizations, including the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA) in the United States, the RE-Source Platform in Europe, and the Asia Clean Energy Coalition (ACEC). \nTo learn more about our public policy and advocacy, \nincluding policy engagement, trade associations, memberships, and partnerships, see the Governance  \nand Engagement  section.\nChallenges to address\nWhile we\u2019re excited about our net-zero emissions journey, we recognize that we face many challenges. For example:\nGrowing energy needs\n\u2022 As we work towards our absolute 50% emissions reduction target, our business is continuing to evolve to meet the needs of a rapidly digitalizing world, and to harness the opportunities presented by  AI technology.\n\u2022 Our operations and value chain are global and involve a diverse range of industries, which means we must make progress within hard-to-abate sectors and carbon-intensive geographies, such as the Asia Pacific region. \n\u2022 We have a large number of different suppliers, both direct and indirect, each with climate programs that differ widely in maturity. In some cases, this limits our ability to successfully influence them, and to collect the data needed to accurately estimate our  Scope 3 emissions.\nAvailability of carbon-free energy\n\u2022 There are often long lead times between our investments and resulting GHG reductions. For example, with new wind and solar projects, it can take years before projects that we contract are constructed and begin to generate clean electricity. \n\u2022 System-level decarbonization is proceeding more slowly than needed in many regions and sectors, and while we aim to accelerate these changes through our efforts and engagement, they aren\u2019t within our control.\nUse of carbon removals\n\u2022 Because the carbon removals sector is in the earliest stage of development, costs are currently high, and there are limited volumes of removals available for purchase.\n\u200968\nAs we move towards our net-zero goal, the scale of these challenges will only increase, along with the difficulty of additional progress. We believe that the urgency of climate change demands immediate action, and setting ambitious, near-term targets is a valuable way to focus our efforts and drive important progress across the energy systems and value chains in which we operate.\nNorther Offshore wind farm in Belgium (92 MW for Google)\nOur approach\nOur core business involves using data to solve hard problems, and our unique strength is combining engineering skills with an innovative mindset and a global reach.\nThere are three main focus areas that make up our approach to our net-zero goal: reducing emissions across our operations and value chain, advancing carbon-free energy, and addressing our residual emissions with carbon removals (see Figure 10).\nFIGURE 10 Our net-zero approach\nCarbon reduction\nReduce emissions across our \noperations and value chainCarbon-free energy\nAdvance carbon-free energy across \nour operations and value chain Carbon removals\nAddress our residual emissions  \nwith carbon removals   35\n2023 Environmental Report  Measuring our carbon footprint\nWe began calculating our annual carbon footprint in 2006. \nEvery year since 2009, we\u2019ve publicly reported the results to CDP , a global organization that asks companies to \ndisclose information on their GHG emissions performance and management.\nIn 2022, our total GHG emissions were approximately  \n10.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO\n2e), which represents our Scope 1, Scope 2  \n(market-based), and Scope 3 emissions. In 2022, our total operational emissions were approximately 2.9 million tCO\n2e, where operational emissions represent Scope 1 \nand Scope 2 (market-based) emissions, as well as Scope 3 emissions from business travel and employee commuting, including teleworking (see Figure 11).FIGURE 11\nOur carbon footprint\nScope 1:\n91K tCO2e\nScope 3 (total):7.6M tCO\n2eScope 2 (market-based):2.5M tCO\n2eTotal emissions:\n10.2M tCO2e\nOperational\nemissions:\n2.95M tCO2e\nScope \nScope 1 \nScope 2Scope 3Scope 3Scope 3Scope 3Scope 3 Scope 3\nTotal emissions 10,183,400 100%(market-based)Business travelEmployee commuting (including teleworking)Capital goodsUpstream transportation and distributionOther categories(total)91,200\n2,492,200\n211,000\n151,000\n2,096,000\n556,000\n4,586,000\n7 ,600,0001%\n24%\n2%2%\n21%\n5%\n45%\n75%tCO\n2e %Scope 1 emissions\nScope 1 emissions represent 1% of our carbon \nfootprint.  Our main sources of Scope 1 emissions include \ntransportation (company vehicles and aircraft), fuel use from back-up generators, natural gas use, and refrigerant leakage in our data centers and offices.\nScope 2 emissions\nScope 2 (market-based) emissions represent 24% of our carbon footprint, mainly due to the electricity demands of our data centers. Scope 2 emissions are thus a key focus of our decarbonization efforts, given that we have more direct control over our data centers than many other parts of our value chain. For over a decade, we\u2019ve procured clean energy to reduce the carbon emissions from our electricity use: our Scope 2 (location-based) emissions, which don\u2019t take into account our renewable energy procurement through power purchase agreements (PPAs), represent 51% of our carbon footprint, demonstrating the dramatic emissions reductions that we\u2019ve achieved through PPAs.\nScope 3 emissions\nOur Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from other sources in our value chain, such as our suppliers, use of our consumer hardware products, and business travel. The majority of these emissions come from upstream manufacturing of consumer hardware products, the production of capital goods we have purchased for use in our data centers, and data center construction. After accounting for the impact of renewable energy procurement through PPAs, Scope 3 emissions represent 75% of our carbon footprint.\nFor more information on our GHG emissions, see the \nReporting approach and methodology  section and our \nEnvironmental data tables .   36\n2023 Environmental Report  Reducing carbon emissions\nWe\u2019re working to reduce our emissions across our \noperations and value chain. Key efforts include energy-efficient and low-carbon facilities, electrification, sustainable travel and commuting, and supplier engagement. \nClean energy is also critical to reducing emissions across \nour value chain. Procuring carbon-free energy has a significant impact on reducing our Scope 2 emissions by eliminating emissions associated with our electricity use. In addition, a significant share of our Scope 3 emissions can be traced back to the electricity grids that power our suppliers and users, so accelerating the decarbonization of electricity grids is also key to our net-zero goal. For more information, see the Carbon-free energy  section.\nTARGET\nReduce 50% of our \ncombined Scope 1, 2 (market-based), and 3 absolute GHG emissions before 20302022 PROGRESS\nTotal GHG emissions: 10.2 million tCO\n2e*\n*Due to a methodology change, we\u2019re not reporting\na percent progress towards this target for 2022\nDETAILS\nYear set: 2021    |    Base year: 2019    |    Target year: before 2030Scope: Percent reduction in combined Scope 1, 2 (market-based), and 3 absolute emissions across our operations and value chain, when compared to a 2019 base year. This represents our operations and value chain, including consumer hardware products.Our emissions reduction \ngoal\nIn 2022, our total GHG emissions were approximately \n10.2 million tCO2e. We revised our Scope 3 methodology \nto calculate upstream emissions related to consumer hardware manufacturing by moving away from using a spend-based methodology to a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)-based methodology. \nWe also made improvements to the quality of data used \nto estimate our emissions associated with manufacturing our data center hardware, as well as the LCAs and LCA emission factors used to calculate emissions related to data center construction. \nThese changes are reflected in our reported Scope \n3 emissions for fiscal year 2022, but not for the prior years. Had we not made these changes, we estimate that our reported Scope 3 emissions would have been approximately 18% higher, remaining relatively flat when compared to the prior year (see Figure 12).\nOur Scope 2 (market-based) emissions increased by \n37%, primarily due to increased data center electricity consumption and a lack of full regional coverage of renewable energy procurement in the United States  and Asia Pacific regions.In 2022, we reported Scope 2 (location-based) emissions of 8.0 million tCO\n2e, which doesn\u2019t take into account our \nrenewable energy procurement, and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions of 2.5 million tCO\n2e. This means that \nthrough our PPAs, in 2022, we achieved a 69% reduction in our emissions from our electricity use (see Figure 17).\nSince 2011, our carbon intensity per unit of revenue has \ndecreased by 76% while our business grew significantly over the same period.\n\u200969 We continue working to lower  \nthe correlation between our business growth and our GHG emissions.\nFIGURE 12\nAnnual emissions\n20M\n10M\n(in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent [tCO2e])12,528,000\n16,850,6002019\n15,275,80010,322,1002020\n16,124,30011,371,2002021\n15,736,60010,183,4002022Base yearScope 3 \nmethodology \nchangeLegend\nTotal emissions\nBusiness as usual (footprint in absence of PPAs)\nEstimated difference in 2022 total emissions  \ndue to Scope 3 methodology update\nIn 2022, our reported total GHG emissions decreased \ndue to i m\nprovements we made to our Scope 3 \naccounting methodology , which we haven\u2019t yet \napplied to prior years. \nHad we not made these methodology changes,  \nwe estimate that our reported 2022 Scope 3 emissions \nwould have been approximately 18% higher, remaining \nrelatively flat when compared to 2021 .   37\n2023 Environmental Report  Energy-efficient and \nlow-car\nbon facilities\nWe pursue a set of integrated strategies to reduce \nthe carbon footprint of our facilities, including energy efficiency, building and fleet electrification, on-site generation of clean energy, and carbon-free energy procurement. Reducing waste is another strategy,  which is covered in the Circular economy  section.\nWhen designing our data centers and offices, we consider options to reduce their carbon impacts, such as the incorporation of low-GHG materials and adaptive reuse of existing buildings. For example, in Sunnyvale, California, we\u2019re building our first ground-up mass timber building , which is projected to have 96% fewer embodied carbon emissions than an equivalent steel and concrete structure, factoring in sequestration.\n\u200970\nPreventing refrigerants from leaking and finding low-global warming potential (GWP) alternatives is critical for reducing global emissions.\n\u200971 We\u2019re taking steps to more \naccurately measure refrigerant leak rates and working to develop new technology solutions that can prevent emissions from these leaks. For example, at our data centers, we\u2019re developing and deploying cooling solutions that include natural, low-GWP refrigerants .\nGoogle is a founding member of the iMasons Climate Accord , an industry coalition working to reduce GHG \nemissions across the technical infrastructure systems that support the digital economy. As a part of this effort, we\u2019re collaborating with industry peers to highlight the importance of low-GHG construction materials, such as greener concrete , and to accelerate progress in the \ndevelopment and deployment of these materials.\nIn 2022, we filed a patent for using machine \nlearning technology to improve our ability to prevent emissions from refrigerant leaks.\nData centers\nGoogle\u2019s data centers are the engine of our company, powering products like Gmail, Google Cloud, Search, and YouTube for billions of people around the world. We\u2019ve worked to make Google\u2019s data centers some of the most efficient in the world, improving their environmental performance even as demand for our products has risen. We\u2019ve done this by designing, building, and operating each one to maximize efficient use of energy, water, \nand ma\nterials.\nOur long-standing data center efficiency  efforts are \nimportant because our data centers represent the vast majority of our direct electricity use. To reduce their energy use, we strive to build the world\u2019s most energy-efficient computing network, outfitting each data center with high-performance servers that we\u2019ve custom-designed to use as little energy as possible. For example, our tensor processing unit v4 has enabled us to train machine learning algorithms with industry-leading efficiency , resulting in significant \nemissions reductions compared to business as usual.\n\u200972 \nWe also install smart temperature and lighting controls , \nredesign how power is distributed to reduce energy loss, and employ advanced cooling techniques,  including \nenergy-efficient evaporative cooling.\nAt some sites, we also recapture heat generated by our \nservers and use it to heat our data center office spaces and other on-site facilities. We continue to assess opportunities\n2022 HIGHLIGHT\nCompared with five years ago, we  \nnow deliver approximately three times as much computing power with the same amount of electrical power.\n\u200973 \nA visualization of the roof of our landmark Platform G office development in King\u2019s Cross, London.   38\n2023 Environmental Report  for off-site heat recovery, where environmentally sound \nand technically feasible, considering the remote location of many of our data centers and the infrastructure required. Heat recovery is also a key part of our office development strategy, as well as one of the main levers to help us electrify\u2014because reusing heat often requires less energy than creating new heat.\nOur efforts have paid off. On average, a Google-owned \nand -operated data center is more than 1.5 times as energy efficient  as a typical enterprise data center\n\u200974 and, \ncompared with five years ago, we now deliver approximately three times as much computing power with the same amount of electrical power.\n\u200975 In 2022, the average annual \npower usage effectiveness (PUE)\u200976 for our global fleet of \ndata centers was 1.10, compared with the industry average of 1.55\n\u200977\u2014meaning that Google data centers use about 5.5 \ntimes less overhead energy for every unit of IT equipment energy. Since 2012, our average annual fleet-wide PUE has stayed at or below 1.12 (see Figure 13).\nIn 2022, we maintained our ISO 50001 certification for all \nGoogle-owned and -operated data centers in Europe that met our operational threshold for power usage. We were the first major internet company to achieve a multi-site energy management system certification to ISO 50001, which we first obtained in 2013.\n2022 HIGHLIGHT\nOn average, a Google-owned and \n-operated data center is more than1.5 times as energy efficient as atypical enterprise data center.\n\u200978Historically, research  has shown that as AI/ML compute \ndemand has gone up, the energy needed to power this \ntechnology has increased at a much slower rate than many forecasts predicted. We have used tested practices to reduce the carbon footprint of workloads by large \nmargins; together these principles have reduced the energy of training a model by up to 100x and emissions by up to 1,000x.

Of our LEED-certified square footage, 27% has achieved a Platinum rating, and 60% a Gold rating. \nAs we work to improve performance across our existing \nportfolio, we use energy management strategies, building optimization, and data analytics to help drive efficiency measures like equipment upgrades, setpoint adjustments, and lighting retrofits. 2022 HIGHLIGHT\nAs of 2022, over 1.8 million square \nmeters (nearly 20 million square feet) of Google office facilities have achieved LEED certification.\nWe received the highest LEED certification for our Google \nstore in New York City\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood.   39\n2023 Environmental Report  FIGURE 14\nExamples of energy- and carbon-efficient Google offices\n1105 Peachtree  \nin Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A.\nIn 2022, we opened our 1105 Peachtree office, which is designed to  \nmeet LEED v4 Gold Certification. To promote low-carbon commutes,  it\u2019s located near mass transit and offers on-site bike parking. It also includes smart building technology throughout to decrease energy use.\n6 Pancras Square  \nin London, U.K.\nOur 6 Pancras Square office was the first building project in the world to receive ILFI Zero Carbon Certification . It\u2019s also certified LEED v2009 \nPlatinum and received a BREEAM Excellent rating.\nEnergy audits  \nin Asia-Pacific\nIn 2022, we conducted more than 20 energy audits across our largest \nAsia Pacific sites. As a result, we identified more than 200 energy conservation measures that we\u2019re now actively implementing\u2014which are projected to save a total of 5,600 MWh of energy.   40\n2023 Environmental Report  Electrification at our\u00a0offices\nElectrification\u2014which helps enable transitioning away \nfrom fossil fuels\u2014is an essential first step toward decarbonizing our operations, followed by 24/7 CFE procurement. We\u2019re exploring opportunities to electrify our facilities , from retrofitting existing building \nsystems, to including electrification standards for new development, to working with landlords on electrification-friendly leases for buildings we don\u2019t own.\nWe\u2019ve been piloting technologies to enable building \nelectrification since 2010. For example, our first all-electric office\u20141842 North Shoreline in Mountain View, California\u2014has been in operation for over a decade. Many of these pilots led us to confidently implement new technology in our large development projects. In 2022, we advanced a comprehensive plan to electrify systems across our building portfolio. \nMore recently, in 2022, we opened Bay View\u2014an all-\nelectric campus with an innovative geothermal installation and the largest electric kitchen in our global portfolio. Learn more in our Bay View spotlight . \nWe\u2019re also working to eliminate use of natural gas by designing all-electric kitchens at our offices, including in the Bay Area, Europe, and Latin America. \n2022 HIGHLIGHT\nIn 2022, we opened Bay View\u2014an all-\nelectric campus.Sustainable travel \nand\u00a0commuting\nOur transportation team plans, implements, and operates \nsustainable commuting options that help Googlers get to work by riding shuttles, carpooling, taking public transit, biking, or walking. \nWe have a growing number of electric vehicles  in \nour corporate fleet, and the majority of our global fuel \nconsumption from non-electric vehicles is renewable diesel. We strive to provide electric vehicle charging stations for 10% of the total parking spaces at our Bay Area headquarters, and we continue to work toward this design standard for new development projects. \nTo date, we\u2019ve installed more than 5,000 electric vehicle \ncharging ports at our offices. We estimate that employee EV commuting in the United States and Canada prevented roughly 12,000 tCO\n2e emissions in 2022.\u200980 \nMany campuses offer commuter shuttles  to reduce \nindividual vehicle trips. In 2022, we launched an  expansion of our all-electric buses for the Bay Area and are introducing these throughout 2023 to replace our existing fleet. For 2022, our shuttle buses in the Bay Area produced savings of more than 10,000 tCO\n2e emissions\u2014\nthe equivalent of avoiding more than 41 million vehicle km (25 million vehicle miles) or taking on average more than 2,000 cars off the road for a\u00a0year.\n\u2009812022 HIGHLIGHT\nGoogle shuttle buses in the Bay Area \nproduced savings of more than 10,000 tCO\n2e emissions\u2014the equivalent of \ntaking on average more than 2,000 cars off the road for a year.\n\u200982 \nSupplier engagement\nWe work with many suppliers that are committed to \nsustainability, and we\u2019re partnering with them to develop decarbonization roadmaps and build essential data infrastructure to accurately quantify emissions and reductions across the value chain.\nWe engage with our suppliers\u2014including hardware \nmanufacturing and indirect services suppliers\u2014to help reduce their energy consumption and GHG emissions, as stated in our Supplier Code of Conduct , which all \nsuppliers are required to sign. We assess suppliers\u2019 practices to report, manage, and reduce their emissions and incorporate this into our supplier scorecard.\nReporting  \nenvironmental data\nWe expect all our suppliers to report environmental data, \nand we encourage them to respond to CDP\u2019s Climate Change survey. In 2022, we invited 222 suppliers to participate, and at least 90% of our hardware suppliers, by spend, provided data. Our supplier data is used to help set goals and priorities for our sustainability program and we continue to refine our data quality and methodology for calculating the carbon footprint associated with the manufacturing of our hardware products throughout their life cycle.\nIn 2022, in addition to our CDP supply chain disclosure \nrequests, we engaged with suppliers directly to drive improved data and accounting, including increased completeness and accuracy for their Scope 1, 2, and  3 emissions.\nDeveloping roadmaps to \nreduce emissions\nSince setting our net-zero emissions goal, we\u2019ve engaged \nour key suppliers to develop roadmaps to reduce emissions across our supply chain. During Google\u2019s 2022 Supplier Sustainability Summit, we communicated the expectation for suppliers to publicly set targets to reduce GHG emissions. We provide in-depth training for key suppliers on setting ambitious GHG reduction and renewable electricity targets. For suppliers that completed our CDP supply chain survey, 75% reported having GHG emissions reduction targets, and of those suppliers, 36% reported that their target is science-based. We aim to accelerate our suppliers\u2019 GHG emissions reductions through further integration of climate performance into key procurement tools and the development of new mechanisms to drive deep supplier decarbonization.   41\n2023 Environmental Report  Advancing carbon-free energy\nOur primary approach for reducing our Scope 2 emissions \nis through the procurement of carbon-free energy.\u200983 Since \n2017, we\u2019ve matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an annual basis.\n\u200984 \nHowever, because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind across the regions where we operate\u2014and because of the variable supply of these resources\u2014we still need to rely on carbon-emitting energy sources that power local grids (see Figure 15). That\u2019s why, in 2020, we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where we operate by 2030, aiming to procure clean energy to meet our electricity needs, every hour of every day, within every grid where we operate. Achieving this will also increase the impact of our clean energy procurement on the decarbonization of the grids that serve us.\n\u200985We\u2019re working to achieve 24/7 CFE through three main initiatives: purchasing carbon-free energy , accelerating \nnew and improved technologies , and transforming the \nenergy system  through partnerships and advocacy.\nFIGURE 15\nHourly carbon-free energy performance at an example data center\nWhile Google buys large amounts of wind and solar power (symbolized by green spikes \nbelow), these resources are variable, meaning that our data centers still sometimes rely on carbon-based resources. \nData \ncenter\nelectricity\ndemandJanuary 1 December 31Legend\nGaps in carbon-free energy\nCarbon-free energy supplyPurchasing  \ncarbon-free energy\nAchieving 24/7 CFE is far more complex and technically \nchallenging than annually matching our energy use with renewable energy purchases.

But we see our efforts as part of a bigger picture, and we\u2019ve set this ambitious goal to help scale new, global solutions. We\u2019re excited to see others\u2014like the U.S. federal government \u2014set similar goals as well.Renewable energy \nprocurement\nWe buy electricity directly from new wind and solar farms \nvia long-term PPAs on the grids where we operate, and we also buy renewable power through utilities via renewable energy purchasing models that we helped create.\nFrom 2010 to 2022, we signed more than 80 agreements \ntotaling approximately 10 GW of clean energy generation capacity\u2014the equivalent of more than  31 million solar panels. Through these agreements, we estimate we\u2019ll spend approximately $10 billion to purchase clean energy through 2040.\n\u200986 \nIn 2022, we signed contracts for approximately 2.8 GW of clean energy capacity\u2014more than in any prior year. This included two new projects in the U.K. and Spain, our first in each country, that will help our Cloud regions and offices move closer to 24/7 CFE.\n2022 HIGHLIGHT\nFrom 2010 to 2022, we signed \nmore than 80 agreements totaling approximately 10 GW of clean energy generation capacity.

Without this change in methodology, CFE for Google-owned and -operated data centers would have remained relatively flat year-over-year.\nOur total electricity load across all data center facilities \nincreased by roughly 3 TWh (18%) from 2021 to 2022, while our contracted CFE\n\u200991 increased by roughly 2 TWh (17%). \nDespite this significant expansion of carbon-free energy supply, the percentage of our energy use that came from carbon-free sources remained relatively flat because of the significant growth in our total electricity load.\nBeyond the challenge of growing our CFE  \nprocurement  to keep up with our growing power \ndemand, last year we also faced headwinds that made it more challenging to purchase CFE\u2014including continued disruptions to renewable energy supply chains, delays for interconnecting new utility-scale projects, and increased demand for clean energy projects. Adding to these difficulties, load growth continued in regions where CFE contracting is especially difficult given local market dynamics and resource availability constraints (such as the PJM [Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland] grid region in the eastern United States and certain Asia Pacific  grid regions).\nDespite these significant headwinds, we\u2019re proud of the \nprogress we were able to make across many of our data center facilities. Seven of our 41 grid regions achieved \nat lea\nst 90% CFE , and 13 achieved at least 85% CFE  \n(see Figure 18). These 13 grid regions span North America, \nLati\nn America, and Europe. \nWhile load grew significantly within the central United States, our CFE procurement in this region kept pace\u2014keeping the Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool among our highest-scoring grid regions. We increased our contracted CFE in the  U.K., Finland, and Germany.\nTo see more data regarding CFE by region, see the \nEnvironmental data table . \nOffices\nFor our offices, which represent a small portion of our global CFE score, we achieved approximately 56%  round-\nthe-clock carbon-free energy. \nCFE for commercial real estate faces different challenges, \nincluding variability in building characteristics, work patterns, and geographic locations with a broad range of electricity grid carbon intensities. In addition to helping us achieve our own climate goals, pursuing CFE for our offices can help expand clean energy options in the cities we call home. \nGolden Hills wind farm in California (43 MW for Google)\n   44\n2023 Environmental Report  FIGURE 18\nGlobal data center carbon-free energy map\nCHILE\n90%TENNESSEE\n63%\nOREGON\n89%\nOKLAHOMA\n87%IOWA\n96%\nNEBRASKA\n87%\nNEVADA\n27%\nTEXAS\n41%UTAH\n31%IRELAND\n39%\nBELGIUM80%NETHERLANDS57%\nALABAMA\n63%JAPAN\n16%\nGEORGIA\n40%SOUTH CAROLINA26%NORTH CAROLINA63%VIRGINIA60%\nTAIWAN18%FINLAND97%DENMARK90%\nSINGAPORE\n4%OHIO60%\n100% match with \ncarbon-free energy\n0% match with\ncarbon-free energyMidnight\n12:0006:00 18:00How to read clocks\nExampleIn 2022, Google reached 64% \ncarbon-free energy globally on an hourly basis. This performance varied widely by region, with seven of our regions achieving at least 90% carbon-free energy, and thirteen achieving at least 85%.   45\n2023 Environmental Report  Innovative purchasing \nmodels\nOur early adoption and long-term support of clean energy \nprojects has coincided with the rapid growth of the industry and remarkable declines in the cost of solar and wind power.\n\u200992 Along the way, we\u2019ve pioneered innovative \nnew contracting models and industry partnerships to help accelerate the adoption of corporate clean energy practices and make clean energy more accessible to a wider range of corporate buyers.\nNew contracting approaches\nIn 2022, we published a white paper outlining details of the CFE Manager model , a new approach to clean energy \nprocurement that can help a wide range of energy buyers streamline their clean energy purchasing. We share three case studies where Google recently signed CFE Manager agreements\u2014in Virginia, Germany, and California\u2014and discuss some contractual terms and issues that buyers pursuing these agreements should consider.\nIn addition to the CFE manager model, in 2022 we piloted \na new approach to clean energy requests for proposals that can reduce the time to negotiate and execute a clean energy PPA by up to 80%. We\u2019re hopeful this new approach will give clean energy buyers and sellers useful new options for negotiating PPAs, and enable all organizations that want to decarbonize their electricity use to join us on the journey to 24/7 CFE.\nHelping local communities\nFinally, we believe that our clean energy procurement shouldn\u2019t only benefit the climate, but also the local communities that host our facilities\u2014in particular, historically underserved communities  that haven\u2019t \ntypically benefited from the clean energy transition. Three years ago, we started a journey to better understand how we can help lower barriers to an equitable clean energy transition, culminating in two additions to our clean energy procurement approach that respond to those challenges. \nThe first program extends clean energy\u2019s financial \nbenefits to local communities. Through a first-of-its-kind partnership with EDPR NA Distributed Generation , \nwe\u2019ll create a 500 MW community-based solar portfolio, adding clean energy to the regional U.S. PJM power grid and providing Google with Renewable Energy Credits that contribute to 24/7 CFE . At least 10% of the portfolio\u2019s \nrevenues will be redirected annually for up to 15 years as utility bill credits to more than 25,000 households facing a high energy burden. \nThe second program aims to spur long-term investments \nto improve housing infrastructure. Through a partnership with Sol Systems , we\u2019re providing funding to three rural \nelectric cooperatives and one regional organization with deep roots in North Carolina and South Carolina to undertake critical home pre-weatherization and safety upgrades for low- and moderate-income households. Alongside this investment, the partnership will deliver new solar energy and battery storage resources, moving us closer to 24/7 CFE and bringing clean energy to one of the most challenging grids to decarbonize. \nBoth of these programs are based on discussions with  \nU.S. government officials, national NGOs, and policy advocates about challenges to an equitable energy transition in their communities. We\u2019ll continue to build on these programs to extend the benefits of our investments to underserved communities.Accelerating new and \nimproved technologies\nWind and solar power have played a critical role in \nenabling Google\u2019s clean energy progress, but meeting 24/7 CFE\u2014and maximizing our contribution to global decarbonization\u2014will require expanding our technology toolkit. In 2022, we continued to work on a wide range  of projects to demonstrate, scale, and maximize the climate impact of carbon-free energy technologies,  using Google\u2019s engineering capabilities and purchasing demand to accelerate the commercialization of new  clean energy technologies:\n \u2022 Optimizing generation from existing CFE technologies: To reduce the carbon footprint of  \nour new Bay View and Charleston East campuses, we designed and installed \u201c dragonscale ,\u201d a new solar \nroofing technology that helps us power our facilities through on-site generation. Learn more in our  Bay View spotlight .\n \u2022 Managing energy demand across our global operations: We developed a \u201ccarbon-intelligent computing platform\u201d that optimizes the timing and location of computing tasks based on local CFE availability. This allows us to shift some of our data centers\u2019 computing tasks to the times of day when local solar and wind power are most plentiful, and  to shift tasks geographically  across data centers so \nthat we can do more computing in regions where  CFE is abundant.\n \u2022 Accelerating next generation energy sources:  \nIn 2021, we signed the first corporate agreement to develop a next-generation geothermal  power project, \nand in 2022, we installed the first-ever battery-based backup  power system for a data center at our \nfacility in St. Ghislain, Belgium. This application will enable Google to optimize the carbon footprint of backup power, buying local, low-carbon power for backup when available rather than relying on diesel generators.\n \u2022 Improving energy data and clean energy tracking: Google is driving the development of advanced methods for tracking clean energy, including time-based energy attribute certificates . We\u2019re also working \nto improve the quality, consistency, and granularity of grid electricity data through active collaborations with organizations including EnergyTag, Electricity Maps, FlexiDAO, and more.We\u2019re deploying machine learning solutions to optimize wind power forecasting  and project economics . \nFor our Bay View campus, a first-of-its-kind building-integrated solar panel called \u201cdragonscale\u201d was developed  to create a seamless design. (Photo: Iwan Baan)\n   46\n2023 Environmental Report  Transforming the \nenergy system through partnerships and advocacy\nGlobal search interest in    \u201csustainable energy \u201d   \nreached an all-time high in March 2022.\u200993 Our 24/7 CFE \nefforts are designed to maximize our contribution to the \ndecarbonization of power grids worldwide. That\u2019s why we\u2019re supporting others to join us on the journey to 24/7 CFE, by sharing insights and lessons we\u2019re learning and new approaches we\u2019re developing. \nOne such example is the United Nations 24/7 Carbon-\nfree Energy Compact , which we helped launch with \nSustainable Energy for All and other partners in 2021. The Compact is a global community dedicated to building the technologies, policies, tools, ideas, and advocacy needed to accelerate the decarbonization of electricity grids. In Europe, we work with the European 24/7 CFE Hub, a collaboration with Eurelectric to create a platform where energy buyers, suppliers, and policy makers can meet to learn more about 24/7 CFE and receive technical training and implementation guidance.\nPublic policy and advocacy\nIn addition to corporate action, we recognize that the clean energy transition also requires strong actions from governments, and we call for ambitious public policies aimed at decarbonizing electricity grids worldwide. In 2022, we published a first-of-its-kind policy roadmap sharing our recommendations for energy policy and market reforms to accelerate electricity decarbonization, informed by our experiences as a large energy user and clean energy buyer around the world. As we advance toward our goal of 24/7 CFE, we\u2019re committed to working with others and advocating for clean energy policies that can enable 24/7 CFE for all energy consumers by decarbonizing electricity grids at the scale and pace required to meet the world\u2019s climate challenge.\nWe also recognize that accurate, comprehensive, and \nactionable corporate GHG inventories are essential to help companies understand their carbon footprints and determine how to mitigate emissions. That\u2019s why we recently submitted comments  in response to an open \nsurvey  on the future of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol \n(GHGP). Updating the GHGP will drive continued improvements in the accuracy of companies\u2019 GHG inventories, providing useful information that enables them to make decisions and take actions that drive real, measurable GHG reductions.\nFor more information on our public policy and advocacy, \nsee the Governance and engagement section.\nCFE investments\nGoogle works with suppliers around the world. The electricity grids in many countries where our suppliers operate lack sufficient carbon-free energy capacity to support rapidly growing demand, and may even face energy shortages that affect not just manufacturing but also the communities and livelihoods of the people in these regions. Our long-term vision is that all of our suppliers\u2014for hardware manufacturing, transport, logistics, and indirect services\u2014and their communities have access to reliable, cost-effective, carbon-free energy. And we\u2019ll get there only through significant global investment in new wind, solar, and other clean energy capacity, as well as more robust grid systems.In addition to purchasing renewable energy for our own operations, we also make targeted investments in renewable energy. Investment in renewable capacity is a scalable approach to creating system-level change by driving grid decarbonization and enabling greater access to carbon-free energy. This is especially significant in markets where credible procurement mechanisms for clean energy are nascent or nonexistent. We aim to invest in clean energy projects that reduce emissions and serve manufacturing operations across our supply chain.\nGoogle aims to enable 5 GW of new carbon-free \nenergy through investments in our key manufacturing regions by 2030. In 2022, we signed agreements to invest approximately $350 million to support 0.5 GW of renewable energy projects towards this 5 GW total. This builds on our long-standing track record in this space; From 2010 to 2022, we entered into agreements to invest nearly $2.9 billion in renewable energy projects with an expected combined generation capacity of approximately 4.2 GW.\nTowards our 5 GW goal, Google\u2019s investments will be \ntargeted to support bringing additional carbon-free energy capacity online in key manufacturing regions around the globe, including in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Such projects may reduce Google\u2019s carbon footprint directly, may reduce a Google supplier\u2019s carbon footprint, or may simply help decarbonize the local grid.  \nAsia Pacific\u2014a critical region for our suppliers\u2014is one of \nthe most challenging regions for contracting or investing in carbon-free energy projects.\n\u200994 Making carbon-free \nenergy investments in key Asia Pacific regions is, and will continue to be, an area of deep focus for Google moving forward. Google has identified several promising carbon-free energy investment opportunities in the region, all of which are in various stages of due diligence.CFE for supplier operations\nMore of our suppliers are using renewable energy. Of the suppliers invited to report to Google via CDP Supply Chain, 26% (58 suppliers) said they have renewable energy targets, and 12% (26 suppliers) have targets that are part of the RE100  initiative. To accelerate decarbonization of \nour supply chain, we\u2019re engaging with our key suppliers to encourage them to commit to procuring 100% renewable energy for their operations.  \nOur work in increasing supplier access to renewable \nenergy is intentionally inclusive. We aim for our investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency to drive better manufacturing across Google\u2019s supply chain and\u2014importantly\u2014to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing for people and communities around the\u00a0world. \nLooking ahead, we\u2019re working to:\n\u2022 Close our first renewable energy investment deal in a \nkey Asia Pacific manufacturing region, working toward our broader goal to enable 5 GW of new carbon-free energy in key regions by 2030.\n\u2022 Increase access to cost-effective renewable energy at scale for supply chain partners in key manufacturing regions through direct supplier and public policy engagements.\n\u2022 Participate in advocacy efforts related to supply chain renewable energy and carbon mitigation, working collaboratively with industry-leading institutions to research solutions and share best practices.   47\n2023 Environmental Report  Managing residual emissions\nWe aim to avoid or reduce GHG emissions to reach our \nabsolute emissions reduction target, but there are some emissions that will remain difficult to abate. We\u2019re taking multiple approaches to address these residual emissions and are aiming to play an important role in advancing the development and deployment of nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions.\nAs we continue to build out these efforts, we\u2019ll share \nan annual disclosure of our use of carbon credits and removals on our path to net-zero emissions. This will include information about our criteria, approach, and portfolio, including details on project purchases and any relevant certifications.\n2022 HIGHLIGHT\nWe contributed $200 million to \nFrontier, an advanced market commitment that\u2019s accelerating the development of carbon removal technologies, as one of five companies that made a $925 million total pledge.\nCarbon removal \nsolutions\nWhile permanent carbon removal solutions aren\u2019t yet \neconomically viable or deployed at scale, the IPCC stated in 2022 that \u201cthe deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to counterbalance hard-to-abate residual emissions is unavoidable if net-zero emissions are to be achieved.\u201d\n\u200995 That\u2019s why we\u2019re supporting the development \nand commercialization of emerging carbon removal technologies, as well as the development of initiatives to ensure the integrity and climate impact of CDR solutions. \nStarting in 2022, we began funding the development of \nnature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions. At the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in 2022, Google joined the First Movers Coalition . As a \nchampion for the Carbon Dioxide Removal sector, Google committed to contract for durable and scalable net carbon dioxide removal to be achieved by the end of 2030.\nIn 2022, we contributed $200 million towards a $925 million \ntotal pledge to Frontier , an advanced market commitment \nthat\u2019s accelerating the development of carbon removal technologies by guaranteeing future demand. As a founding member of Frontier, we\u2019re signing our first offtake deals in 2023, with removals expected to be delivered starting in 2024. Already, Frontier has announced its first deal, a partnership with the start-up Charm Industrial to remove 112,000 tons of CO\n2 between 2024 and 2030.\nStrengthening carbon \nmarkets\nWhile CDR technologies are being proven and scaled over \nthe short to medium term, we believe that carbon credits can play a valuable role in keeping the world on track for a 1.5\u00baC future. Since 2007, we\u2019ve supported the capture and destruction of highly potent greenhouse gasses through the procurement of high-quality carbon credits .\nSince we began procuring high-quality carbon credits, we\u2019ve learned a lot from our experience \u2014including the \nimportance of developing and following guiding principles related to credit quality, implementing robust validation processes, and establishing long-term partnerships with project owners and developers. We\u2019re now working to help strengthen carbon credit markets through engagement with other companies and stakeholders in the scientific, academic, and NGO communities. We\u2019re partnering on improving measurement, reporting, and verification and developing tools to support robust, well-functioning markets. For example, Google.org has contributed more than $6 million to efforts to strengthen carbon markets, digitize their infrastructure, and set standards for high-quality carbon credits. \nAs we move forward on our path to net-zero emissions, \nwe\u2019ll continue to evolve our approach to counterbalancing our residual emissions. \n Google and clean-energy startup Fervo signed the world\u2019s first corporate agreement to develop a next-generation geothermal power project.   48\n2023 Environmental Report  The journey ahead\nAs we move forward on our journey to reduce our \nemissions, we\u2019ll continue to focus both on our own footprint and on the larger systems that serve us\u2014from electricity grids to transportation networks to materials supply chains. \nWe\u2019ve made great progress in procuring clean energy,  \nbut we still have a long way to go to meet our 2030  net-zero target. We recognize we\u2019ll face many challenges along the way, for example:\n \u2022 Meeting our growing energy needs\n \u2022 Availability of carbon-free energy\n \u2022 Cost and limited volumes of carbon removals\nFor more details, see the Challenges to address  section above.\nWe also know we can\u2019t get there alone. To scale our  \nwork, we\u2019ve created tools, white papers, and case studies to help others adopt some of the approaches that have worked for us.\n \u2022 The CFE manager: A new model for driving decarbonization impact\n \u2022 Time-based energy attribute certificatesThe clean energy transition also requires strong actions from governments, and we call for ambitious public policies aimed at decarbonizing electricity grids worldwide.\n \u2022 Policy recommendations to accelerate  \ncarbon-free energy\nUltimately, achieving a carbon-free future for all requires rapid and far-reaching transformations to these systems, and as we grow our efforts towards net-zero emissions for our own footprint, we\u2019ll prioritize actions where we can make unique contributions and maximize our impact on larger systems change. \nLEARN MORE\n \u2022 Accelerating climate action at Google and beyond: \nA progress update\n \u2022 24/7 carbon-free energy: Methodologies and metrics\nEl Romero solar farm in Chile (80 MW for Google)   49\n2023 Environmental Report  Water \nstewardship\nWe aim to replenish more \nwater than we consume and help improve water quality and ecosystem health in the communities where we operateOur ambition\nOur approach\nAdvancing responsible \nwater use\nBenefiting watersheds and \ncommunities \nSupporting water security \nwith technology\nThe journey ahead\nOur ambition\nThe world is facing an unprecedented water crisis, with global freshwater demand predicted to exceed supply by 40% by 2030.\n\u200996 Climate change has exacerbated \nwater stress, causing destabilizing droughts and unpredictable flooding around the world. \nIn 2021, we announced our commitment to water \nstewardship : we aim to replenish 120% of the freshwater\u200997 \nvolume we consume, on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030, and help restore and improve the quality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate. This ambition is bold, particularly when considering both the growth of our business and the challenges and complexities of global water stewardship work. Understanding the most impactful intervention requires local context, and water replenishment is still a maturing field with some limitations to identifying ready-to-implement project opportunities. \nWe\u2019re working to achieve this replenishment target \nthrough continued and scaled investments in projects that are located within the watersheds we rely on to provide water to our data centers and offices. We work with external partners to implement these projects, which deliver both volumetric water benefits and improve other locally relevant aspects of watershed health, such as water quality, community water access, and biodiversity. Our approach\nAt Google, we use water to help cool our data centers, and in our offices around the world. Water is also used throughout our value chain, in the manufacturing of both consumer hardware products and data center equipment.\nWe work to drive water efficiency and reuse across our \nglobal operations, from reducing our potable water use intensity at our San Francisco Bay Area headquarters to using seawater for cooling at our data center in Hamina, Finland.\nOur water stewardship strategy  is centered on \nassessing and addressing water-related risks to our \nbusiness and the opportunities we have to not just mitigate those risks, but also create solutions that can be scaled beyond our own corporate footprint. We also strive to partner with others to address this shared challenge.\nWhen it comes to addressing shared water challenges, \ntechnology can be a useful tool to bring visibility to these challenges to enable smarter, more informed decision-making. We\u2019re building tools to make water data and technology universally accessible, enabling effective water stewardship and improving the resilience of watersheds and ecosystems.   50\n2023 Environmental Report  Advancing responsible water use\nWe\u2019re committed to advancing and enhancing our water \nmanagement practices across our operational footprint  \nat Google\u2019s offices and data centers around the world.  \nWe continue to collaborate, test, and share our learnings \non responsible water use. This includes accelerating water reuse practices across our offices and data centers, and tailoring site-specific solutions  based on facility types, \nlocations, and local water contexts.\nIn 2022, total water consumption at our data centers and \noffices was 5.6 billion gallons\u2014the equivalent of what it takes to irrigate 37 golf courses annually, on average, in the southwestern United States.\n\u200998 Wherever feasible, we try to use non-potable sources of freshwater and alternatives to freshwater.\nAs part of our commitment to using water responsibly, we \nevaluate and take into account local water stress when deciding where to locate our facilities, how to design them, and how to operate them\u2014from water systems in our offices to cooling systems in our data centers. That\u2019s why, in 2022, 82%  of our freshwater withdrawals came \nfrom regions with low water stress.\n\u200999 In locations facing \nwater stress, we\u2019re actively exploring new partnerships and opportunities to improve overall watershed health and resilience. By working to replenish more than we consume, we\u2019re striving to help address the water scarcity gap.\nOur water stewardship focus areas\nFIGURE 19\nAdvance responsible \nwater use\nEnhance our stewardship \nof water resources across \nGoogle office campuses \nand data centers\nBenefit watersheds \nand communities\nCollaborate to replenish \nour\u00a0freshwater consumption and \nimprove watershed health while \nsupporting ecosystems and \nwater-stressed communities\nSupport water security \nwith technology\nShare technology and tools \nthat enable everyone to \npredict, prevent, and recover \nfrom water stress\nData centers\nTo minimize the net-climate impact at each of our data center campuses, both today and in the future, we consult with local experts and make regionally appropriate cooling technology decisions that balance the availability of carbon-free energy and responsibly sourced water. \nIn many places, water is the most efficient means of \ncooling. When used responsibly, water cooling can play an important role in reducing emissions. We\u2019ve found that our water-cooled data centers use about 10% less energy and emit roughly 10% less carbon emissions than our air-cooled data centers.\n\u2009100\nAt our data centers, we aim to implement technologies and solutions that reduce freshwater consumption when feasible, and use alternative sources such as reclaimed wastewater and even seawater. We withdraw reclaimed or non-potable water at 25% of our data center campuses. Due to these solutions, 23% of our total data center water withdrawal (excluding seawater) is reclaimed wastewater and other non-potable water. For example, at our data center in Douglas County, Georgia, we redirect local sewer water that would otherwise be discharged in the Chattahoochee River and use it to cool our facility. Additionally, our data center in Hamina, Finland, uses seawater for cooling rather than withdrawing freshwater. Additionally, at our data center in Eemshaven, the Netherlands, we partnered with the community to bring in industrial canal water to cool our data center, leaving potable water for other uses. \nIn 2022, we described our climate-conscious data \ncenter cooling strategy , in which we both championed \nresponsible water use and explained how this work complements our efforts to run on 24/7 CFE on every grid where we operate by 2030. In this blog, we published our 2021 annual water metrics for our U.S. data center locations, and committed to sharing annual water metrics for additional global locations beginning with this report.  See our Environmental data tables  for our 2022 water \ndata\u2014disclosed both globally and by data center location.\nThese colorful pipes in our Douglas County, Georgia data center send and receive water for cooling our facility.   51\n2023 Environmental Report  Offices\nAround the world, our offices use water for a variety \nof needs including preparing food, cleaning and \nhygiene, irrigating campus landscapes, and keeping our \nworkspaces cool. We take a variety of approaches to \nmanage water responsibly and drive responsible water \nuse in our real estate operations through increased \nefficiency and by sourcing water from non-potable \nsupplies.\nOne of the main ways we conserve water in Google \nworkplaces is by adopting design standards  aligned \nwith leading third-party certifications, including LEED \nand the LBC. Our building design requirements for new \nconstruction include the incorporation of water-efficient \nfixtures, such as faucets, toilets, and irrigation systems. \nThese design standards also address replacing old fixtures \nwith highly efficient ones in any space we move into, and \ninstalling water meters with automatic leak detection. In \nmultiple offices around the world, we\u2019ve achieved Alliance \nfor Water Stewardship certification, a leading third-party \nstandard that helps us develop best-in-class, regional \nstrategies for responsible water use, and to engage with \nlocal partners on watershed health projects.\nBeyond these standards, we drive water stewardship in our \nworkplaces by developing innovative solutions  that strive \nto be replicable and scalable. For example, our new Bay \nView campus , which opened  in 2022, is on track to be the \nlargest development project in the world to achieve Water \nPetal certification from the LBC, with an on-site stormwater \nand wastewater treatment system that can serve as a \nmodel for others. Learn more in our Bay View spotlight .Supply chain\nAddressing water challenges requires accurate water \nuse data throughout our supply chain. By monitoring \nthis data, we can focus our water stewardship efforts \non supplier facilities with the greatest opportunities for \nimproved management. To measure water use and assess \nwater risk in our value chain, we ask suppliers to disclose \nwater-related data  via the CDP supply chain platform \nand complete and disclose water risk assessments of their \ndirect operations and value chain.\nIn 2022, 177 of the 186 suppliers (95%) that were invited \nto participate in the Water Security portion of the CDP \nSupply Chain survey responded. This reporting includes \ndata on water withdrawal, consumption, and discharge\u2014\nall water withdrawn from all sources (e.g., surface water, \ngroundwater, rainwater, municipal water supply, and \ntrucked water), the portion of water permanently lost in the \nwithdrawal (e.g., evaporated or incorporated into products \nfrom cooling, irrigation, and production processes), and the \nwater effluents discharged to all locations (e.g., subsurface \nand surface waters, sewers, and groundwater).\nTo\u00a0learn more about how we assess and manage our water-\nrelated risks, see the Governance and engagement  section.\n2022 HIGHLIGHT\nAs of the end of 2022, we estimate \nour 38 replenishment projects had the \ncapacity to replenish over 1.3 billion \ngallons of water annually once  \nfully implemented.\u2009101\nSteam rises above the cooling towers at our data center in The Dalles, Oregon.    52\n2023 Environmental Report  Benefiting watersheds and \ncommunities\nMany watersheds around the world are degrading\u00a0in health, \nwith each location facing unique challenges. Improving watershed and ecosystem health is a critical part of our strategy, which allows us to focus on solutions to shared water challenges that are impacting watersheds the most, whether they\u2019re related to water quantity and availability, water quality, ecosystem and habitat degradation, loss of biodiversity, or community access to water.\nIn addition to focusing on responsible water use within our \noperations, we aim to replenish 20% more freshwater than we consume each year, on a global average basis. We\u2019ll focus our replenishment efforts in watersheds that Google offices and data centers rely on. The additional volume of water we replenish at each location will vary depending on the local conditions, and we\u2019ll prioritize replenishment projects in water-scarce regions to help ensure that we\u2019re positively impacting the areas that need it most.\nAs of the end of 2022, the first full year since we launched \nthis strategy and target, our contracted watershed projects have replenished 271 million gallons of water\n\u2009102\u2014\nequivalent to more than 400 Olympic-sized swimming pools. This represents 6% of our 2022 freshwater consumption. As of the end of 2022, we estimate that these 38 replenishment projects had the capacity to replenish over 1.3 billion gallons of water annually once fully implemented.Water replenishment \nprojects\nIn support of our water stewardship strategy, we\u2019ve made \nprogress in helping to restore and improve the quality of water and health of ecosystems in the watersheds we rely on. We\u2019ve intentionally designed our strategy to prioritize a range of watershed health issues, enabling us to invest in a diverse set of impactful watershed health projects that are appropriate for each local context.\nWe conduct regular water risk assessments of our global \nassets to identify priority basins. Within each priority basin, we assess local water context and shared water challenges through data analysis and engaging with local partners and stakeholders.\nAs of the end of 2022, we\u2019ve supported 38 water \nstewardship projects  in 26 watersheds (see Figure 20).  \nIn 2022 alone, we added 25 projects to our portfolio.\nThis marked a strong first year of implementation of our \nwater replenishment strategy, and while we still have a long way to go to meet our 2030 target, we\u2019re proud of the impactful partnerships that we\u2019ve already engaged in around the world. We\u2019re excited to continue working alongside our existing partners and to find new partners in water-stressed geographies where we\u2019ll work over the next few years.TARGET\nReplenish 120% of the \nfreshwater volume we consume, on average, across our offices and data centers by 20302022 PROGRESS\nAs of the en d of 2022, our \ncontracted watershed projects have replenished 271 million gallons of water, or 6%  of our \n2022 freshwater consumption\nDETAILS\nYear set: 2021    |    Base year: N/A    |    Target year: 2030\nScope: Freshwater replenished annually (excluding seawater and reclaimed wastewater), as a percentage of the amount of freshwater we consume each year at our offices and data centers.

We need 1.75 Earths to sustain our current rate of natural resource consumption, but we only have one planet.\n\u2009105 The circular \neconomy aims to minimize waste and maximize reuse of existing materials. An important component of this is promoting safer materials for human and environmental health, to maximize their reuse potential. The circular economy offers a tremendous opportunity for new business and innovation, capable of generating an estimated $4.5 trillion in new economic output by 2030.\n\u2009106\nThe world can\u2019t achieve net-zero carbon emissions \nwithout accelerating the circular economy. Roughly 45% of global GHGs come from embodied carbon emissions, generated from creating new goods and infrastructure.\n\u2009107 \nWe can reduce up to 10 GT of carbon by 2050 through circular strategies, such as using recycled materials and low-carbon building approaches.\n\u2009108\nTo support the transition to a circular economy, we aim to become a circular Google \u2014maximizing the reuse of finite \nresources across our operations, products, and supply chains and enabling others to do the same.Our approach\nOur impact on the circular economy cuts across all our core business operations. It includes the data centers we build and operate to power our products, the workplaces where Googlers come together to create the next breakthrough technology, and the consumer hardware products that people use every day. Our impact also spans the entire value chain, including data centers , \nworkplaces and stores, products , and our suppliers , \nand we\u2019ve set goals to measure our progress in each area.\nOur circularity principles focus on designing out waste \nfrom the start, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and promoting healthy materials\u2014for our data centers, workplaces, and products (see Figure 21).   56\n2023 Environmental Report  FIGURE 21\nOur circularity principles\nWe design out  \nwaste and pollution\nWe design for circularity from the start, making it easier \nfor the materials used in the creation of our products, \nworkplaces, and data centers to be reused in the futureWe keep materials in use  \nas long as safely possible\nWe pursue strategies to extend the life of our products, \nworkplaces, and data centers for as long as safely possible  \nto maximize the use of materials that went into their creation We promote safe and \nhealthy materials\nWe design products, workplaces, and data centers with \nhealthy materials that are safe for people and for the \nenvironment, enabling them to be safely reused in the future\nA Google Nest Audio is disassembled.   57\n2023 Environmental Report  Reducing data center waste\nStorage at Google\u2019s Singapore data center.\nZero waste to landfill \nIn 2016, we announced our aim to achieve Zero Waste \nto Landfill for our global data center operations. As of the end of 2022, 10 out of 26 (38%) Google-owned and -operated data centers have met this Zero Waste to Landfill target (see Figure 22). For example, our data center in Fredericia, Denmark, achieved Zero Waste to Landfill from day one. Our data center waste footprint increases as we increase the number of our data centers, so we continue working towards our target as we grow. In 2022, across our global fleet of Google-owned and -operated data center operations, we diverted 86% of operational waste away from landfills. \nBeyond these goals for landfill waste, our approach \nto circularity for data center equipment is to maintain servers for as long as possible, refurbish components for future reuse, reuse or resell components following a rigorous security process, and recycle any components that can\u2019t be reused.\nSince 2015, we\u2019ve resold more than 37 million hardware \ncomponents  from our data centers into the secondary \nmarket for reuse by other organizations, including nearly 5 million resold components in 2022 alone. As of the end of 2022, 21% of components used for server deployment, maintenance, and upgrades were refurbished inventory.\nLooking forward, we continue to face challenges for waste \ndiversion at a local level due to the lack of availability of recycling infrastructure in some of the rural communities where we operate and inconsistencies in what\u2019s accepted for recycling.TARGET\nAchieve Zero Waste to \nLandfill for our global data center operations2022 PROGRESS\n38% of Go ogle-owned and \n-operated data centers have achieved Zero Waste to Landfill \nDETAILS\nYear set: 2016    |    Base year: N/A    |    Target year: N/A\nScope: Annual operational waste for all Google-owned and -operated data centers globally.  \u201cZero Waste to Landfill\u201d means that more than 90% of waste is diverted from landfill. When possible,  we strive to align measurement of waste diversion at our data centers with the UL Environment Standard 2799 Environmental Claim Validation Procedure for Zero Waste to Landfill.\nFIGURE 22\nData centers achieving zero waste to landfill\nLegend\nStill progressing toward zero waste to landfill goal\nZero waste to landfill goal achieved \n   58\n2023 Environmental Report  Building circular workplaces and stores\nBuilding design and construction is one of the largest \nsources of global waste\u2014roughly 30% of all global annual waste comes from building construction and demolition.\n\u2009109 When we design and build Google \nworkplaces and stores around the world, we strive to deliver on our commitment to accelerating the circular economy. \nWhen the right opportunity comes up, we pursue \nadaptive reuse projects, renovating existing buildings to serve a new purpose rather than demolishing them for new builds. These reuse projects tend to use fewer materials, produce less construction waste, and have lower embodied carbon. They also preserve community history, giving historic structures new life as Google workplaces and, in some cases, community spaces, too. \nSome examples include our Playa Vista , California , \noffice\u2014a repurposed 1943 airplane hangar, and our  \nPier 57 office in New York City\u2014a historic cruise terminal \nand transit depot that sat vacant for 20 years before Google reimagined it into an office and community space. \nWe also consider adaptive reuse for our data centers, \nsuch as for our data center in Hamina, Finland , which was \nformerly an abandoned paper mill.Circular design and \nconstruction\nTo make our workplaces more circular, we design \nadaptable spaces that can be adjusted over time using fewer renovation materials, we incorporate reuse and material salvage  practices, and we provide a rigorous \nmodel for healthy materials that can be adopted by others. For example, our Bay View and Charleston East  campuses both incorporate salvaged materials \ninto the building design, and both aim to reduce future renovation waste through highly flexible and reconfigurable work areas.\nFor more than a decade, we\u2019ve prioritized building \nmaterials that demonstrate safer chemistry to create healthy indoor environments and advance our circularity goals. One way we promote healthy materials is by leveraging third-party standards like the LBC, one of the most ambitious green building certifications in the world. Our focus on transparency aims to encourage stronger standards in the building industry at large, paving the way for others to purchase healthier materials. \nWe recently opened or advanced several workplace \nand store projects that reflect these core principles of circular design and construction (see Figure 23). Our   \nBay View campus \u2014opened in 2022\u2014also incorporates \nour circularity principles of designing out waste from the start, keeping materials in use for as long as possible,  \nand promoting healthy materials.

The existing building was transformed into a workplace that embodies regenerative design and promotes well-being. Materials were given a second chance throughout the building\u2014from still-functioning components of the original mechanical systems to roughly 300 interior doors made with veneer from oak trees salvaged from recent California wildfires. In total, nearly 3,400 tons of waste (or 91% of total waste generated) was diverted from landfill during its construction.\nCharleston East\nin Mountain View, California, U.S.A. \nIn 2022, we advanced construction for our \nCharleston East campus, with the goal of expanding the boundaries of sustainable design, including around healthy and reclaimed materials. Charleston East is on track to achieve LEED-NC v4 Platinum certification and be one of the largest new construction projects ever to attain the LBC Materials Petal Certification, which helps ensure the health of the building occupants, the local community, and the broader supply chain. Using the LBC Red List as a framework, thousands of materials on the project went through a rigorous sourcing and review process. The design of Charleston East also incorporates salvaged materials and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified wood products.\nGoogle store\nin Chelsea, New York, U.S.A.\nIn 2021, we opened our first flagship retail store in New York City\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood, which achieved LEED-ID+C Retail v4 Platinum status. Every element of the Google Store\u2014the materials, building processes, mechanical systems and more\u2014was painstakingly considered and selected. For example, the veneer on the walls is a soft gray, responsibly-sourced hickory, and our custom cork and wood furniture was created with a local craftsman from Greenpoint, Brooklyn. We even attached our carpeting (which was manufactured with recycled materials) in a sustainable way. In 2022, we opened our second retail location in Brooklyn, New York, which also earned a LEED-ID+C Retail v4 Platinum rating.\nBolands Mills  \nin Dublin, Ireland\nOur Bolands Mills office is the reincarnation of a 150-year-old flour mill, repurposed as a workspace for Googlers. There are plans for a public ground-floor food market that will reforge visitors\u2019 connection to food. With Bolands Mills, we have the opportunity to preserve an iconic heritage site while creating a place that will support Google and the neighborhood for years to come.\n   60\n2023 Environmental Report  Workplace Operations\nWe take a holistic approach to circularity in our offices, \nstarting with designing buildings for zero-waste operations. Not only do we strive to divert solid waste from landfills and incinerators for office operations, but we also aim to minimize the amount of materials we use and maximize their lifespan within our ecosystem and the surrounding community. We have ambitious targets for food loss and waste , and we\u2019re working to reduce single-\nuse plastics in our operations.\nIn 2022, the global landfill diversion rate for our offices \nwas 75% . To ensure that what we keep out of landfills can \nactually be recovered, we prioritize diverting high-quality materials and only count non-contaminated recyclable material.\n\u2009110\nFood waste\nGlobal searches for     \u201chow to reduce food waste \u201d     \nhave more than doubled over the most recent five-year period compared to the previous five-year period,\n\u2009111 \nreaching a 15-year high in 2022.\u2009112 When food waste ends \nup rotting in landfills, it generates methane\u2014a greenhouse gas that\u2019s 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.\n\u2009113 \n What\u2019s more, when food goes to waste, so do all of the water, energy, and other resources that went into producing it.\nTo achieve a low-carbon circular economy, we need \nto collectively cut back on food waste. At Google, that means doubling down  on our efforts to reduce waste in \nour kitchens, cafes, and overall food operations.Our goal\nIn 2022, we announced our food waste goal: by 2025,  we aim to send zero food waste to the landfill. Towards this goal, we aim to cut food waste in half for each Googler, compared to a 2019 baseline.\nWe\u2019re on track to cut food waste in half for each Googler \nand send zero food waste to the landfill by 2025. In 2022, we diverted 85% of food waste from landfill, and and we\u2019ve reduced food waste per Googler by 18% since 2019.\n\u2009114 We\u2019re seeing progress across all operations in \nall regions, across different types of cafes, and by using different intervention levers to spark necessary behavior and operational change. \nFrom 2014 through 2021, we prevented nearly 10 million \npounds of food from entering landfills.\nOur focus areas\nTo further reduce food waste, we\u2019re strengthening our efforts in three key areas across our food program:\n \u2022 In our kitchen and cafe operations , we\u2019re preventing \nwaste from the moment we receive ingredients all the way through to serving a finished dish.\n \u2022 At the sourcing and procurement stage, we\u2019re working with our suppliers, distributors, and vendors to prevent waste before it happens.\n \u2022 When there\u2019s excess food \u2014whether as prepared \ndishes or plate waste\u2014we\u2019re ensuring it\u2019s donated or properly composted.TARGET\nDivert all food waste from \nlandfill by 20252022 PROGRESS\n85%  of food waste diverted \nfrom landfill\nDETAILS\nYear set: 2022    |    Base year: N/A    |    Target year: 2025\nScope: Annual food waste diverted from landfill in kitchens and cafes at Google\u2019s offices globally. \u201cZero food waste to landfill\u201d is defined as 99% diversion of food waste from landfill via composting, anaerobic digestion, or other on-site processing.\nIn our kitchen and cafe operations, we\u2019re focused on ways to stop food waste before it starts.   61\n2023 Environmental Report  Kitchen and cafe operations\nWe\u2019re making measurable reductions across back-of-\nhouse operations through improved culinary practices and demand planning to ensure our production levels are consistent with user dining patterns. \nFor example, in the United States, we recorded a 22%\u201330% \nreduction in egg waste by cooking smaller batches, and in India we recorded a 50% reduction in per-plate waste following a multi-channel waste reduction campaign. \nSourcing and procurement  \nand excess food \nAdditional progress will rely heavily on continued \nengagement of our vendor partner operations teams, further enabling Googlers to join in, and expanding partnerships with municipal and community organizations to accelerate the pace of food donations and develop compost infrastructure.\nIn 2022, to activate industry-wide change, Google \nprovided $1 million in anchor funding to kickstart the ReFED Catalytic Grant Fund. The ReFED Catalytic Grant Fund provides nonprofit and for-profit organizations with recoverable and non-recoverable grants to de-risk and scale high-impact solutions to food waste.Single-use plastics\nThe world\u2019s plastic pollution  problem is a large and \ncomplex challenge\u2014more than 91% of plastic isn\u2019t recycled, and the majority is left sitting in landfills or littering our oceans and communities.\n\u2009115 Reducing plastic \nwaste requires entire industries to come together and take more meaningful action. At Google, that means rethinking our approach to the way we source products, serve food, and reduce our waste.\nImproving our plastics footprint isn\u2019t as simple as not \nbuying single-use plastics. To reduce single-use plastics (upstream) and bridge the infrastructure gaps for recycling and composting (downstream), we need to activate the entire food ecosystem, from manufacturers to distributors to waste management companies. \nWe do this by working with vendors and suppliers to \navoid or phase out products with single-use plastics; rethinking how we handle, store, prepare, and serve  food and beverages; and using fully recoverable materials that are recyclable or compostable.\nWe\u2019re piloting and scaling plastic-free processes  \nand products in our kitchens, cafes, and overall food \noperations. For example, we\u2019re installing beverage dispensers to replace single-use beverages. We\u2019re redefining what we serve\u2014and how we serve it\u2014to eliminate single-use plastics and ensure durable, washable dishware and cutlery are easy to choose.\n Looking to the future, we\u2019re also planning to create  \nfood spaces that design out waste from the start. \n Designing  \nmore sustainable consumer hardware products\nOur ambition  is to create consumer hardware products \nthat leave people, the planet, and our communities better \nthan we found them. Our consumer hardware products  \ninclude Pixel, Nest, Chromecast, and Fitbit devices.\nSince launching our first hardware products, we\u2019ve \nintegrated sustainability considerations into materials sourcing and science, engineering and supply chain operations, carbon emissions reductions, waste reduction, packaging products, and designing our  retail stores. \nWe aim to increase the circularity of our hardware \nproducts and operations by decreasing our use of mined materials and signaling our demand for a more circular economy in our procurement of recycled materials. This is in addition to extending the life of our products through software updates and expanded repair options.\nWe support greener electronics standards and \ncertifications, including UL 110, IEEE 1680.1, and the UL ECOLOGO Program.\n\u2009116\nThe aluminum in the phone enclosures of Pixel 5, 6, 6 Pro, 7, and 7 Pro is made with 100% recycled content, reducing the carbon footprint of the aluminum portion of the enclosures by over 35% compared to 100% primary aluminum.\n\u2009117   62\n2023 Environmental Report  Recycled materials \nReducing how much waste we generate as a company and \nminimizing the demand for new raw materials starts with how we source materials that go into our products.\nIn 2019, we announced our aim to include recycled \nmaterials in 100% of Google consumer hardware products launching in 2022 and every year after.\n\u2009118 We hit our goal \nearly\u2014in 2020\u2014and have maintained it each year since for Nest, Pixel, and Chromecast devices.\n\u2009119 In 2020, we shared \nour next steps on this journey.\nWe committed to   use recycled or renewable material in at \nleast 50% of plastic  used across our consumer hardware \nproduct portfolio by 2025, prioritizing recycled plastic everywhere we can. 41% of the plastic Google used in products manufactured in 2022 was recycled content.\n\u2009120\nApproximately 30% of the material Google used in its new products  launched and manufactured in 2022 was \nrecycled content.\n\u2009121 This includes recycled material used \nin our devices\u2019 aluminum , stainless steel , rare-earth \nmagnet , glass, and plastic  parts. \n2022 HIGHLIGHT\nThe aluminum in the phone enclosures \nof Pixel 5, 6, 6 Pro, 7, and 7 Pro is made with 100% recycled content, reducing the carbon footprint of the aluminum portion of the enclosures by over 35% compared to 100% primary aluminum.\n\u2009122 Using recycled materials can also lower the carbon \nfootprint of our product manufacturing. For example, the aluminum  in the phone enclosures of Pixel 5, 6, 6 Pro, 7, and \n7 Pro is made with 100% recycled content, reducing the carbon footprint of the aluminum portion of the enclosures by over 35% compared to 100% primary aluminum.\n\u2009123 For \nmore information on recycled material content for each of our products, see our Product Environmental Reports .\nWhile many waste materials can technically be recycled, whether or not they\u2019re actually recycled depends on market demand.

While there\u2019s much more work to do, we\u2019ve taken some initial steps in understanding consumers\u2019 and organizations\u2019 needs and creating new services for them.\nIt all starts with making sure products last long to begin \nwith. Enabling security updates and bug fixes helps promote product longevity. For Google Nest, we issue critical bug fixes and patches for at least five years after launch. Pixel 6 and later Pixel phones will get securityupdates for five years from when they first become available on the Google Store in the United States.\n\u2009130  \nAnd new Chromebooks are built with sustainability in mind, with automatic updates for up to eight years that keep them running fast and secure.\nRepairing electronics\nProviding new ways to repair electronics is an important way to extend their lives. In 2022, we announced our partnership with iFixit  to provide genuine Pixel spare parts, \ntools, and documentation on models as far back as Pixel 2 for users who are skilled in repair and independent service providers. This partnership, alongside our other mail-in    64\n2023 Environmental Report  and authorized service provider repair channels, lowers \ncosts and expands the choices customers have in Pixel phone repair. In tandem with our trade-in program , this \nextends the usable life of Pixel phones.\nIn 2022, we announced ChromeOS Flex  and the \nChromebook repair program , which aim to extend \nthe useful life of laptops, PCs, and Chromebooks alike. \nChromeOS Flex helps extend the life of aging Macs, PCs, and Linux devices by converting them to the ChromeOS ecosystem and reducing the amount of e-waste that\u2019s generated. In addition to providing up to eight years of software updates for Chromebooks, schools can easily identify which Chromebooks have commonly repaired components\u2014like the keyboard, display, and palmrest\u2014through our new repair program site . This is just the first \nstep, and we\u2019re looking forward to hearing feedback to help grow and improve the program.\nWe partner with device manufacturers (OEMs) to help \nincrease the number of new Chromebooks  that are made \nwith recycled materials and are easy to customize, repair, and upgrade. For example, the new Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition, made of 50% post-consumer recycled aluminum, is the most customizable Chromebook yet. It\u2019s durable, powerful, thin, light, and designed to last. Individuals can upgrade the laptop\u2019s memory and storage; replace key parts like the screen, battery, and webcam; and swap out the bezel with different colors, all without needing to replace their entire laptop. E-waste recycling\nSince all products will eventually become obsolete, availability of and participation in e-waste recycling programs is important to help keep electronics out of landfills and reuse the critical minerals within them. \nWe\u2019re focused on sourcing recycled and sustainable \nmaterials from our supply chain, and we recognize that the supply chain is only able to provide recycled materials when robust recycling collection, processing infrastructure, and technologies are available. For devices at the end of their service life, we offer free recycling in every country where we ship consumer hardware products.\n\u2009131\nWhile e-waste recycling programs are generally available, they often have low consumer participation rates. That\u2019s why, in 2022, we joined forces with industry peers and electronics recycling startup Retrievr on a new e-waste recycling pilot  designed to address the behavioral \nreasons that stop consumers from recycling. Unlike recycling household items like food packaging or shipping boxes, electronics have unique barriers  to overcome \nbefore consumers feel comfortable taking action. The goal of the pilot is to study how the industry can reduce barriers and increase participation in e-waste recycling.\nThe Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition is easy to upgrade and repair.   65\n2023 Environmental Report  Working with suppliers\nManufacturing waste\nMaterial that\u2019s lost during the product manufacturing \nprocess (often called \u201cyield losses\u201d) generates waste in our supply chain, so it\u2019s important to ensure that these waste streams are also captured and recycled. In 2020, we announced our target to achieve UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification at all final assembly manufacturing sites for our consumer hardware products by 2022.\nIn 2022, we certified 90% of our established consumer \nhardware final assembly sites to the UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill standard . These sites achieved at least Silver \ncertification level (representing a minimum 90% landfill diversion), with half of our sites achieving Platinum level (representing 100% landfill diversion). We plan to certify the re m\naining sites in the future. We also aim to maintain \ncertification for 100% of our final assembly sites, including new sites as they\u2019re added.\nWe\u2019ve completed a new waste-reduction pilot program \nfocused on the packaging materials used to ship product parts from suppliers to final assembly sites. We worked with some suppliers to replace shipping materials with reusable and recyclable alternatives and to redesign packaging to use less material overall. For example, for Nest Wifi Pro, we partnered with multiple part suppliers in 2022 to replace an estimated 30 metric tons of plastic with corrugated cardboard, which is easier to recycle. Building on these early successes, we\u2019re now engaging more suppliers and comprehensively reviewing packaging for many more parts across our portfolio, in hopes of identifying more opportunities to achieve even bigger waste reductions.\n2022 HIGHLIGHT\nHalf of our consumer hardware \nfinal assembly sites achieved 100% landfill diversion.\nTARGET\nAchieve UL 2799 Zero Waste \nto Landfill certification at all final assembly consumer hardware manufacturing sites by 2022\n\u20091322022 PROGRESS\nWe achieved UL 2799 Zero \nWaste to Landfill certification at Silver or higher for 90%  of our \nestablished final assembly sites\nDETAILS\nYear set: 2020    |    Base year: N/A    |    Target year: 2022\nScope: All final assembly manufacturing sites globally for Google consumer hardware products  with at least one year of data.Safer chemistry\nWe\u2019re protecting people and the planet through safer \nchemistry and responsible management across our hardware products. The chemical safety of materials plays a role in the impact they can have on natural ecosystems, supply chain workers, and users.\nThrough our Product Restricted Substances Specification  \nand Manufacturer Restricted Substances List, we restrict \nmany hazardous substances and ensure our suppliers have processes in place to detect and prevent them from entering the manufacturing process. We\u2019ve laid  a solid foundation  as we pursue our next level goals in \nsafer chemistry.\nIn 2022, we shared more details about our comprehensive \nResponsible Chemical Management program  that \nincludes assessments, guidance, and training resources to help suppliers better mitigate occupational and environmental risks related to the chemicals they use. Recent initiatives have included in-depth assessment programs with greater levels of detail and transparency, extensive supplier training and guidance materials to more proactively manage risk, and new industry partnerships that al\nlow us to share best practices intended to  \nadvance the industry at large.\nWe continue to enroll suppliers into e-learning courses, \nwhich more than 250 manufacturing suppliers have completed as of the end of 2022\u2014a number that continues growing as we extend trainings to more  supplier personnel.\nWe\u2019re working to eliminate antimicrobials  and use \nsafer flame retardants and solvents across our \nconsumer electronics product portfolio. We\u2019re also collaborating across the industry to find and promote the understanding of safer flame retardants available for the electronics sector. In 2022, we partnered with ChemFORWARD , a trusted nonprofit source for chemical \nhazard data and alternatives, on a proactive approach to assessing chemical safety beyond existing regulatory and industry norms. We\u2019ve commissioned over 100 chemical hazard assessments and are working to make them available to others through the ChemFORWARD platform.\nThe Nest Thermostat is now made with fewer parts  \nfor a less complicated design.   66\n2023 Environmental Report  Enabling others\nThe circular economy requires everyone to participate \nto reach its fullest potential. That\u2019s why we\u2019re focused on sharing insights about our efforts so others can adopt them, and why we invest in creating technologies that enable everyone to have an impact.\nFor example, in 2022, we introduced product features \nthat help people and businesses recycle clothing and other goods, and that help hardware customers keep their products in use longer. We\u2019re also helping to improve recycling through accurate measurement and data-led insights using machine learning. In 2022, we shared details about CircularNet , a set of models that lowers barriers to using AI technology for waste identification. Our goal \nwith CircularNet is to develop a robust and data-efficient model for waste/recyclables detection, which can support the way anyone in the waste management ecosystem can identify, sort, manage, and recycle materials.\nWe also support our partners to help discover, accelerate, \nand scale ecosystem solutions that can benefit everyone tackling waste and reuse challenges. In 2022 and early 2023, we worked to jumpstart partner innovation by launching multiple accelerators focused on circular economy solutions. Additional details can be found in the \nWorking together  and Empowering individuals  sections.\nA Googler swaps out a motherboard at our data center in The Dalles, Oregon. When server parts break,  we first try to repair them. If we can\u2019t, we break them up into raw materials and recycle the components.The journey ahead\nAt Google, we believe that realizing a sustainable world means that we must accelerate the transition to a circular economy  where people, the planet, and businesses thrive. \nThis is a large and complex global challenge, but we\u2019ve \nalways viewed a challenge as an opportunity to be helpful and make things better for everyone. \nWhile we\u2019re excited about our journey to a circular \neconomy, we recognize that we\u2019ll face many challenges along the way. For example:\n\u2022 Recovering and diverting resources from landfills requires robust collection and recycling infrastructure around the world, beyond what exists today.\n\u2022 The lack of financially healthy end markets and local reuse infrastructure for salvaged resources often prevents or prohibits materials from making their way back into the economy.\n\u2022 The circular economy requires better data to enable markets to identify, manage, and value available resources. More and higher-quality data is needed to inform capital investments, infrastructure priorities, business plans, policies, and other interventions.\n\u2022 Accelerating the switch from using single-use plastics to more reusable solutions requires additional innovation with the potential to scale across large real estate portfolios.\n\u2022 We\u2019re exploring the connection between low-GHG construction materials and the circular economy, recognizing that recycled materials often have lower carbon footprints than virgin resources.\n\u2009133The challenge is large, but so is our ambition. We seek \nto enable others to embrace circularity, which is why we share knowledge and insight through research, product examples, and case studies with our partners, customers, and billions of users around the world. Examples include:\n\u2022 Closing the plastics circularity gap\n\u2022 Understanding barriers to electronics recycling\n\u2022 Accelerating commercial deconstruction and reuse  \nOur goal with this work is to accelerate progress towards a fully sustainable technology industry and real estate footprint operating on clean, efficiently used energy and made with safe and circular materials.\nLEARN MORE\n\u2022 How Google is supporting the circular economy\n\u2022 A new accelerator for circular economy startups \nand\u00a0nonprofits\n\u2022 Restricted substances specification   67\n2023 Environmental Report  Nature and  \nbiodiversity\nWe strive to protect and enhance \nnature and biodiversity through \nour campuses and technologyOur ambition\nOur approach\nBuilding for biodiversity\nProtecting nature and \nmaking it more accessible\nSourcing responsiblyDeveloping technology to \naddress biodiversity loss\nThe journey ahead\nOur ambition\nThe world has seen an average loss of 69% of mammal, bird, fish, reptile, and amphibian populations since 1970,\n\u2009134 and \nclimate change, water stress, and resource depletion are only accelerating the stress on our natural environment. Roughly half of global GDP\u2014or $44 trillion\u2014depends on nature and its services, such as healthy soils, flood prevention, clean water, nutrient cycling, pollination, and a stable climate.\n\u2009135 \nPreserving nature is critical both to mitigating climate  \nchange and adapting to it. We want nature and people to flourish together in the communities that Google calls  home, as well as the ecosystems where we source food  for the hundreds of cafes we operate. Our approach\nWe strive to protect and enhance nature and biodiversity through our campuses and technology.\nGoogle has offices in nearly 60 countries around the world \n(as of year-end 2022). In these locations, we aim to protect and enhance nature and biodiversity through a four-pillar approach that starts with building biodiversity at our own office and campus developments, as well as protecting nature and making it more accessible in the surrounding communities where we operate (see Figure 24).\u00a0\nOur approach further focuses on sourcing responsibly \nacross our supply chain. And our billions of users have the potential to have a positive impact on their environments if given the information and tools to do so, so we\u2019re also developing technology to help increase nature\u2019s resilience to climate change.\nFIGURE 24 Our approach to nature and biodiversity\nBuilding for \nbiodiversity\nWe build for biodiversity  \non-site at Google offices \nand campuses by designing \nfor ecology and bringing \nnature back to cities.Protecting nature and \nmaking it more accessible\nIn the Bay Area and elsewhere \nacross our portfolio where \nappropriate, we nurture the \nenvironment and connect  \npeople to nature, both on our  \ncampuses and in the  \nsurrounding communities.Sourcing \nrespo\nnsibly\nWe\u2019re focused on sourcing \nresponsibly across our supply \nchain by procuring sustainable \nbuilding and hardware \nmaterials and supporting \nbiodiverse food systems.Developing technology to \naddress biodiversity loss\nWe\u2019re creating platforms, \nopen tools, and geospatial \nand AI-powered solutions \nthat help to increase nature\u2019s \nresilience to climate change \nand address the causes of \nnature loss.\n   68\n2023 Environmental Report  Building for biodiversity\nCenturies of agricultural intensification and urbanization \nhave transformed landscapes and native habitats around the world, including a loss of over 99% of native habitats in Silicon Valley.\n\u2009136 Google is working to bring nature back into \nthe built environment\u2014in part, by restoring critical habitats like oak woodlands  and willow groves across our Bay \nArea campuses. Our aim is to revive the area\u2019s ecological heritage and bolster the human experience while creating thriving, functional landscapes for a biodiverse constellation of species. In the Bay Area and beyond, wherever possible, we strive to build biodiversity on-site at Google offices and campuses by designing for ecology and bringing nature back to cities.\nDesigning for ecology\nWe increase native, biodiverse habitats on our development sites through both large- and small-scale efforts that prioritize local species. For example, we contributed to the restoration of the Charleston Retention Basin  near our \nBay Area campuses, including nearly 6 acres\n\u2009137 of new and \nenhanced freshwater marsh, native upland, and riparian communities, and we continue to protect a rookery  that\u2019s \nregionally important for the local egret population. In 2022, we created nearly 5 acres of new habitat on our campuses for monarch butterflies and other pollinators.\nAs of the end of 2022, we\u2019ve created and restored  more \nthan 40 acres of habitat on Google\u2019s campuses and \nthe surrounding urban landscape, primarily in the Bay Area\u2014including 17 acres at our Bay View campus. We\u2019ve also planted roughly 4,000 native trees on our Bay Area campuses. In collaboration with local NGOs, ecology experts, and government agencies, this work spans from creating welcoming habitat patches for pollinators to partnering on larger projects like restoring the Charleston Retention Basin. Together, these efforts drive landscape-scale restoration of historical ecosystems like oak woodlands, willow groves, and creek and wetland habitats (see Figure 25).\nFIGURE 25\nHow we\u2019re restoring native habitats in Silicon ValleyWe\u2019ve established  landscape design practices that ensure \necologically-designed landscapes thrive over the long term, primarily through our internal Habitat Design Guidelines. The guidelines help landscape designers leverage plant choices and layout to maximize wildlife habitat value. They include detailed guidelines on native plant palettes, planting structure and density, plant requirements, maintenance requirements, and bird-safe practices. To promote wider use and impact of these guidelines, we sponsored the publication of a public version  that\u2019s freely available for \nlandscape managers in public, private, and NGO settings. In addition, our ecology team also issues guidelines on native landscape maintenance, pollinator habitats, bird bath and nest design, plant pathogen prevention, and recycled water use for native plants. All Bay Area ground-up construction projects completed in 2022 incorporated bird-friendly design elements to reduce the risk of window collisions.\nIn 2022, we opened Bay View , the first major campus \ndesigned by Google, and the most comprehensive \nexample yet of our approach to designing for ecology. Bay View features over 17 acres of high-value natural areas\u2014including wet meadows, woodlands, and a marsh\u2014designed to reestablish native landscapes and rehabilitate Bay Area wetlands . Learn more in our Bay View spotlight .2022 HIGHLIGHT\nAs of the end of 2022, we\u2019ve created \nand restored more than 40 acres of habitat on Google\u2019s campuses and the surrounding urban landscape, primarily in the Bay Area.   69\n2023 Environmental Report  Restoring habitat for \nmonarch butterflies\nWe\u2019re taking steps to help address the threat facing \nCalifornia\u2019s monarch butterflies\u2014pollinators that are important to our ecosystem. In 2020, California only saw 2,000 monarch butterflies during the winter: a more than 90% decline from the millions of monarchs that visited the state in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s.\n\u2009138\nGiven our significant presence in California, in 2021,  \nwe announced  our aim to support the creation, \nrestoration, and/or enhancement of 600 acres of habitat \nfor monarchs  and other pollinators across California, \nincluding creating more habitat on our campuses. We\u2019ve put $500,000 toward this effort on our campuses, and Google.org  granted another $500,000 to the Xerces \nSociety and Peninsula Open Space Trust for habitat work across the state.\nTo date, this has helped to restore and enhance more \nthan 500 acres of monarch and pollinator habitat across California, including creating nearly 5 acres of new habitat on our campuses in 2022.\n2022 HIGHLIGHT\nWe\u2019ve provided grants to help \nrestore and enhance more than  500 acres of monarch and pollinator habitat across California.Bringing nature back to cities\nWe\u2019re also bringing nature back to many cities where we \noperate. Global search interest in     \u201cpollinators \u201d    and   \n   \u201ctree planting \u201d     reached all-time highs in 2022.\u2009139 \nIn urban areas around the world, we\u2019re designing nature into the built environment to improve urban biodiversity and connect people to nature. For example, our Platform G building in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross neighborhood will include \na biodiverse green roof and planting palette designed to support native birds, bats, bees, and insects, designed in collaboration with the London Wildlife Trust. A densely planted outdoor roof garden with a rainwater irrigation system will provide a habitat for protected species of bats and birds, as well as offering a quiet green space for breaks during the work day. We\u2019re collaborating with the London Wildlife Trust as part of a wider initiative to protect our native species and improve local biodiversity.\nIn city centers lacking greenspace, the urban heat island \neffect produces higher temperatures, leading to increased energy needs, air pollution, and heat-related illness.\n\u2009140 \nGoogle is helping to abate the urban heat island effect by prioritizing plantings, green open spaces, and tree canopy cover on our campuses, as well as reducing impermeable surfaces like concrete. \nWe published insights from some of this work in an \nacademic paper , aiming to inspire others and provide them \nwith tools and techniques for integrating nature into dense urban areas. \nA monarch butterfly at our Charleston East campus. (Photo: Rick Miskiv for Google)   70\n2023 Environmental Report  Protecting nature and making it \nmore accessible\nWe recognize that our campus landscapes exist as part \nof greater natural ecosystems, so it\u2019s important that we work to protect and support nature\u2014and make it more accessible to people\u2014both on our campuses and across the broader communities where we operate. In the Bay Area and elsewhere across our portfolio where appropriate, we nurture nature by supporting restoration efforts beyond our campuses and by planning for resilience. We also connect people and nature by providing community access to nature and improving worker health through biophilic design.\nNurturing nature across \necosystems\nWe invest in restoration projects outside of Google\u2019s \ncampuses to build health across the wider ecosystem and accelerate our water stewardship goals. In addition to grants mentioned above to create and maintain pollinator habitat, we also support efforts to strengthen the ecological resilience of critical natural systems like the San Francisco Bay . In 2022, we partnered with the \nSan Francisco Estuary Institute to create the Shoreline Resilience Framework for Wildlife Support , which is being \nused by regional agencies to identify, map, and enhance functions that contribute to shoreline resilience. These functions may include protecting the shoreline from erosion, supporting threatened and endangered species, and maintaining critical landscape processes like marsh migration with sea-level rise.Connecting communities \nand\u00a0nature\nWe invest for the long term, so we want to care for the \nenvironments and communities where we operate. We engage with local communities and leading programming that extends the benefits of nature to all. For example, in partnership with the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society, the City of Mountain View, and other organizations, Google hosts \u201cEgret Office Hours\u201d at the Shorebird Way rookery  so the public can safely see \nmoments throughout the egret breeding cycle. \nAs another example, we created the Green Loop, a \npublicly accessible pedestrian and cycling trail connecting some of our buildings in Mountain View . The Green Loop \nwas designed with native vegetation to enhance habitats for pollinators and other wildlife (including nearly 100 native trees), as well as to help manage stormwater.\nWe ensure that Googlers  have access to the benefits \nof high-quality biodiverse nature through incorporating \nexterior landscapes and access to nature on our campuses, as described above. We also focus on bringing attributes of natural environments into our interior spaces by applying biophilic design practices, such as nature-inspired architecture, interior, and landscape design. To further this, we collaborated on an initiative with the ILFI to make a Biophilic Design Toolkit that was launched in 2022 and is freely available for anyone to use. Some recent buildings that reflect this approach to biophilic design include:\n \u2022 Bay View (Mountain View, CA):  With an abundance of biophilic design elements from natural light to accessible trails, our Bay View campus was a finalist for the 2023 Stephen R. Kellert Biophilic Design Award , presented by ILFI to recognize leading \nexamples of biophilic design in the built environment. Learn more in our Bay View spotlight . \u2022 Pier 57 (New York, NY):  In 2022, we opened Pier 57 in New York City, which incorporates water views and plantings throughout the building to support biophilic design.\n \u2022 Moffett Park (Sunnyvale, CA): In Sunnyvale, we\u2019re building our first ground-up mass timber building , which will incorporate biophilic design \nprinciples by exposing the natural timber structure to building occupants, and by providing abundant views and daylight throughout the interior.\nThe Shorebird Way rookery on our Mountain View, California campus reflects a broader effort to design  \nand build our offices with local environments, ecology, and animal habitats in mind.    71\n2023 Environmental Report  Sourcing \nresponsibly\nWe\u2019re focused on sourcing responsibly across our supply \nchain by procuring sustainable building and hardware materials and supporting biodiverse food systems.\nWe procure building materials for development projects \nand hardware materials for products aiming to minimize negative impacts on global biodiversity. For example, for new campus developments, we\u2019ve incorporated timber certified by the Forest Stewardship Council  (FSC)\u2014the \nworld\u2019s leading forest certification system for sustainable wood building materials. The first time Google led the concept and construction of our own major campuses, Google and our development partners prioritized FSC certification of all new wood purchased and installed, achieving over 96% FSC-certified wood at Bay View.\n\u2009141 \nOur efforts earned us a 2021 FSC Leadership Award, which recognizes excellence in responsible forest management and conservation.\nWe work to ensure our food operations contribute \npositively to global biodiversity. Across our cafes, our Food team is focused on increasing the proportion of agrobiodiverse crops  featured on our menus. We \nleverage procurement practices and menu design to replace monocrop commodities with climate-resilient crops, and jump-start local markets to support agrobiodiversity. In addition to agrobiodiversity, we also support regenerative agriculture practices . This work \nbuilds on the Food team\u2019s vision of helping to feed the world responsibly and sustainably.Developing technology to address \nbiodiversity loss\nWe build tools and technology that enable partners, \nNGOs, governments, and academics around the world to help address nature and biodiversity loss. Our most impactful technology in this area is Google Earth Engine , \na leading technology platform for planetary-scale environmental monitoring such as land use change, the most significant driver of biodiversity loss. Additionally, we\u2019ve helped launch other platforms that help protect nature, such as TraceMark , a sustainable sourcing solution that improves supply chain transparency. We also use AI to help partners unlock new advances, such as our machine learning model that helps the scientific community in detecting humpback whale sounds, or in finding hopeful signs of wildlife recovery  after wildfires.\nWhile supporting expert partners is important, we also believe technology should help everyone do their part for nature and biodiversity. That\u2019s why many of our products aim to engage our users in nature-related tools, product features, and information. For example, Google Shopping restricts the sale and trade of endangered species via content moderation policies. Additionally, we provide free API access to our Maps and Places products for some nature-related uses, such as the iNaturalist app , which \nhelps people learn more about their local environment.\nAdditional details on how we\u2019re developing breakthrough \ntechnologies to address nature and biodiversity loss can be found in the Working together  and Empowering \nindividuals  sections.\nWe\u2019ve incorporated timber certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) in our new campuses developments.   72\n2023 Environmental Report  The journey ahead\nOur approach to protecting nature has important co-\nbenefits. Protecting nature helps sequester carbon, and sequestering carbon helps preserve nature. Water stewardship helps nature thrive, and thriving ecosystems support water stewardship. By promoting circularity, we\u2019re reducing the extraction of natural resources, which in turn protects against environmental degradation\u2014a direct driver of biodiversity loss. For that reason, we\u2019ll seek to evaluate these efforts with a more holistic view.\nWhile we\u2019re excited about our work to protect and \nenhance nature and biodiversity through our campuses and technology, we recognize that we face some challenges, including:\n \u2022 Navigating the local complexities of biodiversity and ecosystem health, as well as forging a broad set of partners to ensure collective action.\n \u2022 Feeding a global workforce responsibly and sustainably while supporting agrobiodiversity and regenerative agriculture practices.\n \u2022 Procuring healthy materials for our campuses and products while encouraging manufacturing partners to embrace responsible material sourcing practices.\n \u2022 Expanding the nature and biodiversity practices that work in one region to more of the areas where we operate around the world.\n \u2022 Effectively measuring nature and biodiversity.Our research papers, articles, and toolkits are intended to help others adopt some of the approaches that have worked for us, from restoring native habitats to integrating nature into cities.\n \u2022 Habitat design guidelines\n \u2022 Biophilic Design Toolkit\n \u2022 Toolkit for supporting nature in cities\n \u2022 Integrating nature into urban areas\nMoving ahead, we\u2019ll continue to build partnerships with others, using lessons from our own efforts alongside new tools and technology to help everyone take action.\nLEARN MORE\n \u2022 Seeding resilience with ecology\n \u2022 Doing our part for California\u2019s monarch butterflies\n \u2022 AI reveals signs of recovery in areas devastated by \nbushfires\n \u2022 Map of Life Indicators adopted in UN Biodiversity Framework\nIn 2022 we opened Pier 57 in New York City, which incorporates water views and plantings throughout the building  \nto support biophilic design.   73\n2023 Environmental Report  SPOTLIGHT\nBuilding a more sustainable \ncampus in Mountain View\nAn interior photo of the canopy ceiling at our Bay View campus. (Photo: Iwan Baan)In 2022, we opened Bay View  in Mountain \nView, California, the first major campus \ndeveloped by Google. From the start,  we had big ambitions  for this project:  \nre-envisioning the workplace with a focus on prioritizing the human experience  and \ncommunity-centered development .\nBay View has now achieved LEED Platinum certification \nand is on track to be the largest project to attain LBC Water Petal Certification, two of the world\u2019s most ambitious building standards. These achievements reflect our goal of building sustainability into everything at Bay View: it integrates low-carbon design, helps regenerate local ecosystems, incorporates circularity principles, and is on track to achieve net water-positive  status.\nNet-zero carbonBay View is a fully electric campus with on-site solar energy and nearby wind farms that are expected to help it operate on 90% clean energy. It features a first-of-its-kind dragonscale solar roof  across all three buildings, \nwhich use the latest building-integrated photovoltaic technology . Unlike a flat roof, where each panel \ngenerates peak power at the same time of the day, the roof\u2019s unique shape enables it to generate power during an extended number of daylight hours.\nTo heat and cool the buildings, Bay View houses an \ninnovative geothermal energy system , which is expected \nto help reduce the building\u2019s carbon emissions compared with a conventional, code-compliant baseline, per our predictive models. This integrated geothermal pile system also enabled us to electrify the building\u2019s overall systems more effectively, because recycling ground heat requires less energy than creating new heat. Bay View also features our largest electric kitchen, through which we\u2019re learning lessons that will inform the transition of all our kitchens to electric cooking.\nWater stewardship\nTo help address local water scarcity, Bay View is on track to meet the LBC\u2019s definition of \u201c net water positive ,\u201d \nmeaning it\u2019s designed to produce more recycled water than the site requires. Predictive models estimate that the on-site geothermal energy system is expected to help reduce about 90% of the water needed for cooling, compared with a traditional cooling tower system. To further reduce water use, we designed the campus landscapes with native plants and drought-tolerant species that don\u2019t require as much watering.\nWe\u2019re also capturing and reusing water on-site when \npossible. Stormwater retention ponds and constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment were integrated into the site landscape. A central plant treats stormwater gathered from retention ponds and wastewater collected from buildings, producing recycled water that can be used for cooling towers, flushing toilets, and irrigation.\nCircular economy\nBay View incorporates our circularity principles  of \nminimizing waste, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and promoting healthy materials  that are safe \nfor people and the environment. We\u2019ve diverted 76%    74\n2023 Environmental Report  of construction waste from landfill, and over 96% of all \nnew timber used in the campus is certified by the FSC,\u2009142 \nearning us a 2021 FSC Leadership Award . We designed \nflexible workspaces, including easily adjustable partition walls, reducing the need for new materials as our needs evolve. And we vetted thousands of materials against the LBC\u2019s \u201cRed List\u201d to avoid toxins and create the healthiest environment possible, from the carpet tiles and paints to the plywood and furniture.\nNature and biodiversity\nBay View is the most comprehensive example yet of our approach to designing for ecology. The site was designed to integrate with the native landscape and regenerate \nlocal ecosystems  such as wetlands. It features over \n17 acres of high-value natural areas\u2014including wet meadows, woodlands, and a marsh.\nThe significant amount of open space was thoughtfully \ndesigned to echo pre-development water flows through stormwater treatment areas, which include open-water ponds that provide a habitat for aquatic wildlife. New willow groves provide a critical habitat for local wildlife and migrating songbirds, which have almost entirely disappeared from the South Bay. Additionally, pollinator gardens help the campus meet the LBC\u2019s urban agriculture criteria, recognizing the key role of native pollinators\u2014such as bees\u2014in local food production and ecosystem health.\nBay View provides Googlers and community members \nwith access to nature through landscape restoration and accessible trail networks. We also applied biophilic design  principles to the interior spaces, aiming to capture \nproven health benefits for workers through approaches such as clerestory windows, which provide access to natural light from every work area. Due to these efforts, Bay View was a finalist for the 2023 Stephen R. Kellert Biophilic Design Award .\nReplicable solutionsFrom the start of this project, we aimed to create shared value  through replicable solutions  and innovations  that \ncould benefit others and drive innovation forward. The dragonscale roof taught us how to integrate solar panels into a building skin in ways that we believe can help standardize this practice. The on-site wastewater treatment system can hopefully make it easier for others in the area to design similar systems by paving the way for local codes to evolve. And our strategies to minimize construction waste involved working closely with manufacturers to reduce packaging, an effort we believe could help others with similar goals. To share our learnings and help raise awareness across the development industry, we released a book  outlining all \nthese innovations, in the hopes of ultimately expanding the impact of this project around the world.\nLEARN MORE\n \u2022 Bay View and Charleston East\n \u2022 Pathways: Unlocking innovation at Bay View \nand Charleston East\nThe outdoor courtyard between two primary buildings at our Bay View campus shows \nGoogle\u2019s focus on connecting employees with nature.

That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots, such as our long-term opportunities in AI. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses\u2014the largest of \nwhich is Google. Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud. Google Services\u2019 core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Our consumer hardware includes Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices. Our Google Cloud offerings include Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace.\nOur headquarters are located in Mountain View, \nCalifornia. We own and lease office facilities and data centers around the world, primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia. To learn more, see our data center locations  and our office\u00a0locations .\nThe Googleplex in Mountain View, California\nSustainability governance\nAlphabet\u2019s Board of Directors has delegated to the Audit and Compliance Committee the primary responsibility for the oversight of many of the risks facing our businesses. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and discusses with management any major risk exposures, including sustainability risks, and the steps that Alphabet takes to detect, monitor, and actively manage such exposures.In 2022, Google evolved its approach to sustainability governance by creating a Sustainability Focus Area, an internal team led by our SVP of Learning and Sustainability that provides centralized management oversight of sustainability and climate-related issues.The Sustainability Focus Area includes the Chief Sustainability Officer and executives from across the company with diverse skills, from teams such as operations, products, finance, marketing, legal, communications, and policy, among others. Through the Sustainability Focus Area, sustainability and climate ambitions are built into our company-wide goals, plans of action, management policies, performance objectives, and how we monitor progress.    77\n2023 Environmental Report  Risk management\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team is responsible \nfor identifying, assessing, and reporting risks related to the company\u2019s operations, financial performance, and reputation. As with financial, operational, and strategic risks, the team assesses environmental risks as part of the company\u2019s overall risk management framework. The risks and opportunities identified through this process support public disclosures and inform Google\u2019s environmental sustainability strategy. Our Chief Sustainability Officer and sustainability teams work to address risks by identifying opportunities to reduce the company\u2019s environmental impacts from its operations and value chain, and through improving climate resilience. \nClimate-related \nrisks\nClimate-related risks and opportunities have long time \nhorizons with high uncertainty regarding how climate trends, policy, and socio-economic factors might evolve in the future. Google continues to build on qualitative and quantitative risk assessments to identify climate-related risks and opportunities, and to understand their associated impact.\nIn 2015, Google developed a set of Principles of Climate \nResilience , which support our definition of climate risk \nand resilience. From there, we created a framework that prioritizes the impact on people (including communities, users, and Googlers), so that it represents the different aspects of climate resilience within Google, as well as the internal and external actors who either influence or are influenced by Google\u2019s climate resilience decisions. These ideas continue to inform how we think about addressing long-term climate risk.\nIn 2020, Google conducted a climate risk assessment, \nwhich included a low and high emissions climate scenario analysis. This assessment modeled the impact of flooding, water stress, extreme heat, and wildfires on 26 priority office sites and 23 data center locations. The key result of this scenario analysis was that increased exposure to extreme heat and flooding is likely to impact many of our global offices and data centers as early as 2030, if not sooner. We consider these results when planning Google\u2019s overall development strategy.\nIn 2022, Google increased its efforts to align our \nclimate risk assessment process more closely with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD), leveraging \nthe TCFD categories of risks and opportunities and conducting climate scenario analyses. In an effort to drive completeness and consistency when reviewing these categories, we adopted our ERM rating scales (i.e., impact, frequency, likelihood, control effectiveness) to identify and prioritize areas of focus.\nIn 2022, climate-related risks and opportunities were \nanalyzed in three time horizons\u2014short term (through 2030), medium term (through 2040), and long term (through 2050)\u2014for financial, operational, legal, and strategic risks. We considered acute and chronic physical risk perils such as heat stress, water stress, hail, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, droughts, wildfires, and wind gusts. We also considered risks associated with transitioning to a low-carbon economy (e.g., energy costs, future regulations, technology, market, and reputational risks, among a few). We also assessed numerous climate-related opportunities such as building and expanding climate solutions to support users\u2019 journeys to a low-carbon world, improving office and data center efficiency, and advancing new energy efficient technologies.\n \nWater-related \nrisks\nTo identify and assess water-related risks in our direct \noperations, Google annually undertakes a water risk assessment to identify priority locations with potential water-related risks that may present opportunities for water stewardship action. Indicators from available risk assessment tools, including WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas 3.0 and WWF Water Risk Filter 6.0, are blended with other metrics to evaluate risks related to scarcity, flooding, water quality, sanitation and hygiene, reputation, and regulatory stressors. \nFor our data center operations specifically, in 2022  \nGoogle finalized the development and application of a context-based water risk and impact methodology to generate more granular insights than can be provided by water risk screening tools. It provides a framework to measure and evaluate site-level water risks, and the potential watershed impact, to inform our decision-making process for new site selection, water cooling design, and ongoing operations.To identify and assess water-related risks in our supply chain, we\u2019ve conducted a supply chain water use analysis and a supplier risk assessment using WRI\u2019s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, WWF\u2019s Water Risk Filter, and WULCA AWARE . The key risks identified included baseline water \nstress, flood risk, access to safe drinking water, and the level of sanitation and hygiene services. This assessment enabled us to identify priority locations for supplier engagement in Central America, Asia, and the United States.\nTo safeguard the health of local waterways, we stipulate \nthat suppliers \u201c[treat water] as required prior to discharge or disposal of all wastewater.\u201d To support the health and wellbeing of those in the communities we operate in, suppliers must \u201cprovide workers with ready access to clean toilet facilities [and] potable water.\u201d We conduct regular supplier audits to monitor adherence to our code of conduct. Additionally, we\u2019ve engaged our suppliers through the CDP Supply Chain Water Security questionnaire, inviting them to disclose their water management efforts.\nThe cooling towers at our Mayes County, Oklahoma data \ncenter help keep our servers running efficiently.   78\n2023 Environmental Report  Stakeholder engagement\nWe believe in the importance of outside perspectives \nto help inform our business decisions. We actively engage with our stakeholders (e.g., employees, NGOs, policymakers, customers, researchers, academics, and investors) throughout the year on a broad range of environmental topics. \nOur engagement enables us to better understand our stakeholders\u2019 perspectives, elaborate on our environmental strategy, and progress against key targets, and it creates a vital two-way dialogue that informs our approach to the work.\nSee below for more information on how we engage \nwith employees, suppliers, policymakers, and partners. For additional information on how we collaborate with customers, researchers, academics, and NGOs, see the Working together  section.\nEmployee \nengagement\nSustainability is part of our culture, and we give our \nemployees opportunities to engage on environmental issues and put their passions into practice.\nTo celebrate Earth Day, we host an annual virtual event \nfor employees to learn more about what Google is doing to empower people to make more sustainable choices, support our partners and customers, and operate our business more sustainably. Throughout the year, we invite thought leaders and experts to speak about the latest sustainability trends, and we post some of these talks publicly on our Talks at Google YouTube channel. Employees can also access online sustainability courses and can join global and local internal community groups focused on sustainability topics. Some employees also take on a 20% project \u2014an opportunity to work \non something outside of their primary role\u2014related to sustainability. One great example of this is Project Sunroof, which began as a 20% project back in 2015. Lastly, employees have the opportunity to learn about sustainability through internal newsletters and education campaigns.\nSupplier \nengagement\nThrough our supplier responsibility  program , we\u2019re \nworking to build an energy-efficient, low-carbon, \ncircular supply chain that makes smart use of the Earth\u2019s resources, protects ecosystems, and helps to combat climate change. We focus on the areas where we can make an immediate and lasting impact, such as helping our suppliers improve their environmental performance and integrate inclusivity, climate resilience, water stewardship, and circular design into our supply chain. We believe these principles can play a key role in reducing environmental impact and protecting human rights and community health.Google\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct includes requirements \nthat enable us to ensure that those we partner with are responsible environmental stewards. Along with having suppliers evaluate their operations, we perform our own ongoing due diligence and audits to verify compliance and to understand our supply chain\u2019s current and potential risks.\nWhen we find that a supplier isn\u2019t complying, we expect \nthat supplier to provide a corrective action plan (CAP) that outlines the root cause of the finding, how and when that company will resolve the issue, and what steps it will take to prevent recurrence. We determine whether the plan is acceptable based on the severity of the noncompliance and the effort and time required to resolve the issue. We expect suppliers to demonstrate improvements to continue working with us. Our goal is to resolve the most severe issues immediately. We expect all other findings to be resolved in accordance with our guidelines as quickly as is practical. While we work with our suppliers to help them address our findings, in some instances, we may decide to no longer pursue a relationship or to terminate our current relationship.\nIn 2022, we audited a subset of our suppliers to verify \ncompliance for the following environmental criteria: implementation of environmental management systems, environmental permits and reporting, product content restrictions, and resource efficiency, as well as management of hazardous substances, wastewater,  solid waste, and air emissions.\nGooglers chat among indoor plants at our Pier 57 office in New York City.   79\n2023 Environmental Report  Public policy and advocacy\nWe know that strong public policy action is critical to \ncreating prosperous, equitable, and resilient low-carbon economies around the world. \nThe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC)\u2019s 2015 Paris Agreement states that humanity must \u201ckeep global temperature rise this century well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\u201d\n\u2009143 Google \nremains unwavering in our commitment to the Paris Agreement, because climate scientists are clear: we have until 2030 to chart a sustainable course for our planet, or we\u2019ll face the worst consequences of climate change.\n\u2009144 \nIn 2022, we saw major steps forward on climate policy in the United States, Europe, and other regions. New policy measures and corporate commitments will continue to play an important role in driving emissions reductions in the next decade. See Figure 26 for our position on climate policy. \nFIGURE 26\nOur position on climate policy\nAt Google, we support public policies that:\n\u2022 Strengthen global climate action efforts through the Paris Agreement, G20, and other multilateralforums to enhance international cooperation on climate.\n\u2022 Establish emissions reduction targets and technology-neutral pathways  to achieve a low-carbon\neconomy in line with the IPCC\u2019s guidance and scientific consensus.\u2009145\n\u2022 Use competitive, interconnected energy markets to empower consumers  and speed up the transition\nto a clean economy.\n\u2022 Accelerate the development and deployment of next generation low-carbon technology , including\nharnessing digital technologies like AI and machine learning to support climate action across businesses,cities, governments, and civil society.\n\u2022 Foster partnerships and deepen collaboration  across public and private actors to enable progress on\nclimate mitigation and adaptation by harnessing the full potential of climate solutions.\n\u2022 Empower everyone to participate in the transition to a sustainable economy and ensure that the cleanenergy economy provides economic growth for all \u2014spurring a new generation of green jobs, benefiting\nthe communities most impacted by a changing climate, and leaving no one behind in the transition.Policy \nengagement\nEngagement on sustainability policy has been a top \npriority at Google for many years. Most recently, we were an official partner at COP-27  in 2022, where we \nparticipated in over 50 events and moments throughout the conference with public sector leaders from the United States, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia to call for amplified ambition on climate and to showcase the role that the technology sector can play in enabling climate mitigation and adaptation.\nWe\u2019ve consistently supported strong climate policies \naround the world in our public policy engagement and advocacy. In 2020, we published a climate change public policy position statement, Realizing a carbon-free future: Google\u2019s Third Decade of Climate Action , expressing \nour support for public policies that strengthen global climate action efforts through the Paris Agreement, establish emissions reduction targets and technology-neutral pathways to achieve a carbon-free economy, and accelerate the development and deployment of next generation low-carbon technology, among other provisions. In the United States, our federal lobbying report covering Q4 2022 includes our lobbying efforts with regard to U.S. federal climate and energy policy, including the Clean Energy for America Act, the CLEAN Future Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, all of which align with our advocacy for ambitious federal climate and clean energy policies.  \nIn Europe, our CEO Sundar Pichai shared virtual remarks at \nour inaugural Google European Sustainability Summit  in Brussels, which brought together policymakers, industry, and civil society to discuss how to accelerate climate action. He said, \u201cAt Google, we share the EU\u2019s commitment to action, and want to be a helpful partner in that progress.\u201d In the Asia-Pacific region, we provided a public submission and statement of support for Australia\u2019s Climate Change Bill 2022 to enable the country to meet its Paris Agreement goals and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\nWe\u2019ve led significant public policy engagement to support \nstrong sustainability outcomes. For instance, in the United States last year, we provided comments  to the SEC\u2019s \nproposed rule  on enhanced climate-related disclosures. \nIn Europe, we shared input with the European Commission to support policy measures to make smartphones and tablets, along with other devices, more repairable and sustainable. We also advocated for measures in the EU Renewable Energy Directive to support 24/7 carbon-free energy supply models that enable companies to source clean energy for their operations. \nSee Figure 27 for a detailed list of our sustainability policy \nengagements in 2022.\nA green wall at our inaugural Google European \nSustainability Summit in Brussels.   80\n2023 Environmental Report  FIGURE 27\nGoogle\u2019s policy engagements in 2022\nGlobal and cross-cutting initiatives\nPolicy Roadmap for \n24/7 Energy PolicyGoogle launched a policy roadmap for 24/7 CFE, laying out a vision for policies that we believe \nare critical to accelerating electricity grid decarbonization, informed by our experience as a \nlarge energy consumer and clean energy purchaser in many different markets around the world. \nThe paper puts forward a detailed policy agenda with three key pillars: 1) rapidly developing and \ndeploying clean energy technologies, 2) expanding and reforming markets to value carbon-free \nenergy and drive innovation, and 3) empowering energy consumers.\nGoogle at COP-27 \nUNFCCC ConferenceGoogle was a financial sponsor of the 2022 Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC,  \nin partnership with the Egyptian government and the United Nations, and sent a delegation led  \nby Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt and VP of Engineering & Research Yossi Matias, along \nwith a number of senior subject matter experts.

Most of our environmental data covers Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiaries, the largest of which is Google. All reported data is global and annual unless otherwise specified. \nData \nmeasurement and\u00a0uncertainty\nAll reported values represent the best data available at time \nof publication. Where actual data isn\u2019t available, we may use estimates. We base our estimates and methodologies on historical experience, available information, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. \nAll environmental data found in this report is subject to \nmeasurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. As we improve our methodologies and as new information becomes available, we may continue to revise our estimates and assumptions. Methodology changes may include changes in a calculation, improvements in the quality of data, new activity types for greater data granularity, and updates to available supplier-reported data. Such updates may result in material changes to our calculations and may also result in adjustments made to the current and previous periods, including our base year. Where material, we\u2019ve disclosed these changes and whether previous periods have been adjusted to reflect these updates.\nAssurance\nWe obtain limited third-party assurance from an independent auditor for certain environmental data, including select GHG emissions, energy, and water metrics as indicated in our E nvironmental data tables  \nbelow. Ernst & Young LLP reviewed these metrics for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. For more details, see our 2022 Independent Accountants\u2019 Review\u00a0Report .\nPrior to fiscal year 2019, another third party verified the following emissions: Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), Scope 2 (location-based), Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting), and biogenic. For more information, see our prior annual Environmental Reports.Methodology\nThe below methodologies apply to our GHG emissions, as well as certain other carbon, energy, and water metrics as presented in our Environmental data tables , focused \nprimarily on those where we have obtained third-party limited assurance. These metrics have been rounded as described below. Due to rounding applied to all reported years of data in our 2023 Environmental Report, some of our reported values for prior years don\u2019t directly match the related Independent Accountants\u2019 Review Reports from those years.\nGreenhouse gas \nemissions\nGHG emissions reporting standards\nGHG emissions are calculated according to the \nGreenhouse Gas Protocol standards and guidance developed by the WRI and the WBCSD, including A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), Scope 2 Guidance, and Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (collectively, \u201cthe Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u201d). \nOur inventory\nWe use the operational control approach to define our organizational boundary, which means that we account for all emissions from operations over which we have control. We define operational control as having the authority to introduce and implement operational policies over an asset, and we report all energy and emissions for Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiaries\u2019 data centers, offices, and other assets under our operational control (\u201cGlobal Facilities\u201d). In September 2022, Google acquired Mandiant, and Mandiant\u2019s emissions are included in our organizational boundary for fiscal year 2022.\nOur Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions include four of the \nseven GHGs addressed by the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO\n2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and \nhydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Other GHGs, including perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\n6), and \nnitrogen trifluoride (NF3), aren\u2019t included in our inventory, \nas they\u2019re not emitted as a result of our operations. Further, in 2022, CO\n2 alone represented over 98% of our \ntotal Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based emissions. We convert all emissions to metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO\n2e) for reporting. All reported values are \nrounded to the nearest hundred, unless otherwise noted.\nWe source the global warming potentials (GWP) for each \nGHG from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Appendix A: Global Warming Potentials.\nScope 1 GHG emissions\nScope 1 GHG emissions are direct emissions from sources such as company vehicles or generators at our offices and data centers. They represent direct emissions from owned Global Facilities, including fuel use from back-up generators, fuel consumption from our operated vehicles and aircraft, methane and nitrous oxide from biogenic fuel sources, natural gas usage, and refrigerant leakage. Where actual data isn\u2019t available, estimated natural gas consumption is calculated using square footage of Global Facilities and internally-developed natural gas intensity    87\n2023 Environmental Report  factors by office type, based on data from the current \nfiscal year. \nBeginning in 2022, in an effort to continuously implement \nbest practice methodologies, we included fugitive \nemissions from refrigerant leakage in our operational \nboundary. These emissions represented approximately \n17% of our 2022 Scope 1 GHG emissions. Where actual \nrefrigerant leakage data isn\u2019t available, we estimate \nrefrigerant leakage using an internally-developed \nglobal warming potential and a leakage rate. We didn\u2019t \nrecalculate our Scope 1 GHG emissions for prior years to \ninclude refrigerant leakage.\nThe emission factors used to calculate Scope 1 emissions \ninclude the 2017 WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Emission \nFactors from Cross Sector Tools, the 2023 EPA Center \nfor Corporate Climate Leadership GHG Emission \nFactors Hub, and the 2022 Department for Environment, \nFood and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) U.K. Government GHG \nConversion\u00a0Factors.\nScope 2 GHG emissions\nScope 2 GHG emissions are indirect emissions from \npurchased electricity, the production of space heating for \nour leased offices, and refrigerant leakage at our leased \noffices. The location-based method reflects the average \ncarbon intensity of the electric grids where our operations \nare located and thus where our electricity consumption \noccurs. The market-based method incorporates our \nprocurement choices, namely our renewable energy \npurchases via contractual mechanisms like power \npurchase agreements (PPAs). \nActual data, such as third-party invoices, is used \nto calculate Scope 2 emissions. Where actual data isn\u2019t available, estimated electricity and natural gas \nconsumption is calculated using square footage of Global \nFacilities and internally developed electricity and natural \ngas intensity factors by office type, based on data from \nthe current fiscal year. \nBeginning in 2022, emissions from estimated refrigerant \nleakage were calculated using an internally-developed \nglobal warming potential and leakage rate. Refrigerant \nleakage included in Scope 2 GHG emissions is immaterial. \nWe didn\u2019t recalculate prior year Scope 2 GHG emissions to \ninclude refrigerant leakage.\nThe emission factors used to calculate Scope 2 (location-\nbased) emissions include the 2017 WRI/WBCSD GHG \nProtocol Emission Factors from Cross Sector Tools, \nthe 2022 IEA Emission Factors, the 2023 EPA eGRID \nEmission Factors, and the 2022 Climate Registry Default \nEmission\u00a0Factors.\nThe emission factors used to calculate Scope 2 (market-\nbased) emissions include the 2017 WRI/WBCSD GHG \nProtocol Emission Factors from Cross Sector Tools, the \n2022 IEA Emission Factors, the 2022 Association for \nIssuing Bodies European Residual Mixes, the 2023 EPA \neGRID Emission Factors, the 2022 Climate Registry Default \nEmission Factors, and emission factors specific to energy \nattribute certificates. The adjusted emission factors from \nthe Association for Issuing Bodies European Residual \nMixes are used for European facilities. Outside of Europe, \nadjusted emission factors aren\u2019t available to account for \nvoluntary purchases.Scope 3 GHG emissions\nScope 3 GHG emissions are indirect emissions from \nother sources in our value chain, such as our suppliers, \nuse of our consumer hardware products, and business \ntravel. We estimate our Scope 3 GHG emissions using \nthe the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s Technical Guidance \nfor Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0), in the \nfollowing categories identified as relevant: \n\u2022 Category 1: Purchased goods and services\n\u2022 Category 2: Capital goods\n\u2022 Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution\n\u2022 Category 6: Business travel\n\u2022 Category 7: Employee commuting, including \nteleworking\n\u2022 Category 11: Use of sold products\n\u2022 Category 12: End-of-life treatment of sold products\nIn our Environmental data tables , we present certain \nemissions from Category 1, Category 2, Category 11, \nnd Category 12 as an aggregated subtotal\u2014\u201cOther \ncategories\u201d\u2014for business reasons, as described further \nbelow.\nOur Operational Scope 3 emissions are made up of \nCategory 6 and Category 7, and are third-party assured. \nAll reported Scope 3 emissions values are rounded to the \nnearest thousand.\nCategory 1: \u201cPurchased goods and services\u201d includes \nemissions generated from manufacturing consumer \nhardware and our food program. To estimate full supply \nchain emissions generated from manufacturing consumer \nhardware, we perform third-party-verified Life Cycle \nAssessments (LCAs) in accordance with ISO 14040 and \n14044. For our food program, we use LCA emission factors from WRI and annual Bay Area procurement \nvolumes to estimate emissions, which we extrapolate to \nour global operations using building admittances.\nIn our Environmental data tables , emissions from \nmanufacturing consumer hardware products are \npresented in Category 2: \u201cCapital goods.\u201d Emissions from \nour food program are presented in \u201cOther categories.\u201d\nCategory 2: \u201cCapital goods\u201d  includes upstream \nemissions from the production of capital goods \nwe\u2019ve purchased, including computing and storage \nhardware used in our data centers. This category also \nincludes emissions from data center construction. For \nmanufacturing of capital goods, we collect supplier \nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions data directly from our \nhardware contract manufacturers, component suppliers, \nand fabless suppliers through the CDP Supply Chain \nProgram; these suppliers represent our key \u201cTier 1\u201d \nhardware manufacturing suppliers with whom we have \na direct relationship. Where supplier emissions data \nisn\u2019t available, we estimate with industry-average GHG \nintensities by commodity type and spend data. Data \ncenter construction emissions are estimated by using an \nLCA analysis to derive construction emissions data and \nthen applying this to our construction activity. \nIn our Environmental data tables , emissions from our \nTier 1 hardware manufacturing suppliers are presented in \nCategory 2: \u201cCapital goods,\u201d and emissions beyond our \nTier 1 hardware manufacturing suppliers are presented in \n\u201cOther categories.\u201d Data center construction emissions \nare presented in \u201cOther categories.\u201d\nCategory 4: \u201cUpstream transportation and \ndistribution\u201d includes emissions generated primarily \nfrom transportation and warehousing of our consumer    88\n2023 Environmental Report  products and data center equipment. We collect \nconsumer products and data center equipment \ntransportation emissions from our logistics providers. \nThese well-to-wheel (WTW) GHG emissions are \ncalculated based on fuel use or weight-distance data \nand routing associated with a shipment. Where logistics \nprovider emissions data isn\u2019t available, we use weight \nand distance data by shipment collected from the \nproviders to estimate WTW emissions, using emissions \nfactors from the 2019 Global Logistics Emissions Council \n(GLEC) framework. Where logistics provider data isn\u2019t \navailable, emissions are estimated based on reported \ndata from other transportation providers and the number \nof units shipped. For warehousing emissions, we collect \nenergy data directly from the warehouses and estimate \nemissions using LCA electricity and fuel factors from \nthe 2022 Sphera LCA for Experts database. Where \nwarehouse energy data isn\u2019t available, we estimate using \nthe 2018 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption \nSurvey (CBECS) data and the warehouse square footage \nallocated to Alphabet.\nCategory 6: \u201cBusiness travel\u201d includes emissions from \nair, rail, and car rental travel. Distance and fuel-based \ntravel data is collected through our online booking system \nor through a third-party travel agency for all sources. \nData obtained from our value chain partners isn\u2019t used at \nthis time. Emissions are calculated using 2022 DEFRA U.K. \nGovernment GHG Conversion Factors for air travel, the \n2017 WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Emission Factors from \nCross Sector Tools for rail travel, and the 2023 EPA Center \nfor Corporate Climate Leadership GHG Emission Factors \nHub for car rental travel. \nCategory 7: \u201cEmployee commuting, including \nteleworking\u201d includes emissions from the transport of \nour full-time employees between their homes and their worksites by private vehicle, public transit, motorcycle, \nand gas-powered scooter commuting trips. To determine \nthe number of commuting trips by mode made in 2022, we \nsurveyed our employees to determine typical commuting \npatterns and applied these commuting patterns to our \nglobal employee population. The calculation uses an \naverage commuting distance for passenger vehicles \nobtained from the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s \n2017 National Household Travel Survey and an average fuel \nefficiency for passenger vehicles obtained from the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation\u2019s Transportation Statistics \nTable 4\u201323. Data obtained from our value chain partners \nisn\u2019t used at this time. Emissions are calculated using \n2022 DEFRA U.K. Government GHG Conversion Factors \nfor passenger vehicles. This category also includes \nteleworking emissions, which we began to estimate and \nreport in 2020, when teleworking became prevalent due \nto the global pandemic. Teleworking represents emissions \ngenerated by employees working remotely from their \nhomes. We apply the estimation methodology outlined in \nEcoAct\u2019s 2020 Homeworking Emissions white paper to our \nannual average workforce in 2022.\nCategory 11: \u201cUse of sold products\u201d includes emissions \ngenerated by all of Google\u2019s flagship consumer hardware \nproducts sold in 2022. Flagship consumer hardware \nproducts are products that can provide their main \nfunctionality without connection to another product. For \nexample, this doesn\u2019t include accessories, such as cases. \nUse impact was calculated using laboratory power draw \nmeasurements, data on use patterns, common industry \nassumptions on product lifetimes, and LCA electricity \nemission factors from the 2022 Sphera LCA for Experts \ndatabase. In our Environmental data tables , emissions \nfrom use of sold products are presented in \u201cOther \ncategories.\u201dCategory 12: \u201cEnd-of-life treatment of sold products\u201d \nincludes GHG emissions associated with the end-of-life \ntreatment of all of Google\u2019s flagship consumer hardware \nproducts sold in 2022. End-of-life impact was calculated \nthrough our LCA process using emission factors from \nthe 2022 Sphera LCA for Experts database. Our initial \nassessments identify this category to be one that doesn\u2019t \nhave significant life-cycle impact. We continue to develop \nprograms to extend the life of our sold products and also \nto ensure efficient management of end-of-life materials. \nIn our Environmental data tables , emissions from end-of-\nlife treatment of sold products are presented in \u201cOther \ncategories.\u201d\nIn 2022, we revised our methodology to calculate \nemissions related to our consumer hardware \nmanufacturing, as we updated from a spend-based \nmethodology to a Life Cycle Assessment-based \nmethodology. We also made improvements to the quality \nof data used in estimating our emissions associated \nwith manufacturing our data center hardware, as well \nas the LCAs and LCA emission factors used to calculate \nemissions related to data center construction. We didn\u2019t \nrecalculate prior year Scope 3 GHG emissions to reflect \nthese changes.\nBiogenic emissions\nIn accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, \nbiogenic emissions are reported separately from \nother Scope 1 GHG emissions. These CO2 emissions \nare generated from our operated vehicles consuming \nbiofuels. Biogenic emissions are calculated using emission \nfactors from the 2023 EPA Center for Corporate Climate \nLeadership GHG Emission Factors Hub.Emissions reductions and \ncompensations\nWe calculate our total operational emissions by summing \nScope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), Scope 3 (Category \n6: Business travel), and Scope 3 (Category 7: Employee \ncommuting, including teleworking), per the criteria \ndescribed above. This market-based subtotal has been \nreduced by the impact of renewable energy procurement \nvia PPAs and market-based emission factors. \nOur operational emissions are then further compensated \nfor by high-quality carbon credits enabled through \ncontracted carbon offset projects, which capture and \ndestroy highly potent GHGs. A carbon offset project is \nan activity that reduces GHG emissions or captures GHG \nemissions from the atmosphere, ultimately represented \nby a carbon credit. The carbon credit signifies that \nGHG emissions are lower than if no one had invested \nin the project. One carbon credit equals one metric ton \nof carbon dioxide equivalent prevented from entering \nthe atmosphere. We assess these projects against \nfour standards before investing: additionality, leakage \nprevention, permanence, and verifiability. \nWe primarily enter into long-term purchase agreements \nwith carbon credit suppliers to secure future deliveries. \nOnce carbon credits from a project under contract \nare verified by a third-party and issued by a carbon \nregistry, per the agreement terms, ownership of the \ncarbon credits is transferred from the project owner to \nGoogle. Our carbon credits are verified under the Climate \nAction Reserve (CAR), American Carbon Registry (ACR), \nVerified Carbon Standard (VCS), or the UNFCCC Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism.   89\n2023 Environmental Report  All carbon credits are retired on a public registry after \nthey\u2019re delivered to us. Due to the timing of third-party \nverifications, delivery and retirement for some 2022 \ncarbon credits occurs after the year ended December \n31, 2022. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol states that a \nGHG target can be met through using credits that are \ngenerated from GHG reduction projects at sources \nexternal to the (company\u2019s) boundary. They\u2019re designed \nto be interchangeable globally and deliverable from a \nvariety of project types. Refer to our Google\u2019s Carbon \nOffsets: Collaboration and Due Diligence white paper \nfor additional information. The quantity of carbon credits \nenabled through contracted projects is subject to the \nlimited assurance procedures noted above; however, the \nquality of our projects and the related due diligence isn\u2019t \nsubject to the limited assurance procedures.\nOther carbon and \nenergy metrics\nOur carbon intensity metrics  are calculated as defined \nby GRI Disclosure 305-4a-c. Carbon intensity metrics are \nbased on gross global combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 \n(market-based) emissions. Reported carbon intensity per \nunit of revenue and per full-time equivalent (FTE) employee \nvalues are rounded to the nearest hundredth, and reported \ncarbon intensity per MWh of energy consumed values are \nrounded to the nearest ten thousandth.\nTotal energy consumption  is calculated as defined \nby GRI Disclosure 302-1e-f. Total energy consumption \nincludes all fuel and natural gas consumption, purchased \nelectricity, purchased heating, and all electricity \ngenerated on-site from renewable sources. Total \nelectricity consumption is calculated as defined by GRI Disclosure 302-1c(i) and 302-1f, and includes both \npurchased and self-generated electricity. Where actual \nelectricity consumption for facilities isn\u2019t available, we \nestimate consumption using company square footage and \ninternally developed electricity intensity factors based on \nfiscal year 2022 data.\nElectricity purchased from renewable sources (%) is \ncalculated on a calendar-year basis, dividing the volume \nof renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for \nour global operations (i.e., renewable energy procured \nthrough our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy \ngeneration, and renewable energy in the electric grids \nwhere our facilities are located) by the total volume of \nelectricity consumed by our global operations. This metric \nincludes all renewable energy purchased, regardless of \nthe market in which the renewable energy was consumed.\nGoogle currently purchases enough renewable energy  \nto match our annual global electricity consumption.  \nTo achieve our 100% renewable energy match  goal, \nwe first consider both our on-site renewable energy \ngeneration and the renewable energy that\u2019s already in the \nelectric grids where our facilities are located, then procure \nrenewable energy through PPA agreements and utility \nrenewable energy tariffs. We have a few facilities located \nin geographies where we\u2019re not currently able to source \nlarge volumes of renewable energy, so we currently \nmake up for this by buying surplus renewable energy \nin regions where it\u2019s abundant. For example, by buying \nlarger amounts of wind energy in places like Europe, we \ncompensate for our lack of renewable energy purchases \nin Asia. This approach results in our Scope 2 market-based \nemissions being greater than zero, per the Greenhouse \nGas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, despite us achieving our \n100% renewable energy match globally.Water metrics\nWe report all water metrics for Alphabet Inc. and its \nsubsidiaries\u2019 data centers, offices, and other assets under \nour operational control. \u201cWater consumption\u201d  is equal \nto (\u201cWater withdrawal\u201d \u2013 \u201cWater discharge\u201d). Our \nreported water consumption, water withdrawal, and water \ndischarge metrics don\u2019t include seawater. Water metrics \nare rounded to the nearest hundred thousand gallons and \nare reported in million gallons. \nWater withdrawal data is based on actual metered \nor invoiced data when it\u2019s available. At offices where \nmetered or invoiced data isn\u2019t available, water withdrawal \nis estimated using facility square footage and internally \ndeveloped water withdrawal intensity factors by office \ntype based on fiscal year data. In all instances where \nactual potable water discharge isn\u2019t available, we apply a \n90% discharge flow factor to the facility water withdrawal \nto estimate water discharge. For irrigation water, we apply \na 0% discharge flow factor to the facility water withdrawal \nto estimate water discharge. This estimation process is \napplicable to all offices and to potable and irrigation water \nwithdrawal at data centers used for domestic purposes \n(i.e., water not used for IT cooling) where actual discharge \nisn\u2019t available.Forward-looking \ninformation\nReferences to information in this report should not be \nconstrued as a characterization regarding the materiality \nof such information to our financial results or our \noperations.

We\u2019ve formally \nexpressed support  for the TCFD reporting framework and its seven principles for climate disclosure, and we believe that our voluntary disclosures on climate-related matters are consistent with the recommendations of the TCFD framework. \nEvery year since 2009, we\u2019ve publicly reported our \ncarbon footprint to CDP  (formerly known as the \nCarbon Disclosure Project). Since 2014, Alphabet has been included on CDP\u2019s Climate Change A-list eight times, demonstrating our continued commitment to transparency and climate reporting. For our most recent CDP Climate Change Response, see our sustainability reports  page. \nClimate transition plan\nIn this report, we\u2019ve outlined elements of our climate transition plan that will help us make progress toward our net-zero ambitions. This includes information about our GHG emissions, science-based emissions reduction target, emissions reduction initiatives, low-carbon products and services, value chain engagement, policy advocacy and engagement, climate risk assessment, and governance mechanisms. \nTo see where elements of our climate transition plan \ncan be found, see report locations marked with (\n)  \nin the tables below.  \nGENERAL Frameworks\nEnvironmental disclosure \ncategoryTopic 2023 Environmental Report location CDP Climate TCFD SASB\nStrategy and governanceStatement from senior decision-maker \u2022 Introduction - Executive letters C16.

We identify the route that we predict will consume the \nleast amount of fuel or energy. If this route isn\u2019t already the fastest one and \nit offers meaningful energy and fuel savings with only a small increase in \ndriving time, we recommend it to the user. To calculate enabled emissions \nreductions, we tally the fuel usage from the chosen fuel-efficient routes \nand subtract it from the predicted fuel consumption that would have \noccurred on the fastest route without eco-friendly routing and apply \nadjustments for factors such as: CO2e factors, fleet factors, well-to-wheels \nfactors, and powertrain mismatch factors. We then input the estimated \nprevented emissions into the EPA\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies \nCalculator  to calculate equivalent cars off the road for a year. The 2022 \nfigure covers estimated emissions prevented after eco-friendly routing was \nlaunched, from October 2021 through December 2022. Enabled emissions \nreductions estimates include inherent uncertainty due to factors that \ninclude the lack of primary data and precise information about real-world \nactions and their effects. These factors contribute to a range of possible \noutcomes, within which we report a central value.\n4 This estimated spend is based on contracts signed to purchase clean \nenergy for our operations. Actual spend may vary from these estimates \nbased on changes in renewable electricity output from operational \nprojects, the number of contracts signed, and energy market prices.\n5 See endnote 3 above.\n6 Estimated energy savings are calculated based on the typical percentage \nof heating and cooling savings found in real-world studies of the Nest \nLearning Thermostat. To calculate the total Nest savings, we apply these \nsavings percentages to the actual heating and cooling hours of all Nest \nthermostats.\n7 \u201cPortugal - Countries & Regions ,\u201d IEA, 2021. \n8 The enabled emissions reductions are calculated based on these energy \nsavings, applying standard emission factors for fossil fuels, and using U.S. \nEPA AVERT marginal emissions for the 95% of electricity savings that occur \nin the U.S., with an adjusted value for the 5% of electricity savings outside \nthe U.S.\n9 For products launched in 2022: Pixel, Nest, and Chromecast devices are \nmade with recycled materials ranging between 9% and 60% based on \nrespective product weights.\n10 Unique, signed-in Google users that were provided information to make a \nmore sustainable choice by at least one sustainable product feature.\n11 Due to a methodology change, we\u2019re not reporting a percent progress \ntowards this target and have instead provided our total GHG emissions \n(Scope 1, 2 (market-based), and 3) in 2022.\n12 In 2022, we expanded our carbon-free energy reporting from only \nGoogle-owned and -operated data centers to also incorporate offices and third-party data centers. The 2022 data center CFE number represents a \n2% change from 2021 (66% CFE), as a result of including third-party data \ncenters.\n13 Based on Google Trends data as of December 2022, when comparing \nglobal Google Search interest since 2004.\n14 See endnote 3 above.\n15 See endnote 6 above.\n16 See endnote 7 above.\n17 See endnote 8 above.\n18 Based on Google\u2019s analysis of traffic patterns before and after \nrecommended adjustments to traffic signals that were implemented during \ntests conducted in 2022.\n19 According to Google\u2019s own analysis of our more efficient servers, power \ninfrastructure, and cooling systems, compared with data center industry \naverages.\n20 According to Google\u2019s platform-neutral measurement for central \nprocessing unit (CPU) resources analyzed over a five-year period.\n21 For more information on how we\u2019re reducing the environmental footprint of \nour operations, see the Operating sustainably  section.\n22 \u201cJapan\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Rose 2% in FY21/22 as Economy \nRecovered ,\u201d Reuters, April 2023. \n23 See endnote 13 above.\n24 \u201cNet Zero by 2050 - A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector ,\u201d IEA, October \n2021.\n25 \u201cCO 2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions ,\u201d OurWorldInData.org, 2020.\n26 Based on Google Trends data as of December 2022, when comparing \nglobal Google Search interest since 2013.\n27 See endnote 13 above.\n28 See endnote 6 above.\n29 See endnote 7 above.\n30 See endnote 8 above.\n31 See endnote 6 above. \n32 Nest Renew Energy Shift usage reflects the total number of hours \nthermostats enrolled in Nest Renew ran Energy Shift features to prioritize \ncleaner or cheaper energy during 2022.\n33 Nest Renew users include anyone in the continental U.S. with a 3rd \ngeneration Nest Learning Thermostat, the Nest Thermostat E, or the \nnewest Nest Thermostat connected to a Google account.\n34 See endnote 6 above.\n35 Based on Google Trends data as of December 2022, when comparing \nglobal Google Search interest since 2008.\n36 See endnote 13 above.\n37 See endnote 35 above.\n38 \u201cTransport: Improving the Sustainability of Passenger and Freight \nTransport ,\u201d IEA, 2022.\n39 Based on Google Trends data as of April 2023, when comparing global \nGoogle Search interest from April 2022\u2013April 2023 to that of April 2021\u2013\nApril 2022.\n40 See endnote 3 above.\n41 \u201cGlobal EV Outlook 2023 Abstract ,\u201d IEA, April 2023.\n42 See endnote 13 above.\n43 Based on Google Trends data as of April 2023, when comparing global \nGoogle Search interest from April 2020\u2013April 2023 to that of April 2017\u2013\nApril 2020.\n44 See endnote 13 above.\n45 Based on Google Trends data as of April 2023, when comparing global Google Search interest since 2004.\n46 See endnote 35 above.\n47 See endnote 43 above.\n48 See endnote 35 above.\n49 \u201cMeasuring Fashion: Environmental Impact of the Global Apparel and \nFootwear Industries Study ,\u201d Quantis, 2018.\n50 \u201cDigital Transformation ,\u201d UNEP, April 2022.\n51 \u201cDigital Decarbonisation: How the Digital Sector is Supporting Climate \nAction ,\u201d Implement Consulting Group, 2022.\n52 \u201c68% of the World Population Projected to Live in Urban Areas by 2050, \nSays UN ,\u201d United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, May \n2018.\n53 SDG Indicators , United Nations: Unstats, 2022.\n54 \u201cIzmir Sustainable Energy Climate Action Plan ,\u201d AECOM, 2020.\n55 See endnote 18 above.\n56 \u201cSpreading Like Wildfire: The Rising Threat of Extraordinary Landscape \nFires ,\u201d UNEP, 2022. \n57 Our \u201cDeep Learning for High-Resolution Wildfire Modeling \u201d research was \npresented at the 2022 International Conference for Forest Fire Research .\n58 \u201cNumber of deaths due to floods worldwide from 1960 to 2020 ,\u201d Statista, \nApril 2023.\n59 \u201cPartnering with Member States ,\u201d UNEP, 2021.\n60 Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index , 2021.\n61 \u201cRetail Speaks ,\u201d McKinsey & Company, 2021.\n62 \u201cFeasibility of Afforestation as an Equitable Nature-Based Solution in Urban \nAreas ,\u201d Sustainable Cities and Society , vol. 81, June 2022 .\n63 Based on Google Trends data as of December 2022, when comparing \nglobal Google Search interest in 2022 to that of 2021.\n64 See endnote 35 above.\n65 Some of our locations have more than one data center campus, and others \nweren\u2019t yet operational during 2022.\n66 \u201cClimate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability \nWorking Group II Contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report of the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ,\u201d IPCC, 2022.\n67 \u201cClimate Commitments Not On Track to Meet Paris Agreement Goals \nas NDC Synthesis Report is Published ,\u201d United Nations Climate Change, \nFebruary 2021.\n68 \u201cIs Carbon Capture Too Expensive?

A PUE of \n2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed \nto cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means \nnearly all the energy is used for computing.\n77 According to the Uptime Institute\u2019s 2022 Global Data Center Survey , the \nglobal average PUE of respondents\u2019 data centers was around 1.55.\n78 See endnote 19 above.\n79 Trailing 12-month PUE consists of the average PUE for the previous 12 \nmonths.\n80 Data from reported ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States and \nCanada only are used to estimate emissions prevented from employee EV \ncommuting.\n81 Based on data collected from shuttle commuting trips in the Bay Area, \nas compared to a scenario in which these employees had each used a \nprivate, fuel-based car for commuting. Assumptions include average \nGoogler commute distance, miles per gallon assumptions from the Bureau \nof Transportation, and emissions per gallon of fuel assumptions from the \nGreenhouse Gas Protocol. Equivalency estimate is based on workdays in \nthe year, using data from \u201c Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator ,\u201d U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, accessed 2022.\n82 See endnote 81 above.\n83 Carbon-free energy is any type of electricity generation that doesn\u2019t \ndirectly emit carbon dioxide, including (but not limited to) solar, wind, \ngeothermal, hydropower, and nuclear. Sustainable biomass and carbon \ncapture and storage (CCS) are special cases considered on a case-by-case \nbasis, but are often also considered carbon-free energy sources.\n84 Alphabet\u2019s renewable energy methodology is a custom calculation and is \nbased on a global approach. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated \non a calendar-year basis, dividing the volume of renewable electricity \n(in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations (i.e., renewable \nenergy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy \ngeneration, and renewable energy in the electric grids where our facilities \nare located) by the total volume of electricity consumed by our global \noperations. The numerator includes all renewable energy procured, \nregardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed. \nAdditional details on Alphabet\u2019s criteria and methodology can be found in  \nthe \u201c Achieving Our 100% Renewable Energy Purchasing Goal and Going \nBeyond \u201d disclosure.\n85 For example, research by Princeton University  and TU Berlin has shown that \nhourly (24/7) carbon-free energy goals have a greater impact on grid-level \ndecarbonization than the prevailing approach of 100% annual renewable \nenergy matching.\n86 See endnote 4 above.\n87 See endnote 4 above.\n88 \u201cGreenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator ,\u201d EPA, accessed 2022.\n89 Our CFE percentage measures the degree to which our electricity \nconsumption on a given regional grid is matched with CFE on an hourly \nbasis. This is calculated using both CFE under contract by Google as well \nas CFE coming from the overall grid mix. CFE coming from the overall grid \nmix is based on data obtained from a third party, Electricity Maps, and has \nnot been assured. For more information, see our 2021 white paper, \u201c 24/7 \nCarbon-Free Energy: Methodologies and Metrics .\u201d\n90 A grid region (or regional grid) corresponds to the area over which a \nsingle entity manages the operation of the electric power system and \nensures that demand and supply are finely balanced. In the United States, \nthis generally means the ISO or RTO in regions that have these regional    102\n2023 Environmental Report  market structures. If no such structure exists, then Google defines the grid \nregion as the electricity-balancing authority where our data centers are \nlocated. Outside of the United States, the grid region most often refers to \nthe geographic boundary of a country, because most grid system operators \noperate at the national level. Certain regions that span multiple countries \nare well interconnected and could be considered as one grid; however, \nour grid mix calculations already include import and export considerations \nand therefore take into account power flows from neighboring grids. In \nthe future, we may update our definition as we work with grid operators to \nbetter understand how transmission constraints or congestion impact CFE \nmeasurement within and across grid regions.\n91 Contracted CFE is the hourly electricity production from clean energy \nprojects whose electricity and associated environmental attributes are \ncontracted to Google via power purchase agreements, retail energy supply \narrangements, or other contractual structures.

All \nreported Scope 3 emissions values are rounded to the nearest thousand.\n147 In 2022, we included estimates for hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions \nresulting from the leakage of refrigerants from cooling equipment at our \noffices and data centers in our Scope 1 emissions. We have not updated \nprior years to include estimated refrigerant emissions.\n148 Our Scope 2 market-based emissions increased 37%, primarily due to \nincreased data center electricity consumption and a lack of full regional \ncoverage of renewable energy procurement in the United States and Asia \nPacific regions.\n149 Certain Category 1: \u201cPurchased goods and services\u201d emissions are \npresented in Category 2: \u201cCapital goods.\u201d See the Methodology  section \nfor more details.\n150 In 2022, we updated our Scope 3 Category 7: \u201cEmployee commuting\u201d \nmethodology to estimate additional modes of transportation due to the \navailability of new data sources. See the Methodology  section for more \ndetails.\n151 We present certain Scope 3 emissions from Category 1, Category 2, \nCategory 11, and Category 12 as an aggregated subtotal \u201cOther categories\u201d \nfor business reasons, as described further in the Methodology  section.\n152 Other GHGs, including perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), \nand nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), are not included in our inventory, as they\u2019re not emitted as a result of our operations.\n153 \u201cTotal renewable energy allocated\u201d includes the total amount of renewable \nelectricity generation conveyed via contractual instruments, which have \nbeen used in the calculation of Scope 2 market-based emissions per the \nGreenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Quality Criteria.\n154 Reported energy values (in MW or MWh) are rounded to the nearest 100.\n155 \u201cPurchased electricity\u201d is electricity sourced from an electrical grid and \npurchased from a local electric utility company. This metric differs slightly \nfrom \u201cTotal electricity consumption,\u201d which includes both purchased and \nself-generated electricity.\n156 See endnote 155 above.\n157 See the Methodology  section for an overview of our \u201cpercentage of \nelectricity procured from renewable sources\u201d calculation.\n158 We report individual campus PUE only for campuses with at least twelve \nmonths of data. All reported PUE values are rounded to the hundredths place.\n159 See endnote 76 above.\n160 See endnote 89 above.\n161 See endnote 12 above.\n162 See endnote 90 above.\n163 See endnote 90 above.\n164 Reported waste generated values are rounded to the nearest hundred.\n165 Landfill diversion is calculated as waste diverted to a more sustainable \npathway than landfill, as a percentage of total waste. Starting in 2022, we\u2019ve \nupdated our landfill diversion rate methodology for our office operations by \nremoving contamination from our recycling and compost streams, providing \na more accurate representation of landfill avoidance, and supporting our \nefforts to maintain high-quality diverted materials.\n166 We expanded this data center hardware refurbishment key performance \nindicator from including only decommissioned parts that were reused for \nserver maintenance to also including other refurbished part types reused for \nserver maintenance as well as server deployment and upgrades. This change \nmore accurately reflects Google\u2019s approach to data center material reuse.\n167 All reported water values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand \ngallons and reported in million gallons.\n168 In 2019, we aligned our water reporting with industry standards to disclose \nthree water indicators: total water withdrawal, consumption, and discharge. \nData for total water consumption and total water discharge is not available \nfor prior years. Our reported water metrics don\u2019t include seawater.\n169 We contracted a third party to quantify volumetric benefits by applying \nindustry standard methodologies and defensible data and assumptions.  \nSee the Benefiting watersheds and communities  section for more details.\n170 Our reported water metrics don\u2019t include seawater. All reported water \nvalues are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand gallons and reported in \nmillion gallons.\n171 Treated wastewater from the Sweetwater Creek Sidestream Reuse Facility.\n172 Air-cooled facility; no water used for cooling.\n173 Industrial water supplied by North Water.\n174 See endnote 98 above.\n175 See endnote 170 above.\n176 Water drawn from the Nimy-Blaton-Peronnes shipping canal and treated \non-site.\n177 See endnote 172 above.\n178 See endnote 98 above.   103\n2023 Environmental Report  Glossary\nAI: artificial intelligence\nBay View: our Bay View campus in Mountain View, \nCalifornia\nCDP:  formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project\nCDR:  carbon dioxide removal\nCFE:  carbon-free energy\nCO2e: carbon dioxide equivalent\nEIE:  Environmental Insights Explorer\nEPA:  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\nESG:  environmental, social and governance\nEV: electric vehicle\nft: foot\nFSC:  Forest Stewardship Council\nGHG:  greenhouse gas\nGHGP:  Greenhouse Gas Protocol\nGT: gigaton\nGW:  gigawatt\nGWP:  global warming potential\nIEA:  International Energy Agency\nILFI:  International Living Future Institute\nIPCC:  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\nISO:  International Organization for Standardization\nkg: kilogram\nkm:  kilometer\nkWh:  kilowatt-hourlb: pound\nLBC:  Living Building Challenge\nLCA:  life cycle assessment\nLEED:  Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design\nm: meter\nML:  machine learning\nMW: megawattMWh:  megawatt-hour\nNGO:  non-governmental organization\nPPA:  power purchase agreement\nPUE:  power usage effectiveness\nSDGs:  Sustainable Development Goals\ntCO\n2e: metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nTCFD:  Task Force on Climate-Related Financial \nDisclosuresTWh:  terawatt-hour\nWBCSD:  World Business Council for Sustainable \nDevelopmentWRI:  World Resources Institute\nUNEP:  United Nations Environment Programme\nUNFCC:  United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate ChangeX: Alphabet\u2019s \u201cmoonshot factory\u201dPhoto details\nOn the cover: \nGoogle Earth image of Soalala, Madagascar \u00a92015 DigitalGlobe\nTable of contents: \nNorther Offshore wind farm in Belgium (92 MW for Google)\nIntroduction:  \nGooglers in a courtyard at our new campus in Mountain View, California.\nA letter from our Chief Sustainability Officer:  \nPhoto by Vaughn Ridley/Sportsfile for Web Summit via Getty Images\nEmpowering individuals:  \nA parking lot full of electric vehicles lined up outside a Google office, \nplugged into charging stations.\nWorking together:  \nSatellite-derived Earth Engine image showing seasonal agricultural peaks \nnear the Columbia and Snake Rivers in Washington state.
