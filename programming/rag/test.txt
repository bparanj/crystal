As can be learned from his biograph y, Genrich
Altshuller analyzed thousands of worldwide patents
from the leading engineering fields. He then ana-
lyzed solutions that were, in his judgment, most ef-
fective. This work provided the first understanding
of the trends, or patterns, of evolution for technical
systems. It also laid the foundation for the develop-
ment of an analytical approach to solving inventive
problems, later becoming the foundation for TRIZ,
his theory of inventing problem solving, with its axiom:
The evolution of all technical systems is
governed by objective laws.
These laws reveal that, during the evolution of a
technical system, improvement of any pa rt of that
system having already reached its pinnacle of func-
tional performance will lead to conflict with another
part. This conflict will lead to the eventual improve-
ment of the less evolved pa rt. This continuing, self-
sustaining process pushes the system ever closer to
its ideal state. Understanding this evolutionary pro-
cess allows us to forecast future trends in the devel-
opment of a technical system.
Over the past 40 years, TRIZ has developed into
a set of practical tools for inventing and solving tech-
nical problems of varying complexity. Today, we can
identify several basic TRIZ tools as well as other meth-
ods and techniques that combine to makeup what is
known as Systematic Innovation. Students and fol-
lowers of Altshuller developed these additional tech-
niques over the past 15 years.
This section p rovides a short int roduction to
some basic TRIZ tools. It is here for two reasons:
First, it is important for new readers to first learn
TRIZ terminology and its meaning so that they may
effectively utilize the 40 Principles to solve problems.
Second, it is important for the reader to be familiar
with the philosophy underlying TRIZ tools and tech-
niques in order to be able to fully apply them.
THE FOUNDATION OF TRIZ
1. Technical Systems:
Everything that performs a function is a techni-
cal system. Examples of technical systems include cars,
pens, books and knifes. Any technical system can con-
sist of one or more subsystems. A car is composed of
the subsystems engine, steering mechanism, brakes
and so on. Each of these is also a technical system
unto itself (with its own series of subsystems) — and
each performs its own function. The hierarchy of tech-
nical systems spans from the least complex, with only
two elements, to the most complex with many inter-
acting elements.
The table below shows the hierarchy of the tech-
nical system called “Transportation.” In the left col-
umn are names of technical systems. They are placed
in descending order. Horizontal rows contain names
of subsystems that belong to the technical system
described on the left.
For example, the technical system “Brake” is a
subsystem of the technical system “Car” — as well as
a supersystem for the technical system “Pad.”
When a technical system produces inadequate or
harmful functions it may need to be improved. This

requires the imaginative reduction of the system to
its simplest state. In TRIZ, the simplest technical sys-
tem consists of two elements with energy passing from
one element to the other.
Chalk and a blackboard are not, together, a tech-
nical system unless some energy  (mechanical force)
passes through the chalk causing it to interact with
the chalkboard. The technical system   “chalk, black-
board and applied force” can then become functional
— a chalkboa rd. Chalk and board, as separate ele-
ments, are each independent technical systems. Chalk
has a molecular st ructure. Interaction of di fferent
chemical elements within its st ructure p roduces a
bond creating a material called “chalk.” Should the
quality of the bond require improvement, then the
technical system of the molecular st ructure must be
analyzed. At the same time, chalk is a subsystems of
the supersystem chalkboard.
All subsystems are interconnected with each other
within the bounds of the higher system. Changes in
any one subsystem can produce changes in highe r,
supersystems. When solving a technical problem al-
ways consider interactions of the existing technical
system with those systems above and below it.
In addition, technical systems are like biological
systems. They are not immortal. They emerge, ripen
to maturity, and die — only to be replaced with new
systems.
2. Levels of Innovation
Analysis of a large number of patents reveals that
not eve ry invention is equal in its inventive value.
Altshuller proposed five levels of innovation:
Level #1. A simple improvement of a technical
system. Requires knowledge available within a trade
relevant to that system.
Level #2. An invention that includes the resolu-
tion of a technical contradiction. Requires knowl-
edge from different areas within an industry relevant
to the system.
Level #3. An invention containing a resolution
of a physical contradiction. Requires knowledge from
other industries.
Level #1 is not really innovative. It provides only
an improvement to an existing system without solv-
ing any technical problem. Levels #2 & #3 solve con-
tradictions, and therefore are innovative by definition.
Level #4. A new technology is developed con-
taining a breakthrough solution that requires knowl-
edge from different fields of science.
This fourth level also improves upon a technical
system, but without solving an existing technical
problem. Instead, it solves the problem by replacing
the original technology with a new technology.
Level #5. Discovery of new phenomena.
Here a new phenomenon is discovered that al-
lows pushing the existing technology to a higher level.
Altshuller concluded from his research that a large
number of patents (77%) belong only to Levels #1
and #2. The practical utilization of TRIZ methodol-
ogy can help inventors elevate their innovative solu-
tions to Levels #3 and #4.
3. Law of Ideality
The goal of any technical system is to provide
some function. Conventional engineering thought
states: “It is required to deliver such and such a func-
tion. Therefore, we must build such and such a mecha-
nism or device.”  TRIZ thinks: “It is required to de-
liver such and such a function without introducing a
new mechanism or device into the system.”
The Law of Ideality states that any technical sys-
tem, throughout its lifetime, tends to become more
reliable, simple, effective — more ideal. Eve ry time
we improve a technical system, we nudge that sys-
tem closer to Ideality. It costs less, requires less space,
wastes less energy, etc.
Ideality always reflects the maximum utilization
of existing resou rces, both inte rnal and external to
the system.  The more free or readily available the
resources utilized, the more ideal the system will be.
We can judge an inventive work by its degree of
Ideality. The further an invention is from its Ideal state,
the more complex the system will be —  and visa versa.
What happens when a system reaches Ideality?  The
mechanism disappears, while the function is performed.
Example: A meat plant in South America ships
its product to the United States. Refrigeration is
required during transport to keep the meat frozen.
The meat is flown to the United States, so refrig-
eration systems were installed in cargo planes. When
competition increased, the owner of the plant sought
to reduce delivery cost. It became obvious that he

==================================================


Page 3:
==================================================
must increase the amount of product per air ship-
ment. Analysis of the situation revealed that he
could compete better if  the weight of the refrig-
eration system were replaced with that of meat.
He did exactly that. Flying at an altitude of 15,000
- 25,000 feet the air temperature is below 32 o F,
so no refrigeration system was actually needed. Con-
clusion: Utilization of existing resources costing
nothing brought the system closer to Ideality.
 The art of inventing is the ability to remove bar-
riers to Ideality in order to qualitatively improve a
technical system. (In this book we are talking only
about technical systems. Of course, this statement
can be applied to any system.)
There are several ways to make a system more ideal:
A. Increase the amount of functions of the system.
Example: An entertainment center contains a ra-
dio, tape player, CD player, and amplifier.
B. Transfer as many functions as possible to that
working element which produces the system’s final
action.
Example: A crimping tool also cuts  wire, strips
insulation, and crimps the terminal to the wire.
C. Transfer some functions of the system to a
supersystem or to the outside environment.
Example: Usually, windows in a green house op-
erated manually. When the outside temperature is
low, the windows are closed. When it is hot, the
windows are opened for better ventilation. A new,
more ideal system can be developed when the win-
dows open and close automaticall y. This is ac-
complished with a temperature sensitive bimetal-
lic spiral mechanism.
D. Utilize internal and external resources that al-
ready exist and are available.
Example: Comtrad Industries, Inc. of Virginia re-
cently developed its Spectrum AntennaTM that uti-
lizes the existing wiring system of a house as an
additional receptor.
4. Contradictions
As mentioned before, the most effective solutions
are achieved when an inventor solves a technical prob-
lem that contains a contradiction. When and where
does a contradiction occur? It occurs when we are
trying to improve one characteristic, or paramete r,
of a technical system and cause another characteris-
tic, or parameter, of the system to deteriorate. A com-
promise solution is then usually considered.
A technical system has several characteristics (pa-
rameters) — weight, size, colo r, speed, rigidity, and
so on.  These characteristics describe the physical state
of a technical system. When solving technical prob-
lems, these characteristics help determine the tech-
nical contradictions residing in the problem.
Examples:
Increasing the power of an engine (positive improve-
ment) requires an increase in the size of the engine
(negative effect). So, an inventor considers increas-
ing the power partially in order to reduce the nega-
tive effect (compromise solution).
To increase the speed of an airplane, a new and more
powerful engine is installed. This inc reases the
weight of the airplane so the wings can no longer
support it during takeoff. Increasing the wing size
produces more drag, slowing the airplane down.
These are some examples of how improvements
can produce contradictions. The improvement goals
were never fully achieved because the root technical
contradictions were never resolved. These are called
technical contradictions because they happen inside
of technical systems. The 40 Principles are used to
resolve technical contradictions.
There is another type of contradiction — physi-
cal contradiction —  appearing when two opposite
properties are required from the same element of a
technical system or from the technical system itself.
There are different methods for resolving physical
contradictions (separation of contradicto ry require-
ments in time or space, changing the physical state
of a substance, etc.).
Examples:
Landing gear must be present on an airplane in or-
der to land and takeoff. It should not be present

==================================================
during flight because of an increase in air drag. The
physical contradiction is that the landing gear must
be both present and absent. This contradiction is
resolved by separating the requirements in time —
make the landing gear retractable.
For high water diving, water must be “ha rd” to
support the diver and “soft” so as not to injure the
diver. The physical contradiction: The water must
be hard and soft at the same time. This contradic-
tion is resolved by separating the requirements in
space: Saturate the water with air bubbles — the
pool contains both air and water.
5. Evolution of Technical Systems
Altshuller established eight Patterns, or Lines, of
technical systems evolution:
1. Life cycle.
2. Dynamization.
3. Multiplication cycle.
(Transition to Bi- or Poly- system)
4. Transition from macro to micro level.
5. Synchronization.
6. Scaling up or down
7. Uneven development of parts
8. Replacement of human (Automation)
Here are some of these patterns:
The Pattern of Dynamization suggests that any
technical system during its evolutionary process makes
a transition from a rigid to a flexible st ructure. This
transition can be summarized as follows: A solid sys-
tem obtains one joint, then many joints, then the
whole system becomes completely flexible. Dynam-
ization also means that a ridged system may be di-
vided into elements that can become moveable rela-
tive to each other.
Examples:
The steering column of a car has a joint allowing
adjustment of its vertical position.
An antenna becomes collapsible.
The landing gear of an airplane folds and retracts.
A good example of complete Dynamization is a
screwdriver whose stem is made of two springs, one
inside the other, with opposite winding directions
making it completely flexible.
The Pattern of Multiplication states that a tech-
nical system evolves first as a single system and then
later multiplies itself.
When similar elements are added togethe r, it is
called a homogeneous system. This combination of
elements acquires a whole new property.
Example: Two boats attached through a single
frame (a catamaran) become more stable than two
separate boats.
Different elements added together form a het-
erogeneous system. Such a system provide s mo re
functions while occupying less space.
Example: The pocketknife began its cycle with a
single blade. Different types of blades were added,
then scissors, screwdriver, a file and so on.
Another variation on the heterogeneous system
involves the addition of an opposite function pro-
ducing higher levels of innovation.
Examples:
A pencil and eraser are joined together.
A tape recorder can both record and erase.
The Pattern of Multiplication usually ends with
the rejection of all extra elements that belong to the
heterogeneous system  — driving the system back to
a mono system and thus beginning a new cycle.
The Pattern of Transition to Micro level states
that elements of a technical system during its life-
time have a tendency to decrease in size, eventually
collapsing into the micro level (molecules and atoms).
Examples:
1. A record playing device transitions f rom a
mechanical needle (having mechanical contact with
the surface grove of a record) into an optical system
with a laser reading information on a digital disk.
2. A computer mouse has a ball that converts me-
chanical hand movement into an electrical signal.
The next generation of mouse is a touch plate, where
the mechanical motion of a finger is transformed

A factory produces a new type of steel. Different
additives are added into the mix of molten steel. In
order to prevent the blade of the mixer from melt-
ing away during the mixing process, the blade must
have a protective coating. However, this coating may
pollute the mixture of molten steel.
2. Standards are the most e ffective method for
providing a graphical model of a problem. This
is called S-Field modeling.
S-Field modeling of a technical system is per-
formed in the Operating Zone, the area where the
core of the problem — the actual contradiction —
occurs. In this area, two substances (elements) and a
field (energy) must be present. Analysis of the S-Field
model helps determine changes necessary within the
technical system in order to improve it.
The diagram above shows a graphical model of
the molten steel mixer problem. S1 is the blade, S2 is
the molten steel, and F2 is the thermal energy of the
steel that melts blade S1. The wavy arrow represents
THE MAIN TOOLS OF TRIZ:
PRINCIPLES
The tools used to overcome technical contradic-
tions are called Principles.
Principles are generic suggestions for pe rform-
ing an action to, and within, a technical system. For
instance, Principle #1 (Segmentation) suggests find-
ing a way to separate one element of a technical sys-
tem into many small interconnected elements.
Example: How can we prevent a nail from mak-
ing a flat tire? The Segmentation principle indi-
cates we should separate all available internal space
of the tire into many sections —  hundreds , thou-
sand, millions....
The Periodic Action principle means that a con-
tinuous action should be replaced with a periodic, or
pulsating, action.
Example: Watering a lawn with a continuous stream
of water can damage the soil. A pulsating sprinkler
system eliminates this problem.
The 40 Principles described in this book allow
the development of numerous solution concepts for
every technical p roblem — without introducing a
compromise. Implementing a chosen concept still re-
mains the work of an engineer.
STANDARDS
Standards are st ructured rules for the synthesis
and reconstruction of technical systems. Once un-
derstood — and with some experience in their imple-
mentation — Standards can help combat many com-
plex problems.
Standards provide two functions:
1. Standards help to improve an existing system
or synthesize a new one.
Examples:
In order to improve a system, a certain substance
should be introduced; however, its introduction is
prohibited by conditions native to the problem.

a harmful interaction between the hot molten steel
(S2) and the blade (S1). To protect the blade, a third
substance, S3, must be introduced. In this case, S3 is
a modification of S2. By providing cold (F3) to blade
S1, a crust from the molten material will develop on
the blade’s surface and protect it from melting.
Altshuller offered 72 Standards divided into five
classes:
Class #1: Build or destroy an S-Field.
Class #2: Develop an S-Field.
Class #3: Transition from the base system to a
supersystem or to the micro-level.
Class #4: Measure or detect anything within a
technical system.
Class #5: Describes how to introduce sub
stances or fields into the technical
system.
ARIZ
(Algorithm to Solve an Inventive Problem)
ARIZ is the central analytical tool of TRIZ.  It
provides specific sequential steps for developing a
solution for complex problems.
The first version of ARIZ was developed in 1968
and many modifications during the next 20 years re-
ceived. Over the years, it has become a precise tool
for solving a wide variety of technical problems.
The most recent version, ARIZ- 85C, was pub-
lished in 1985 and contains nine steps. Each step
includes many sub-steps. Below is brief description
of the nine steps.
Step #1. Analysis of the problem.
Begin by making the transition from vaguely de-
fined statements of the problem to a simply stated
(without jargon or terminology specific to any in-
dustry) mini-problem.
Example: “A technical system consisting of elements
A, B, and C has technical contradiction TC (state
the contradiction). It is necessary to provide required
function F  (state the function) while incurring  mini-
mal changes to the system.”
It is not important that such a result is achiev-
able; however, it is important to state that the system
should stay the same — or become even simple r.
Step #1 also provides for an analysis of conflict-
ing situations; i.e., technical contradictions. Here a
decision has to be made as to which contradiction
should be considered for further resolution. Once
decided, a model of the problem is formulated.
Step #2. Analysis of the problem’s model.
A simplified diagram modeling the conflict in the
Operating Zone is drawn. (The Operating Zone is a
specified narrow area of the conflict). Then an as-
sessment of all available resources is made.
Step #3. Formulation of the Ideal Final Re-
sult (IFR).
Usually, the statement of the IFR reveals contra-
dictory requirements to the critical component of the
system in the Operating Zone. This is the Physical
Contradiction.
As a result of these first three steps, a vague prob-
lem is transformed into a specific physical problem —
the Physical Contradiction.
In many cases the problem is solved by the end of
Step #3. If so, you can p roceed to steps 7, 8 and 9.
There are several additional steps in ARIZ that provide
more recommendations for resolving a contradiction.
Step #4. Utilization of outside substances and
field resources.
If the problem remains unclear, the “Small Min-
iature Man” model f rom Step #4 is imaginatively
applied in order to better understand the problem.
Step #5. Utilization of informational data
bank.
Consider solving the problem by applying Standards
in conjunction with a database of physical effects.
Step 6. Change or reformulate the problem.
If the problem has still not been solved, ARIZ rec-
ommends returning to the starting point and reformu-
lating the problem in respect to the supersystem. This
looping process can be done several times.
The following steps apply once a solution has been
found:
Step 7. Analysis of the method that removed
the Physical Contradiction.
The main goal of this step is to check out the

==================================================
quality of a solution: Has the Physical Contradiction
been removed most ideally?
Step 8. Utilization of found solution.
This step guides you through an analysis of effects the
new system may have on adjacent systems. It also forces the
search for applications to other technical problems.
Step 9.  Analysis of steps that lead to the
solution.
This is a check point where the real process used to
solve a problem is compared with that suggested by
ARIZ. Deviations are analyzed for possible future use.
Mastering the powerful TRIZ tools requires many
hours of stud y, along with working many practice
problems. We hope that other books in this series
will help you accomplish this task.
