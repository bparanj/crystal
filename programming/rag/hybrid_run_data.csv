 '2023 Environmental Report  Advancing carbon-free energy\nOur primary approach for reducing our Scope 2 emissions \nis through the procurement of carbon-free energy.\u200983 Since \n2017, we’ve matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an annual basis.\n\u200984 \nHowever, because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind across the regions where we operate—and because of the variable supply of these resources—we still need to rely on carbon-emitting energy sources that power local grids (see Figure 15). That’s why, in 2020, we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where we operate by 2030, aiming to procure clean energy to meet our electricity needs, every hour of every day, within every grid where we operate. Achieving this will also increase the impact of our clean energy procurement on the decarbonization of the grids that serve us.'
 '2030 (24/7 CFE). We’ve been working hard to transition our operations and the electricity grids that serve us to cleaner sources of power, through a combination of clean energy procurement, technology innovation, and policy advocacy. And we expect our work to decarbonize electricity grids where we operate to contribute to decarbonization across our value chain as well.\nCharting our path\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals—what we call “moonshots.” We also know that our path to net-zero emissions won’t be easy or linear; it may require us to navigate significant uncertainty and deploy new systems and technologies across our business. Some of our plans will take years to deliver their full results, particularly where they involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we expect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.'

 '24/7 CFE progress\nWe believe in transparency as a guiding principle, so this year, we’re expanding our carbon-free energy reporting.
