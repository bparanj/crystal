I've ordered these based on:

1. Starting with foundational knowledge (machine learning basics and linear algebra)
2. Moving to general programming with AI
3. Progressing to specific frameworks like LangChain
4. Advanced into specialized areas like generative AI and time series
5. Culminating in complex topics like building LLMs and deep reinforcement learning
