What is the difference between `jupyter notebook` and `jupyter lab`?

`jupyter notebook` is the older, more traditional interface for working with notebooks. It provides a simple web-based environment where you write and execute Python code in cells, and the results appear inline.

`jupyter lab` is a newer, more flexible interface. It offers a tabbed, IDE-like experience. In JupyterLab, you can open multiple notebooks, terminals, text files, and other components side by side. It is designed as a modular and extensible environment, allowing you to integrate a variety of tools and workflows in one place. Essentially, JupyterLab is the next generation environment for working with notebooks, code, and data in a more feature-rich and customizable workspace.

### Fixing Installation

This error often appears when there’s a version conflict with Python packages, particularly `attrs` and `attr` libraries. JupyterLab (and the libraries it depends on, such as `jupyter_events` or `jsonschema`) expects the newer `attrs` package, which uses `attrs.NOTHING`. If an older version of `attrs` is installed, or if the `attr` library is conflicting, the import will fail.

**Steps to fix:**

1. **Update `attrs`:**  
   Try upgrading the `attrs` package to the latest version:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade attrs
   ```

2. **Check for `attr` vs `attrs`:**  
   Ensure you don’t have an `attr` package installed separately that conflicts with `attrs`. You can check what you have installed:
   ```bash
   pip list | grep attr
   ```
   If you see something named `attr` (not `attrs`), try removing it:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall attr
   ```

3. **Upgrade `jsonschema` and `jupyterlab`:**  
   In some cases, older versions of `jsonschema` or `jupyterlab` can cause this issue. Try:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade jsonschema jupyterlab
   ```

After updating, try running:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

If successful, JupyterLab should now start without the import error.
