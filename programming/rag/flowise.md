Below is an example **Packer** template in **HCL2 format** (recommended for Packer 1.7+) that will create an **Amazon Linux 2** AMI with **Flowise** installed and configured to run via **PM2** at boot. Once built, you can use the resulting AMI in your **Terraform** configuration to spin up an EC2 instance that is ready to serve Flowise on port 3000.

> **Notes**  
> 1. This example uses **Amazon Linux 2**. You can switch to a different base AMI if you prefer Ubuntu or another OS.  
> 2. By default, Flowise listens on port **3000**. To make Flowise accessible, ensure this port is opened in your AWS Security Group.  
> 3. This template includes a basic **systemd** unit for **PM2** so that Flowise starts on reboot.  
> 4. Adjust IAM instance profile, region, subnet_id, vpc_id, etc., in the builders section per your environment requirements.  
> 5. Make sure that your AWS credentials are properly configured in your environment variables or credentials file so Packer can authenticate.

## How to Use this Packer Template

1. **Install Packer** if you havenâ€™t already.  
2. Save the above HCL template to a file, e.g., `flowise.pkr.hcl`.  
3. (Optional) Adjust any variables (like `aws_region`, `flowise_repo`, etc.) in the file or via the command line.  
4. Run `packer init flowise.pkr.hcl` to initialize the required plugins.  
5. Run `packer validate flowise.pkr.hcl` to ensure there are no syntax or configuration issues.  
6. Run `packer build flowise.pkr.hcl` to build the AMI.  

Packer will output something similar to:

```
...
amazon-ebs.flowise: AMI: ami-0123456789abcdef
Build 'build-flowise-ami' finished.
...
```

Take note of the **AMI** ID (e.g., `ami-0123456789abcdef`).

## Using This AMI in Terraform

Below is a simplified example Terraform snippet that uses the AMI built by Packer. It assumes:

- You have the same region defined in your Terraform.
- You open port **3000** on a security group so that Flowise is accessible.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

variable "flowise_ami_id" {
  type    = string
  default = "ami-0123456789abcdef"  # Replace with the AMI ID from Packer
}

resource "aws_security_group" "flowise_sg" {
  name        = "flowise-sg"
  description = "Allow port 3000 inbound"
  vpc_id      = "vpc-12345678"  # replace with your VPC ID

  ingress {
    description      = "Flowise inbound"
    from_port        = 3000
    to_port          = 3000
    protocol         = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port        = 0
    to_port          = 0
    protocol         = "-1"
    cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "flowise_ec2" {
  ami                         = var.flowise_ami_id
  instance_type               = "t3.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids      = [aws_security_group.flowise_sg.id]
  subnet_id                   = "subnet-abc12345"  # replace with your subnet

  tags = {
    Name = "Flowise-EC2-Instance"
  }
}
```

1. Replace **`ami-0123456789abcdef`** with the AMI ID that Packer created.  
2. Replace **`vpc-12345678`** and **`subnet-abc12345`** with your actual VPC and subnet IDs.  
3. Apply this Terraform configuration, and Terraform will launch an EC2 instance from the Flowise AMI.

---

You now have a **Packer** template that creates a ready-to-go **Flowise** AMI on AWS, along with a sample **Terraform** snippet to deploy that AMI. Adjust and customize as needed for your environment (e.g., more robust IAM roles, different instance sizes, public/private subnets, etc.).
