 '2030 (24/7 CFE). We’ve been working hard to transition our operations and the electricity grids that serve us to cleaner sources of power, through a combination of clean energy procurement, technology innovation, and policy advocacy. And we expect our work to decarbonize electricity grids where we operate to contribute to decarbonization across our value chain as well.\nCharting our path\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals—what we call “moonshots.” We also know that our path to net-zero emissions won’t be easy or linear; it may require us to navigate significant uncertainty and deploy new systems and technologies across our business. Some of our plans will take years to deliver their full results, particularly where they involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we expect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.'
