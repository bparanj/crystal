      "=== Origin ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The oldest known literary mention of a \"Golden Age\" of piracy is from 1894, when the English journalist George Powell wrote about \"What appears to have been the golden age of piracy up to the last decade of the 17th century.\"  Powell uses the phrase while reviewing Charles Leslie's A New and Exact History of Jamaica, then over 150 years old. Powell uses the phrase only once.\n",
      "In 1897, a more systematic use of the phrase \"Golden Age of Piracy\" was introduced by historian John Fiske, who wrote, \"At no other time in the world's history has the business of piracy thriven so greatly as in the seventeenth century and the first part of the eighteenth. Its golden age may be said to have extended from about 1650 to about 1720.\"  Fiske included the activities of the Barbary corsairs and East Asian pirates in this \"Golden Age,\" noting that \"as these Mussulman pirates and those of Eastern Asia were as busily at work in the seventeenth century as at any other time, their case does not impair my statement that the age of the buccaneers was the Golden Age of piracy.\"\n",
      "Pirate historians of the first half of the 20th century occasionally adopted Fiske's term \"Golden Age,\" without necessarily following his beginning and ending dates for it.  The most expansive definition of an age of piracy was that of Patrick Pringle, who wrote in 1951 that \"the most flourishing era in the history of piracy ... began in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and ended in the second decade of the eighteenth century.\"  This idea starkly contradicted Fiske, who had hotly denied that such Elizabethan figures as Drake were pirates.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Trend toward narrow definitions ===\n",
      "Of recent definitions, that given by Pringle appears to have the widest range, an exception to an overall trend among historians from 1909 until the 1990s, toward narrowing the Golden Age.  As early as 1924, Philip Gosse described piracy as being at its height \"from 1680 until 1730.\" In his highly popular 1978 book The Pirates for TimeLife's The Seafarers series, Douglas Botting defined the Golden Age as lasting \"barely 30 years, starting at the close of the 17th Century and ending in the first quarter of the 18th.\"  Botting's definition was closely followed by Frank Sher\n",

      "Google's environmental initiatives focus on three key pillars: empowering individuals, working together with partners and customers, and operating sustainably. Some specific initiatives include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Empowering Individuals**: Google aims to help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices through features like eco-friendly routing in Google Maps, energy efficiency features in Google Nest, and carbon emissions information in Google Flights.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Working Together**: Google collaborates with various organizations and initiatives, such as the iMasons Climate Accord for carbon reduction in digital infrastructure and the Nature Conservancy for projects focused on reforestation and monitoring deforestation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Operating Sustainably**: Google has committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions and has implemented sustainability practices in its operations, such as using renewable energy and enhancing the efficiency of its data centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Water Stewardship and Circular Economy**: Google promotes water stewardship, exemplified by its Bay View campus, which is designed to be net water-positive, and it is pursuing a circular economy approach by engaging with suppliers to reduce waste and emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Investment in Technology for Sustainability**: Google invests in technologies that address sustainability challenges, such as machine learning to prevent emissions and data analytics tools to optimize operations for airlines and renewable energy suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Public Policy Advocacy**: Google actively engages in public policy discussions to support the promotion of sustainable practices and repair and reuse of goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through these initiatives, Google aims to significantly reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable practices across its operations and supply chain.\n",
