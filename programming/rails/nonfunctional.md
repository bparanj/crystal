### Nonfunctional Issues

- Does the code fit with your organization's development standards and style guides? 
- Is there an opportunity to refactor? 
- Can a part be coded more readably or more efficiently? 
- Can some elements reuse an existing library or component?

Examine the file and directory structure, the build and configuration process, the user interface and the system's documentation.
