## Code as Exemplar

Sometimes, when trying to understand how a particular feature in software works, you can find explanations in textbooks or articles. But often, the best way to learn “how it's done” is by reading the  code. This approach is not only useful for understanding the functionality but also essential for developing software that needs to be compatible with that existing code.

Be flexible. Use a number of different strategies to understand how the code works. Start with any documentation. Use the system to get a feel for its external interfaces. Understand what you are looking for:

- A system call
- An algorithm
- Code sequence
- An architecture

Devise a strategy that will uncover the target.

- Trace through the instruction execution sequence. Run the program and place a breakpoint in a strategic location.
- Textually search through the code to find specific code or data elements.
- Use tools to locate the code.

Once you locate the desired code, study it, ignoring irrelevant elements.

If you find it difficult to understand the code in its original context, copy it into a temporary file and remove all irrelevant parts. The formal name of this procedure is slicing.
