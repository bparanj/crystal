## Code Reading Order

When learning a large codebase like Rails, reading the code from top to bottom isn't  the most effective or efficient method. Large codebases can be complex and overwhelming, making it hard to grasp the overall architecture and specific functionalities by linear reading. Here’s a more strategic approach to understand a specific aspect of the codebase:

1. **Start with Documentation**:
   - Begin by reading the official documentation, READMEs, and any architectural overviews available. This gives you a high-level understanding of the codebase structure, design patterns, and key components.

2. **Identify Key Entry Points**:
   - Determine the entry points for the feature or aspect you’re interested in. In Rails, this could be specific controllers, models, or configuration files.

3. **Trace Functionality**:
   - Follow the flow of execution starting from the entry point. Trace how a request is processed, or how data flows through the system. Use debugging tools or insert `puts`/`logger` statements to see the execution flow in action.

4. **Focus on Integration Points**:
   - Pay attention to how different parts of the application interact with each other. In Rails, look at how models, views, controllers, and services are interconnected.

5. **Use the Rails Console for Experimentation**:
   - Rails Console can be an invaluable tool for experimenting with live objects, querying the database, and understanding the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer.

6. **Study Tests**:
   - Rails projects often have comprehensive test suites. Reading tests can provide insights into the expected behavior of the code and how different parts are supposed to interact.

7. **Dive into Specific Modules**:
   - Once you have a general understanding, dive deeper into specific modules or classes relevant to your area of interest. Focus on understanding the local scope before expanding to the broader context.

8. **Utilize IDE Features**:
   - Use features of your IDE (like code navigation, find usages, etc.) to easily navigate through the code and understand relationships between different parts.

9. **Look at Change History**:
   - Browse the version control history (like Git logs) to understand why certain changes were made. This can provide context that is not immediately apparent from the current state of the code.

10. **Engage with the Community**:
    - If you’re stuck, consider reaching out to the community through forums, mailing lists, or even by reviewing open/closed issues and pull requests on the project’s repository.

Understanding a large codebase is a gradual process. Start with specific features or components and expand your understanding over time. It’s about connecting the dots and seeing the big picture.
