## Needed Git Skills

- Squashing and rebasing commits
- Keep your fork updated (fetching upstream)
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Git Bisect : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7zoD6NZy6vY&t=3596s

## Running Tests

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake test
```

ActionPack Module

```
cd actionpack
bundle exec rake test
```

Run tests for specific Ruby test file:

```
cd actionpack
bundle exec ruby -I test/test/abastract/translation_test.rb
```

Run tests for a specific database adapter:

```
cd activerecord
bundle exec rake test:mysql2
```

Running one specific test file for MySQL adapter:

```
bundle exec rake test:mysql2 TEST=test/cases/connection_adapters/connection_handler_test.rb
```

Running a single test case from a test file using the MySQL adapter:

bundle exec rake test:mysql2 TEST=test/cases/database_configurations_test.rb TESTOPTS="'-n /test_name_goes_here"

You can test only the functionality you are working on currently.
