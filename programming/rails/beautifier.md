## Code Beautifier

Use a beautifier to:

- Fix code that is written inconsistently without following any formatting standards
- Adopt orphaned code for maintenance
- Create a temporary version of the code to help you decipher it
- Integrate code under the common roof of a larger project

A beautifier, also known as a code formatter, is a tool that automatically adjusts the formatting of your code to make it more consistent and readable. Here's how a beautifier can be useful in different scenarios:

1. **Fixing Inconsistently Formatted Code**:
   - When code is written without following any specific formatting standards, it can be hard to read and understand. A beautifier can automatically reformat this code to follow a consistent style, like aligning indentation, adding spaces where needed, and organizing lines for better readability.

2. **Adopting Orphaned Code for Maintenance**:
   - Orphaned code is code that was written by someone else (often who is no longer part of the team) and might not follow the current team's coding standards. A beautifier can reformat this code to match the team's current style guidelines, making it easier for the new maintainers to understand and work with it.

3. **Creating a Temporary Version of the Code for Deciphering**:
   - Sometimes, to understand complex or poorly written code, it can be helpful to look at a differently formatted version of the same code. A beautifier can rearrange the code temporarily to make the structure clearer, which can aid in deciphering how the code works.

4. **Integrating Code into a Larger Project**:
   - When adding new code to a larger existing project, it's important for all the code to follow the same style guidelines for consistency. A beautifier can automatically format the new code to match the style of the existing project, ensuring a uniform appearance and making it easier to merge and maintain.

Think of a beautifier as a tool that cleans up and neatens your code. This makes the code more readable for everyone.

### Exercise 1

Can VS code IDE source browser cooperate with other tools? For example, can you search or otherwise process the results listed by the browser, or have the browser automatically create a report of where each function contained in a list you supply is defined? Propose a source browser design that provides this flexibility.

VS Code has a powerful API that allows it to interact with other tools and extensions. This API can be used to create a more flexible source browser. Here's a high-level design:

1. **Search and Process Results**: VS Code's API allows extensions to perform workspace-wide searches. An extension could use this to search for all instances of a function or variable name. The results could then be processed in various ways, such as by filtering them based on certain criteria, or by grouping them by file or location in the code.

```javascript
vscode.workspace.findFiles('**/*.js', '**/node_modules/**').then(files => {
  // Process the files...
});
```

2. **Report Generation**: The extension could also generate reports based on these search results. For example, it could create a markdown file that lists all the places where each function is defined, with links to the relevant locations in the code.

```javascript
const report = results.map(result => `- [${result.name}](${result.file}:${result.line})`).join('\n');
fs.writeFileSync('report.md', report);
```

3. **Integration with Other Tools**: VS Code's API also allows extensions to run shell commands, which means they can interact with other command-line tools. For example, an extension could use a tool like ctags to generate a tag file for a codebase, and then use that to provide more accurate or detailed search results.

```javascript
const exec = require('child_process').exec;
exec('ctags -R .', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  // Process the output...
});
```

4. **User Interface**: The extension could provide a user interface for performing searches and generating reports. This could be a sidebar that allows the user to enter a search query, select the types of files to include in the search, and choose the format for the report.

```javascript
vscode.window.createTreeView('myExtension.view', { treeDataProvider: aProvider });
```

This design provides a lot of flexibility, but it would also require a significant amount of work to implement. It would also need to be updated regularly to keep up with changes to VS Code's API and to the JavaScript language itself.
