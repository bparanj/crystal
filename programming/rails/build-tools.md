## Build Tools

What build tools are used for Rails framework codebase?

The Ruby on Rails framework utilizes several build tools and systems for its development and maintenance. These tools are essential for various tasks like dependency management, testing, and automation. Key build tools used in the Rails framework codebase include:

1. **Bundler**:
   - Manages Ruby gem dependencies.
   - Ensures consistent gem versions across different development and production environments.

2. **Rake**:
   - A Ruby-based build program.
   - Used for creating, running, and managing tasks, such as database migrations, tests, and custom build scripts.

3. **Yarn**:
   - For managing JavaScript dependencies.
   - Used in conjunction with the Webpacker gem for handling JavaScript in Rails applications.

4. **Webpacker** (for Rails 6 and later):
   - Integrates Webpack, a JavaScript module bundler, into Rails.
   - Manages JavaScript, CSS, and assets compilation.

5. **RSpec** or **MiniTest** (for testing):
   - Rails uses MiniTest by default, but some developers and projects prefer RSpec.
   - These are testing tools for writing and running automated tests (unit, functional, and integration tests).

6. **CI/CD Tools (like GitHub Actions, Travis CI)**:
   - For continuous integration and deployment.
   - Automatically run tests and other checks on pull requests and commits.

7. **RuboCop** (for linting):
   - A static code analyzer and formatter to ensure code adheres to Ruby and Rails style guides.

8. **Git**:
   - For version control and source code management.
   - Used for tracking changes, branching, and collaboration among contributors.

9. **RubyGems**:
   - The package manager for Ruby, used to distribute Rails itself as a gem.

10. **Documentation Tools (like RDoc or YARD)**:
    - For generating API documentation from the Ruby codebase.

These tools collectively support the development lifecycle of the Rails framework, ensuring that the codebase remains robust, well-tested, and maintainable. Contributors to Rails  need to be familiar with these tools to effectively work on the framework.
