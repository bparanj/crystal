## Labeling Code Sections

Examine the syntactic details of the code and label the purpose of the variables and sections of code. You can create a readable representation of code by labelling sections of the code as you read it. Ask yourself:

- What is the intent of the variables? Variable declaration vs what it represents. Example: Location map.
- What does the variable represent? Example: xLocation vs Store x map offset
- What is the purpose of a section of code? Example: Block of code that determines x offset
