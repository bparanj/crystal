## Build Documentation

The Rails documentation is built using a combination of automated tools and manual processes to ensure that it is comprehensive, up-to-date, and accessible. Here's how the documentation process  works:

1. **Source Code Comments**: 
   - Much of the Rails documentation is written as comments directly in the source code. These comments use the RDoc formatting, a Ruby documentation tool.
   - Developers write documentation comments above classes, modules, methods, and other code elements.

2. **RDoc Tool**:
   - Rails uses RDoc to generate documentation from these source code comments.
   - RDoc processes the comments and generates HTML files representing the documentation.
   - This includes class and module descriptions, method details, and other relevant information.

3. **Automated Generation**:
   - The documentation generation process can be automated as part of the build or release process. 
   - This ensures that any changes in the codebase are reflected in the documentation.

4. **API Documentation**:
   - The Rails API documentation (http://api.rubyonrails.org) is generated from the source code and is hosted online.
   - It provides detailed reference material for Rails developers.

5. **Guides and Tutorials**:
   - Apart from API documentation, Rails also includes various guides and tutorials.
   - These are maintained as separate files, often written in Markdown or other easy-to-write formats.
   - They are also part of the Rails repository, allowing contributors to update or add new guides as needed.

6. **Versioning**:
   - Documentation is versioned alongside the code. Each version of Rails has its corresponding documentation, ensuring that users can access the correct documentation for the version they are using.

7. **Community Contributions**:
   - The Rails community actively contributes to the documentation.
   - Developers can submit pull requests to improve or update the documentation, just as they would with code.

8. **Hosting and Accessibility**:
   - The generated documentation is hosted on dedicated websites (like Ruby on Rails API, Rails Guides) and is accessible to the public.

This process ensures that the Rails documentation is a living document, evolving alongside the framework and providing valuable resources to the Rails community.
