## Documentation

Spending a significant amount of time examining and understanding the source code of a program can sometimes only yield a small amount of useful information compared to what could be quickly learned from consulting the documentation.

A well written documentation can quickly answer questions that might take much longer to figure out by reading the code. 

A common tendency among developers is to dive directly into the code rather than consulting the documentation first. This can lead to spending unnecessary time deciphering code when a quicker answer might be found in the documentation.

Use documentation as a first resource for understanding how parts of a software system work, rather than trying to infer everything directly from the code. It serves as a reminder that while reading and understanding code is a valuable skill, leveraging available documentation can often save time and effort.

## System Specification Document

The system specification document details the objectives of the system, its functional requirements, management and technical constraints, and cost and schedule parameters. Use the system specification document to understand the environment where the code you are reading will operate.

Rails framework does not have a single, unified system specification document in the traditional sense. Instead, Rails relies on a combination of documentation types to convey its specifications:

1. **API Documentation**: The Rails API documentation provides detailed information about the classes, modules, methods, and functionalities available in Rails. It serves as a reference for developers to understand the specifics of various Rails components.

2. **Rails Guides**: These are more narrative and tutorial-like, offering explanations and usage guides for different parts of the Rails framework. They cover topics ranging from getting started with Rails to understanding its conventions and advanced features.

3. **Code Comments**: The Rails codebase itself is heavily commented. These comments provide insights into the code's intent and functionality, acting as an in-line specification for smaller components.

4. **Changelogs and Release Notes**: Each Rails release comes with changelogs and release notes that document the changes, additions, and fixes in the new version. These documents are valuable for understanding the evolution of the framework.

5. **Contributing Guides**: For those looking to contribute to Rails, there are guides that explain the contribution process, coding standards, and other practices. While not a system specification, they provide insights into the framework's design and development philosophy.

6. **GitHub Repository**: The Rails GitHub repository itself,  issues and pull requests, can be seen as a living document offering insights into the ongoing development and discussions surrounding Rails features and specifications.

The framework's specifications are comprehensively covered through its API documentation, guides and code comments.

## Software Requirements Specification

Rails framework does not have a traditional Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document like you might find in some software engineering projects. Rails, being an open-source project and a web application framework, follows a different approach:

1. **GitHub Repository**: The primary source of requirements and features for Rails is its GitHub repository. Proposed changes, enhancements, and bug reports are discussed in issues and pull requests.

2. **Rails Guides**: These provide extensive information on how to use various features of Rails. While not a requirements document per se, they offer practical guidance on what Rails can do and how to do it.

3. **API Documentation**: The Rails API documentation details the capabilities and expected behaviors of different Rails components, effectively serving as a de facto specification.

4. **Changelogs and Release Notes**: Each Rails release comes with detailed notes that include new features, changes, deprecations, and fixes, which collectively indicate the evolving requirements and capabilities of the framework.

5. **Community Discussions and RFCs**: Rails, being community-driven, often sees requirements and new features emerging from discussions on forums, chat channels, or through Request for Comments (RFCs) processes.

6. **Contributing Guide**: The Rails contributing guide, while not a requirements document, provides insights into development priorities and what types of contributions are welcome.

In the context of open-source projects like Rails, requirements are often dynamic and community-driven, as opposed to the fixed and formally defined requirements you would expect in a traditional SRS document. The combination of documentation, community input and ongoing development discussions collectively define what Rails should do and how it should behave.
