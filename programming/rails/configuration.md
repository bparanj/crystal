## Configuration

Following the principle of dependency isolation, the configuration elements are  isolated in a few files.

## Exercises

Read the source code of a configuration script, explaining how two different configuration options are determined.

How is Rake used to configure Rails before release?

Rake, a Ruby build tool, is used extensively in the Rails framework for various tasks,  configuring and preparing Rails for release. Here’s how Rake contributes to the process:

1. **Running Tests**: 
   - One of the most crucial steps before any release is to ensure that all tests pass. Rake is used to run the entire test suite of Rails, which includes unit tests, integration tests, and others. 
   - The command `rake test` is  used for this purpose.

2. **Database Migrations and Schema Management**:
   - Rake tasks handle database-related setup, which includes creating, updating, and resetting databases. This ensures that the database schema is in the correct state before the release.

3. **Compiling Assets**:
   - For Rails applications that use the asset pipeline, Rake tasks are involved in precompiling assets. While this is more relevant to application deployment, it’s also crucial for testing Rails with assets in a production-like environment.

4. **Generating Documentation**:
   - Rake tasks are used to generate API documentation from the source code. The RDoc tool is often integrated with Rake to automate this process.
   - The command might be something like `rake rdoc` to generate the documentation.

5. **Building Gems**:
   - Rake tasks can be configured to build the Rails gem before a release. This involves packaging the framework's code into a gem file, which can be distributed via RubyGems.
   - The command could be `rake build`, which creates a gem file in the `pkg` directory.

6. **Release Tasks**:
   - Rake can be used for various release-related tasks, such as tagging a specific version in Git or pushing the built gem to RubyGems.
   - These tasks are often automated or semi-automated through Rake scripts.

7. **Custom Release Checks**:
   - Custom Rake tasks might be created to perform additional checks or preparations specific to the Rails release process.

8. **Cleanup and Maintenance**:
   - Rake tasks may also be used for any necessary cleanup or maintenance tasks to ensure the codebase is tidy and well-organized before the release.

Rake's flexibility and integration with Ruby make it an ideal tool for these tasks, contributing to a smooth and efficient release process for the Rails framework.
