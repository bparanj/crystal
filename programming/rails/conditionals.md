## Exercises

Discover how the editor can identify matching braces and parentheses.

Examine all control structures that do not use braces and mark the statements that will get executed.

This instruction means to carefully review the sections of code where control structures (like `if`, `for`, `while` statements) are used without curly braces `{}`. You should identify and highlight which specific lines or commands will be executed as part of these control structures. This is important because in many programming languages, if braces are not used, only the immediately following statement is considered part of the control structure. Identifying these statements ensures clarity in understanding the code's flow and logic.

Verify that the indentation of a function matches the control flow.

The mandatory use of braces in Perl's control structures contributes to consistent and clear code formatting. This requirement ensures that the scope of each control structure is visually distinct and easy to identify, reducing ambiguity about which statements are controlled by structures like `if`, `while`, or `for`. This can enhance readability, making it easier for programmers to understand and maintain the code, especially in complex or nested structures. Consistency in code structure is often valued for its contribution to overall code clarity and maintainability.
