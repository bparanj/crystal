## Small Refactoring

This refers to making small, incremental changes to improve the structure and readability of the code without altering its external behavior. This approach focuses on minor adjustments, such as renaming variables for clarity, simplifying complex expressions, or reorganizing code blocks for better logical flow. These small-scale refinements collectively contribute to cleaner, more maintainable, and efficient code. It's a continuous process that enhances code quality without introducing new functionality or significant alterations.

- How to reorganize code sections to make them more readable

Start with small changes. There are more than 70 types of refactoring changes.

- How many types of refactoring changes have been accepted to Rails ?

There isn't a specific count or categorized list detailing the types of refactoring changes accepted in the Rails codebase. However, in general, refactoring in Rails, like in many large open-source projects,  includes:

1. **Improving Code Readability**: Simplifying complex code for better understanding.
2. **Optimizing Performance**: Enhancing the efficiency of certain operations.
3. **Removing Redundancies**: Eliminating unnecessary code duplications.
4. **Updating Deprecated Syntax**: Replacing outdated methods or practices with current ones.
5. **Enhancing Security**: Making changes to secure the code against vulnerabilities.
6. **Improving Code Structure**: Modifying the architecture of the code to make it more maintainable.

For the most specific and detailed information about refactoring in Rails, you can refer to the Rails GitHub repository and its contribution guidelines, as well as discussions and pull requests related to refactoring.

- What about using the Github API to analyze and check the approved PRs to categorize accepted refactoring types?

Using the GitHub API to analyze and categorize the types of refactoring changes accepted in the Rails codebase is a feasible and effective approach. Here's a general outline of how you might do this:

1. **Access the Rails Repository**: Use the GitHub API to access the Rails repository.

2. **Fetch Pull Requests (PRs)**: Retrieve data on merged pull requests. You can filter PRs by labels or keywords in the title or description that indicate refactoring, like "refactor", "clean up", or "improve code".

3. **Analyze PR Content**: Examine the changes in each PR to understand the nature of the refactoring. This could involve looking at the code differences, reading PR descriptions, and reviewing discussion threads.

4. **Categorize Refactoring Types**: Based on your analysis, categorize each PR into types of refactoring changes. Common categories might include code simplification, performance optimization, code structure improvement, etc.

5. **Aggregate Data**: Compile and aggregate your findings to get an overview of the types and frequency of refactoring changes in the Rails codebase.

This process would require programming skills to interact with the GitHub API, analyze text and code, and possibly some machine learning techniques for more sophisticated categorization. It's a data-driven way to get insights into the development practices and priorities within the Rails community.

Modest changes add up and often expose larger possible improvements.

- Learn to read the expressions

Example: Read expressions using the conditional operator like if code.

- How can you rewrite the expression to make the intent clear?
- How can you visually emphasize the semantic content instead of the punctuation or other sytax?
- How can you make code more readable, self-documenting and easier to verify?
- Is the code compact and unreadable but not efficient?

Sometimes efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing code readability.

Often you can make an expression more readable by adding whitespace, by breaking it up into smaller parts by means of temporary variables, or by using parentheses to amplify the precedence of certain operators.

Names and indentation can provide hints for understanding code functionality. Choose good names and indent programs consistently.

- How to provide visual clues that are beyond the abilities of automated formatting tools.
- Separate formatting changes from logic. Check in separately to make change history clear.

## Exercises

Look for opportunities to improve the code structure to make it more readable.

How does gradual code changes help us untangle the code?

Gradual code changes help untangle complex or convoluted code by allowing for a systematic and controlled approach to refactoring. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Easier to Understand**: Small, incremental changes make it easier to understand the existing code structure and logic. It's less overwhelming than trying to understand and modify a large, complicated codebase all at once.

2. **Reduces Risk**: Making gradual changes reduces the risk of introducing bugs or breaking the existing functionality. It's easier to spot and fix errors when changes are small and isolated.

3. **Focus on Specific Areas**: Gradual changes allow developers to focus on one aspect of the code at a time, be it improving function names, simplifying a complex method, or restructuring a small section of code. 

4. **Testing and Validation**: With each small change, it's easier to test and validate that the modification hasn't adversely affected the application. This helps maintain the stability of the codebase.

5. **Learning Opportunity**: Gradual changes provide an opportunity to learn more about the codebase. Each change can reveal insights about the design and functionality, which can inform future refactoring decisions.

6. **Building a Cleaner Codebase**: Over time, these small changes accumulate, leading to a significantly cleaner, more maintainable, and well-structured codebase. 

The gradual code changes provide a safer and more manageable path to untangle and improve complex code.

- What is the coding standard used in the project? 

Verify code follows the coding standard.
