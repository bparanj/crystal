Integrating Supabase Authentication with Ruby on Rails: Securely Matching JWT Tokens to Users

To ensure your Ruby on Rails API recognizes which user a valid token belongs to, you'll need to extract and verify the user's information embedded within the token. Supabase uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, and these tokens  contain identifiable user information, such as a user ID. Here's how you can extract and utilize this information in your Rails API:

### 1. **Decode the JWT**

When you decode the JWT received from the frontend, it reveals a payload containing several claims. Among these claims, you can find user-specific information. 

Using the `jwt` gem in Rails, you can decode the token like this:

```ruby
require 'jwt'

class ApiAuthentication
  def call(env)
    # ...
    auth_header = env['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION']
    token = auth_header.split(' ').last
    decoded_token = JWT.decode(token, supabase_public_key, true, { algorithm: 'RS256' })
    user_info = decoded_token[0] # The payload of the token
    # ...
  end

  # ...
end
```

### 2. **Extract User Information**

The payload (`user_info` in the above code) will  include the user's ID as assigned by Supabase. This ID is unique to each user. 

```ruby
user_id = user_info['sub'] # 'sub' is a standard claim in JWTs representing the subject (or user ID)
```

### 3. **Associate User ID with Your Data**

In your Rails models and database, you should have a way to associate user-specific data with this user ID. When you query your database for user data, use this ID to retrieve only the data associated with that specific user.

### 4. **Validate and Respond to Requests**

For each API request, after decoding the token and extracting the user ID, query your database for information related to this user. This way, you ensure that users can only access or modify their own data.

### 5. **Handle Exceptions**

If the token is invalid, expired, or doesn't have the required information, your middleware should handle these exceptions appropriately,  by sending a 401 Unauthorized response.

### 6. **Secure User Data**

Ensure that all user data handling adheres to best security practices to protect user information and comply with data protection laws.

### Example Controller Action Using User ID

In your controller actions, you can now use the extracted user ID to fetch or modify user-specific data:

```ruby
class SomeController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user

  def some_action
    # Assuming @current_user_id is set in the authenticate_user method
    user_data = UserData.find_by(user_id: @current_user_id)
    # ... handle user-specific data
  end
end
```

By following these steps, your Rails API will be able to identify the user associated with a valid token, allowing for secure and user-specific data handling.
