## Dependency Graph

What is the dependency graph of the Rails codebase from a contributor perspective?

From a contributor's perspective, understanding the dependency graph of the Rails codebase is crucial for effective development and maintenance. The dependency graph in Rails can be quite complex, given its modular architecture and extensive functionality. Here's an overview of the major components and their dependencies:

1. **Active Record**: 
   - Depends on Active Support for extended functionalities.
   - Optionally integrates with Active Model for validations and other features.
   - Interacts with Action Pack for web request handling related to database operations.

2. **Action Pack**:
   - Comprises Action Controller and Action View.
   - Relies heavily on Active Support for utility functions and extensions.
   - Action Controller interfaces with Active Record for database interactions in response to web requests.
   - Action View integrates with Active Record for presenting data.

3. **Action Mailer**:
   - Dependent on Action Pack for controller and view-like functionality in mailers.
   - Utilizes Active Support for extended features.

4. **Active Model**:
   - Provides an interface for models used in Action Pack.
   - Depends on Active Support for various functionalities.

5. **Active Job**:
   - Tightly integrated with Active Support.
   - Can interface with Active Record for database operations in background jobs.
   - Often used in conjunction with Action Mailer for background email processing.

6. **Active Storage**:
   - Leverages Active Record for managing attachments and blob records.
   - Depends on Active Support for various functionalities.

7. **Action Cable**:
   - Relies on Action Pack for integrating WebSockets with Rails applications.
   - Often interacts with Active Record for real-time features involving database updates.

8. **Active Support**:
   - The backbone of Rails, providing utility functions and language extensions.
   - A dependency for almost all other components in the Rails framework.

9. **Railties**:
   - The core of the Rails framework, responsible for orchestrating the initialization process.
   - Interacts with all other components to tie them together into a coherent framework.

10. **External Dependencies**:
    - Rails depends on several external libraries (gems), like Rack (a web server interface), Bundler (for managing gem dependencies), and others like database adapters.

Understanding this dependency graph is important for contributors to ensure that changes in one component do not adversely affect other parts of the framework. It also helps in diagnosing issues, optimizing performance, and adding new features in a way that aligns with the overall architecture of Rails.
