## Verify if a Bug is Valid

The assumption here is that the documentation is correct and the developer is not using the API as intended. This can be confirmed by reading the comments by other developers on the issue.

### Goal

Read the documentation and verify that the test case is using it as intended. 

Time: 15 Minutes

### Steps

1. Go to issues (with reproduction steps) (https://github.com/rails/rails/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22With+reproduction+steps%22)
2. Open the issue and read the test case. Read the documentation and make sure the test case uses the API as documented.
3. Verify that the test case works if you use the API as intended.

## Example

This issue [find_by is broken when passing an instance that uses composite primary keys](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50411) has a test case:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

require "bundler/inline"

gemfile(true) do
  source "https://rubygems.org"

  gem "activerecord", "7.1.2"
  gem "sqlite3"
end

require "active_record"
require "minitest/autorun"
require "logger"

# This connection will do for database-independent bug reports.
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: "sqlite3", database: ":memory:")
ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)

ActiveRecord::Schema.define do
  create_table :users, primary_key: [:id, :company_id], force: true do |t|
    t.integer :id
    t.integer :company_id
  end

  create_table :profiles, primary_key: :id, force: true do |t|
    t.integer :user_id
    t.integer :company_id
  end
end

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :profile
end

class Profile < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user, query_constraints: [:user_id, :company_id]
end

class BugTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_find_by
    user = User.create!(id: [1, 1])
    profile = Profile.create(id: 1, user_id: 1, company_id: 1)

    assert_equal profile, Profile.find_by(user: user)
  end
end
```

After reading the Rails API documentation, we can see it is not valid bug. The correct usage:

```ruby
assert_equal profile, Profile.find_by(user_id: user.id, company_id: user.company_id)
```

This makes the test case pass.
