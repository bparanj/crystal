## Good First Issue

[Add BACKTRACE env variable to turn off backtrace for normal running, not just tests](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50440)

The description is clear. 

### Goal

Make your first contribution.

### Steps 

1. Read the issue description.

In a Rails application, we can configure backtrace_cleaner:

```ruby
module YourApplication
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # ...

    # Disable backtrace cleaner if BACKTRACE env variable is set
    if ENV['BACKTRACE']
      config.backtrace_cleaner = nil
    end
  end
end
```

However we want to make the change to Rails framework codebase. 

2. Where is the functionality for backtrace_cleaner in the Rails codebase? Search the code on github by: /backtrace_cleaner

3. Identify the most relevant file that is likely to be changed. In this case, rails/railties/lib/rails/backtrace_cleaner.rb has BackTraceCleaner class.

4. Identify where to make the required change. In this class, the constructor needs to check the environment flag by wrapping the code section with `unless ENV['BACKTRACE']`. So the modified code would be:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

require "active_support/backtrace_cleaner"
require "active_support/core_ext/string/access"

module Rails
  class BacktraceCleaner < ActiveSupport::BacktraceCleaner # :nodoc:
    APP_DIRS_PATTERN = /\A(?:\.\/)?(?:app|config|lib|test|\(\w*\))/
    RENDER_TEMPLATE_PATTERN = /:in `.*_\w+_{2,3}\d+_\d+'/

    def initialize
      super

      unless ENV['BACKTRACE']
        @root = "#{Rails.root}/"
        add_filter do |line|
          line.start_with?(@root) ? line.from(@root.size) : line
        end
        add_filter do |line|
          if RENDER_TEMPLATE_PATTERN.match?(line)
            line.sub(RENDER_TEMPLATE_PATTERN, "")
          else
            line
          end
        end
        add_silencer { |line| !APP_DIRS_PATTERN.match?(line) }
      end
    end
  end
end
```

5. Post comment on the issues tracker to make sure the suggestion is correct before making the change.
