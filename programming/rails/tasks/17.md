## Dependency Isolation

Dependency isolation in Rails refers to the practice of designing your application in such a way that dependencies (external libraries, modules, etc.) are not tightly coupled with your core application logic. This approach increases modularity, makes your code easier to test, and simplifies maintenance and future changes. Let's go through some examples to illustrate this concept:

### 1. Using Service Objects

Service objects encapsulate business logic that might otherwise be spread across models or controllers. By isolating complex operations in service objects, you reduce the direct interaction between different parts of your application and external dependencies.

**Example**: Suppose you have a feature for processing payments. Instead of integrating the payment processing logic directly into your models or controllers, you create a service object:

```ruby
# app/services/payment_processor.rb
class PaymentProcessor
  def initialize(user, payment_details)
    @user = user
    @payment_details = payment_details
  end

  def process
    # Use an external payment gateway gem
    PaymentGateway.charge(@payment_details)
  end
end
```

In your controller:

```ruby
def create
  processor = PaymentProcessor.new(current_user, payment_params)
  if processor.process
    # Handle successful payment
  else
    # Handle failure
  end
end
```

This isolates the dependency on the external payment gateway within the `PaymentProcessor` service.

### 2. Abstracting External Libraries

Create wrapper modules or classes around external libraries. This way, if you need to replace a library, you only have to change the code in one place.

**Example**: If you're using a gem for sending emails, instead of using it directly throughout your application, you can create an abstraction:

```ruby
# app/lib/email_service.rb
module EmailService
  def self.send_email(to:, subject:, body:)
    SomeEmailLibrary.send(to: to, subject: subject, body: body)
  end
end
```

Use `EmailService` in your application:

```ruby
EmailService.send_email(to: user.email, subject: 'Welcome!', body: '...')
```

### 3. Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is a technique where objects are passed their dependencies (services, configurations, etc.) rather than creating them directly.

**Example**: Injecting a logger into a class, instead of having the class directly depend on a specific logging library:

```ruby
class UserProcessor
  def initialize(logger)
    @logger = logger
  end

  def process(user)
    @logger.info "Processing user #{user.id}"
    # ...
  end
end
```

When creating an instance of `UserProcessor`, you pass in the logger:

```ruby
logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
processor = UserProcessor.new(logger)
```

### Conclusion

Dependency isolation in Rails is about creating a clear boundary between your application's core logic and external libraries or services. This approach leads to cleaner, more maintainable code and makes it easier to adapt or change dependencies as your application evolves or if better tools become available.
