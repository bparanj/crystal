## Invariants

In the context of programming, an invariant refers to a condition or property that remains unchanged throughout the execution of a program or during the lifetime of an object or system. The concept of invariance can be applied at different stages of execution, and it's essential to differentiate between these stages:

1. **During Execution (Runtime Invariant)**:
    - This refers to properties or conditions that must hold true during the entire execution of a program or during specific phases of execution.
    - For example, in object-oriented programming, an object's invariant is a condition that must always hold true for the object after construction and between method calls.

2. **After Execution (Post-Execution Invariant)**:
    - These are conditions or properties that must be true after the program has finished executing or after a specific operation or method has completed.
    - Post-execution invariants are often used to verify that a function or method has correctly achieved its intended effect without violating the expected state of the system.

### Differences:

- **Nature**: Runtime invariants are concerned with maintaining consistency and correctness during the active phase of a program or operation. In contrast, post-execution invariants are about the end state after completion.
- **Verification**: Runtime invariants are  checked or enforced throughout the operation of a program or system, while post-execution invariants are evaluated after the completion of an operation or at the end of the program's execution.
- **Examples**:
    - **Runtime**: A class invariant in object-oriented programming ensures that an objectâ€™s internal state is valid during its lifetime.
    - **Post-Execution**: After a sort function, an invariant could be that the output array is in ascending order.

### Conclusion:

While the concept of an invariant is to maintain certain conditions, the specific invariants applicable during execution and after execution can be different. They serve different purposes: ensuring ongoing correctness and stability during operation and verifying the correctness of the final outcome.

Let's consider a simple example involving a bank account class in an object-oriented program to illustrate the concept of invariants during and after execution.

### Bank Account Class Example

Suppose we have a `BankAccount` class with two main operations: `deposit(amount)` and `withdraw(amount)`. The class also maintains a balance.

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 0  # Initial balance is zero

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount  # Increase balance by the deposit amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount  # Decrease balance by the withdrawal amount
        else:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")
```

### Invariants

1. **During Execution (Runtime Invariant):**
    - **Invariant**: The `balance` should never be negative.
    - **When It Applies**: This invariant applies throughout the operation of any method in the `BankAccount` class.
    - **Example**: When you call `withdraw(amount)`, the method checks to ensure that the withdrawal does not cause the balance to go negative.

2. **After Execution (Post-Execution Invariant):**
    - **Invariant**: After a successful deposit, the balance should increase by the deposit amount.
    - **When It Applies**: This is checked after the `deposit(amount)` method completes.
    - **Example**: If you deposit \$100, the post-execution invariant is that the balance should reflect an increase of \$100.

### Concrete Example:

```python
account = BankAccount()  # Create a new bank account

# Runtime Invariant Check: Balance should not be negative
assert account.balance >= 0, "Invariant violated: Balance is negative."

account.deposit(200)  # Deposit $200

# Post-Execution Invariant Check: Balance should be increased by $200
assert account.balance == 200, "Invariant violated: Deposit did not increase balance correctly."

try:
    account.withdraw(250)  # Try to withdraw $250
except ValueError:
    # Runtime Invariant maintained: Withdrawal did not proceed because it would make balance negative
    pass

# Final balance check
assert account.balance == 200, "Final balance check failed."
```

In this example, the runtime invariant ensures the stability and consistency of the bank account's state throughout its operation, while the post-execution invariant checks the correctness of the operations after they are performed.
