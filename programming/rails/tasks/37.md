## Rails Supported Service Providers

Sometimes developers open issue with reproducible script for service providers that is not supported out of the box. Example: [Action Mailbox mistakes attachment as body if no body exists](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50755).

Looked at the test case to reproduce the problem. Reduced it to the minimum by slowly deleting the email payload one line a time. 

Read the action mailer docs and found out there is no builtin support for SES. 

Simple search led to an open issue on Rails issues that is a known issue.

Posted the reduced test case and mentioned that there is already an open issue. Sometimes developers don't check their issue is already a known issue or not before opening a ticket.

Lesson learned: Read the documentation to see whether any service providers is supported out of the box in Rails or not.

Talking to my cousin Vinny also gave me a systematic way to approach this problem.
