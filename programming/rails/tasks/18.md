## Docker Setup for Ubuntu

To install Docker on Ubuntu 22.04, you can follow these steps. This process involves setting up the Docker repository and installing Docker from there, which ensures you get the latest version and can easily update it.

### 1. Update Software Repositories

First, update your existing list of packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### 2. Install Prerequisite Packages

Next, install a few prerequisite packages which let `apt` use packages over HTTPS:

```bash
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
```

### 3. Add Docker’s GPG Key

Now, add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

### 4. Add Docker Repository to APT Sources

Then, add the Docker repository to APT sources:

```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

### 5. Update Software Repositories Again

Update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### 6. Install Docker

Finally, install Docker:

```bash
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

### 7. Verify Docker Installation

After installation is complete, you can check if Docker is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

### 8. Running Docker Without `sudo` (Optional)

By default, running the Docker command requires administrator privileges. To run Docker commands without `sudo`, add your user to the `docker` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

To apply this new group membership, you can log out and log back in, or you can type the following:

```bash
su - ${USER}
```

### 9. Verify Docker Installation

You can verify your Docker installation and its version:

```bash
docker --version
```

### 10. Delete all Docker Images

```
docker system prune -a
```

### Important Notes:

- Always check the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for the most up-to-date instructions, as the process can change over time.
- Ensure that you don’t have older versions of Docker installed before beginning the new installation.
- The commands provided here are for a typical installation on Ubuntu 22.04. If you're using a different version or a different system setup, you might need to adjust these instructions accordingly.
