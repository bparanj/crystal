## Breno Gazzola

Easiest way to contribute is to be responsible for a production app running the latest rails version and work on it every day. You will eventually end up adding to your app something that does not exist in Rails, but might be useful so you can try to upstream it.

Another way is to run Rails Edge (point you gemfile to github: "rails/rails", branch: "main") have a good test suite and update often. You will eventually come across a change that breaks something in your app (but didn’t break in the other contributor’s app or rails CI), which will allow you to fix it.

## My Take

I like Breno Gazzola's idea. It does not have to be your Rails app. Take any popular Rails apps like:

- [eCommerce](https://github.com/spree/spree)
- [CMS](https://github.com/refinery/refinerycms)

You can run it locally against the Rails edge and see what breaks. Work on fixing it. If it is Rails related you can see if you fix it.
