## Identify Documentation Fixes

You have to read the comments to identify whether the test case given is due to wrong documentation.

[Using symbols when using 'to:' in routes.rb results in NoMethodError on startup #50465](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50465)

The language we use to communicate is ambiguous, the only way to understand is to write some code to see how the code works and fill in the missing gaps in our understanding.

I want to gain understanding of the issue and go beyond the language barrier.

Frame the right question first:

How to reproduce router related bugs?

[Rails API Documentation](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Routing.html) snippet:

Experiment:

```ruby
# In config/routes.rb
controller :blog do
  get 'blog/show',    to: :list
  get 'blog/delete',  to: :delete
  get 'blog/edit',    to: :edit
end
```

crashes the server when running rails server.


[Using symbols when using 'to:' in routes.rb results in NoMethodError on startup #50465](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50465)

Reproduce the issue:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

require "bundler/inline"

gemfile(true) do
  source "https://rubygems.org"

  git_source(:github) { |repo| "https://github.com/#{repo}.git" }

  gem "rails"
  # If you want to test against edge Rails replace the previous line with this:
  # gem "rails", github: "rails/rails", branch: "main"
end

require "action_controller/railtie"

class TestApp < Rails::Application
  config.root = __dir__
  config.hosts << "example.org"
  config.secret_key_base = "secret_key_base"

  config.logger = Logger.new($stdout)
  Rails.logger  = config.logger

  routes.draw do
    controller :blog do
      get 'blog/show',    to: :list
    end    
  end
end
```

Switch to fix mode. Changing the symbol to string:

```ruby
    controller :blog do
      get 'blog/show',    to: 'list'
    end   
```

will produce the error:

```

                raise ArgumentError, message
```
Correct usage:

```ruby
	controller :blog do
	  get 'blog/show',    to: 'blog#list'
	end    
```

## Documentation Verification

Rails app routes.rb:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Define your application routes per the DSL in https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html

  # Reveal health status on /up that returns 200 if the app boots with no exceptions, otherwise 500.
  # Can be used by load balancers and uptime monitors to verify that the app is live.
  get "up" => "rails/health#show", as: :rails_health_check

  controller :blog do
    get 'blog/show',    to: 'blog#list'
    get 'blog/delete',  to: 'blog#delete'
    get 'blog/edit',    to: 'blog#edit'
  end      

  # Defines the root path route ("/")
  # root "posts#index"
end
```

Output:

```
$ rails routes | grep blog

blog_show GET  /blog/show(.:format)                      blog#list
blog_delete GET  /blog/delete(.:format)                  blog#delete
blog_edit GET  /blog/edit(.:format)                       blog#edit
```
