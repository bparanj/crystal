## Classification of Invariants

Classifying invariants in software testing can be done based on different criteria, each offering a unique perspective on how these invariants contribute to the program's stability and correctness. Here's a classification based on various criteria:

1. **Based on Scope:**
   - **Local Invariants:** Related to local variables or conditions within a function or block of code.
   - **Global Invariants:** Concern the entire system or application, such as global data state or system-wide constraints.

2. **Based on Data:**
   - **State Invariants:** Concern the state of an object or system, ensuring that it remains consistent.
   - **Data Structure Invariants:** Specific to data structures, like a tree always being balanced or a list being sorted.

3. **Based on Functionality:**
   - **Functional Invariants:** Related to the functionality or output of a function, such as the output format or range.
   - **Behavioral Invariants:** Pertain to how a system behaves over time, often related to state transition systems.

4. **Based on Lifecycle:**
   - **Initialization Invariants:** Conditions that must be true after an object or system is initialized.
   - **Maintenance Invariants:** Conditions that must remain true during the lifetime of an object or system.

5. **Based on Dependency:**
   - **Independent Invariants:** Standalone conditions that do not rely on other invariants.
   - **Dependent Invariants:** Conditions that are based on or linked to other invariants.

6. **Based on Time:**
   - **Temporal Invariants:** Concern the timing or sequencing of events, such as the order in which functions must be called.

7. **Based on Interface:**
   - **Input/Output Invariants:** Relate to the inputs and outputs of a system or function, ensuring they adhere to specified formats or ranges.

8. **Based on Performance:**
   - **Performance Invariants:** Concern the performance aspects, like execution time or memory usage, remaining within defined bounds.

9. **Based on Reliability:**
   - **Error-Handling Invariants:** Ensure proper handling of errors and exceptional conditions.

Each classification highlights different aspects of invariants and can be instrumental in guiding developers and testers to identify, assert, and maintain them across various stages of software development and testing. This holistic approach ensures comprehensive coverage, leading to robust and reliable software.

## Code Examples

Let's go through each type of invariant with a simple example:

1. **Local Invariants:**
   - **Example:** In a function that calculates the square of a number, an invariant might be that the input (say, `x`) should always be non-negative within the function's scope.

   ```python
   def square(x):
       assert x >= 0  # Local invariant
       return x * x
   ```

2. **Global Invariants:**
   - **Example:** In a web application, a global user count should never be negative.

   ```python
   global_user_count = 10  # This should always be >= 0
   ```

3. **State Invariants:**
   - **Example:** An object representing a bank account should never have a negative balance.

   ```python
   class BankAccount:
       def __init__(self, balance):
           assert balance >= 0  # State invariant
           self.balance = balance
   ```

4. **Data Structure Invariants:**
   - **Example:** In a binary search tree, an invariant is that for each node, all values in the left subtree are less than the node's value.

5. **Functional Invariants:**
   - **Example:** A function that calculates the absolute value of a number should always return a non-negative result.

   ```python
   def absolute_value(x):
       result = abs(x)
       assert result >= 0  # Functional invariant
       return result
   ```

6. **Behavioral Invariants:**
   - **Example:** A state machine that handles user login states should never transition from a 'logged out' state directly to a 'logged in' state without credentials verification.

7. **Initialization Invariants:**
   - **Example:** After initializing a new game board in chess, an invariant is that the number of pieces for each player should be equal.

8. **Maintenance Invariants:**
   - **Example:** In a running application, the configuration file's location must remain constant.

9. **Independent Invariants:**
   - **Example:** The maximum size of a stack should always be a positive integer, regardless of the stack's current state.

10. **Dependent Invariants:**
    - **Example:** In a parent-child hierarchy, a child's `parentId` should always match the `id` of one of the parent entities.

11. **Temporal Invariants:**
    - **Example:** In a logging system, the timestamps of log entries should always be in non-decreasing order.

    ```python
    last_logged_time = None

    def log_event(current_time, message):
        global last_logged_time
        assert last_logged_time is None or current_time >= last_logged_time  # Temporal invariant
        last_logged_time = current_time
        # log message
    ```

12. **Input/Output Invariants:**
    - **Example:** A function that reads a file and returns its content as a string should always return the same string for the same file (assuming the file hasn't changed).

    ```python
    def read_file(file_path):
        content = read_file_content(file_path)
        assert isinstance(content, str)  # I/O invariant
        return content
    ```

13. **Performance Invariants:**
    - **Example:** A sorting algorithm should always sort an array within its defined time complexity, say O(n log n) for a merge sort.

14. **Error-Handling Invariants:**
    - **Example:** A database query should always handle a connection error by either retrying or raising a specific exception.

    ```python
    def query_database(query):
        try:
            # Execute query
        except DatabaseConnectionError:
            # Handle error
            assert False  # Error-handling invariant
    ```

Each of these examples illustrates a specific type of invariant, demonstrating the various ways in which invariants can manifest themselves in software systems. They help maintain the consistency, reliability, and predictability of the software.

## Invariant Classification for PBT

Not all the listed invariants are directly applicable or  used in property-based testing (PBT). Property-based testing primarily focuses on verifying the properties of a program that should hold true for a wide range of inputs, often under various conditions. Let's look at which of the invariants are most relevant to PBT:

1. **Local Invariants:** 
   - Typically not the focus of PBT, as they are more relevant within the scope of unit tests for individual functions.

2. **Global Invariants:**
   - Can be relevant in PBT, especially when testing system-wide properties or behaviors that should remain consistent regardless of different inputs or states.

3. **State Invariants:**
   - Highly relevant in PBT, as they involve testing consistent states of objects or systems under various input conditions. PBT can effectively validate these invariants across a wide range of scenarios.

4. **Data Structure Invariants:**
   - Very applicable to PBT. For example, testing that a tree structure maintains its invariants (like balancing) under various operations (insertions, deletions) with different data sets.

5. **Functional Invariants:**
   - Directly applicable to PBT. These invariants relate to the consistent output or behavior of a function given different inputs, which is a core aspect of PBT.

6. **Behavioral Invariants:**
   - Potentially applicable in PBT, especially in systems where state transitions or behavior sequences need to be validated under varied conditions.

7. **Initialization Invariants:**
   - Could be tested using PBT, particularly to ensure that objects or systems are correctly initialized under various conditions.

8. **Maintenance Invariants:**
   - Can be applicable in PBT, especially for long-running systems or applications where certain conditions must hold true throughout the system's lifecycle.

9. **Independent Invariants:**
   - Relevant in PBT, as these invariants are standalone and can be easily tested against a range of inputs.

10. **Dependent Invariants:**
    - These can be tested in PBT, especially when the relationship between different parts of the system needs to be validated under various scenarios.

11. **Temporal Invariants:**
    - Applicable in scenarios where timing or order of operations is crucial. PBT can be used to test these aspects under different sequences of events.

12. **Input/Output Invariants:**
    - Highly relevant in PBT for testing the consistency of a function or system's output given various inputs.

13. **Performance Invariants:**
    - Not  the focus of PBT, as performance testing often requires different methodologies and tools.

14. **Error-Handling Invariants:**
    - Can be tested using PBT, particularly to ensure consistent handling of errors under various failure scenarios.

In summary, while not all invariants listed are  used in PBT, many of them, especially those related to the consistent behavior of functions or systems across a range of inputs and conditions, are very relevant and form the basis of property-based testing strategies.

Here's a table summarizing the applicability of different types of invariants to Property-Based Testing (PBT):

| Type of Invariant        | Applicability to PBT |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Local Invariants         | Less Applicable      |
| Global Invariants        | Applicable           |
| State Invariants         | Highly Applicable    |
| Data Structure Invariants| Highly Applicable    |
| Functional Invariants    | Highly Applicable    |
| Behavioral Invariants    | Applicable           |
| Initialization Invariants| Applicable           |
| Maintenance Invariants   | Applicable           |
| Independent Invariants   | Applicable           |
| Dependent Invariants     | Applicable           |
| Temporal Invariants      | Applicable           |
| Input/Output Invariants  | Highly Applicable    |
| Performance Invariants   | Less Applicable      |
| Error-Handling Invariants| Applicable           |

- **Highly Applicable:** Invariants that are particularly suited for testing with PBT due to their general nature or because they involve validating consistent behavior across a wide range of inputs.
- **Applicable:** Invariants that can be tested with PBT, especially useful when the focus is on ensuring system-wide properties or specific behaviors under various conditions and inputs.
- **Less Applicable:** These invariants are not  the primary focus of PBT. They might be better tested with other testing methodologies, such as unit testing or performance testing.

This table provides a guideline on how various invariants fit into the framework of property-based testing, helping to determine the most effective testing strategies for different aspects of a program's behavior and characteristics.

Grouping the invariants by their order of applicability to Property-Based Testing (PBT), we can categorize them into three groups: Highly Applicable, Applicable, and Less Applicable.

1. **Highly Applicable:**
   - Functional Invariants
   - Data Structure Invariants
   - Input/Output Invariants
   - State Invariants

2. **Applicable:**
   - Global Invariants
   - Behavioral Invariants
   - Initialization Invariants
   - Maintenance Invariants
   - Independent Invariants
   - Dependent Invariants
   - Temporal Invariants
   - Error-Handling Invariants

3. **Less Applicable:**
   - Local Invariants
   - Performance Invariants

This grouping helps in prioritizing which types of invariants to focus on when designing property-based tests. The "Highly Applicable" category should  be the primary focus, as these invariants are most suited to the strengths of PBT. The "Applicable" category can be included as needed, based on the specific requirements and context of the testing scenario. The "Less Applicable" invariants might be better tested using other methodologies, but they can still be included in PBT if they are relevant to the test objectives.
