### Visualizing Frequency of Changes

Devise a simple process or tool to visualize the frequency of changes on specific files or file areas for Rails framework codebase.

To visualize the frequency of changes in specific files or areas of the Rails framework codebase, you can create a tool or process that leverages version control history and data visualization techniques. Here's a simple process to achieve this:

1. **Select a Version Control Tool**:
   - Use Git, as it's the version control system for Rails.

2. **Extract Commit Data**:
   - Use Git commands to extract the commit history. The `git log` command can be tailored to show changes for specific files or directories. For example:
     ```
     git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s" -- <file_path>
     ```
   - To get a count of commits affecting each file, you can use:
     ```
     git log --pretty=format: --name-only | sort | uniq -c | sort -rg
     ```

3. **Parse and Aggregate Data**:
   - Write a script (in Ruby, Python, or any language you prefer) to parse the output of Git commands.
   - The script should organize data to reflect the frequency of changes per file or directory over time.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use a data visualization library or tool to create graphs or charts from the aggregated data. Tools like D3.js for web-based visualization, or Python libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly, can be used.
   - Create visualizations such as bar charts or heat maps that represent the frequency of changes.

5. **Automate the Process**:
   - Wrap the entire process in a script or a small application.
   - Allow parameters like date ranges, specific directories, or file types to customize the analysis.

6. **Web Interface (Optional)**:
   - For ease of use, you could create a simple web interface where users can input parameters (file paths, date range) and view the visualizations directly.

7. **Documentation and Sharing**:
   - Document how to use the tool and share it with your team or the Rails community.

This tool would provide valuable insights into which parts of the Rails codebase are most frequently changed, helping to identify hotspots for refactoring, areas that may need more testing, or simply areas of high activity and interest.
