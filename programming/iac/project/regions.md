Here's an example of how you can modify your Packer template using HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) to copy the AMI to multiple regions:

```hcl
source "amazon-ebs" "example" {
  region        = "us-west-2"
  source_ami    = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ssh_username  = "ec2-user"
  ami_name      = "my-ami-${formatdate("YYYY-MM-DD-hhmm", timestamp())}"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.amazon-ebs.example"]

  provisioner "shell" {
    script = "setup.sh"
  }

  post-processor "amazon-ami-management" {
    regions       = ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
    keep_releases = 3
  }

  post-processor "manifest" {
    output = "manifest.json"
  }
}
```

In this HCL example:

1. The `source` block defines the configuration for creating the AMI in the `us-west-2` region using the `amazon-ebs` builder.

2. The `build` block contains the build configuration.

3. The `sources` attribute specifies the source(s) to use for the build. In this case, it references the `amazon-ebs` source defined earlier.

4. The `provisioner` block specifies any provisioning steps or scripts to be executed during the AMI creation process.

5. The `post-processor` blocks define the post-processing steps to be performed after the AMI is created.

6. The `amazon-ami-management` post-processor is used to manage the AMI after it is created. It takes the following attributes:
   - `regions`: An array of regions to which the AMI should be copied. In this example, the AMI will be copied to `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`, and `ap-southeast-1` regions.
   - `keep_releases`: The number of AMI releases to keep in each region. Older releases will be deregistered.

7. The `manifest` post-processor is used to generate a manifest file (`manifest.json`) that contains information about the created AMI and its copies in different regions.

When you run this Packer template using the HCL configuration, Packer will create the AMI in the `us-west-2` region and then automatically copy it to the specified regions (`us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`, and `ap-southeast-1`) as part of the post-processing step.

Make sure you have the necessary AWS permissions to copy AMIs across regions. The IAM user or role associated with the Packer build should have the required permissions to perform the AMI copy operation.

By using the `amazon-ami-management` post-processor in your Packer template with HCL, you can automate the process of copying the AMI to multiple regions directly within Packer, eliminating the need for separate scripts or manual steps.
