To set the `secret_key_base` for your Rails application's production environment outside of Ansible, you can follow these steps:

1. **Using Rails Credentials**:

   - Ensure you have Rails 5.2 or newer, as this version introduced encrypted credentials.
   - In your local development environment, open a terminal.
   - Run `RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails credentials:edit`. This command opens the encrypted credentials file in your default editor. If you haven't set up credentials before, Rails will guide you to create a new master key (`config/master.key`) that should be kept secret.
   - Inside the credentials file, add or ensure there's a section for the production environment and set the `secret_key_base`:
     ```yaml
     production:
       secret_key_base: your_new_generated_secret_key_base
     ```
   - Save and close the file. Rails automatically encrypts and saves your changes.
   - Commit the changes to `config/credentials.yml.enc` to your version control system. **Do not commit `config/master.key`**. Ensure it is in your `.gitignore` file if you are using Git.
   - On your production server or environment, make sure the `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` environment variable is set to the value of your `config/master.key` or place the `master.key` file in the `config` directory. This allows Rails to decrypt the credentials on the server.

2. **Using Environment Variables**:
   - Generate a new `secret_key_base` by running `bin/rails secret` in your terminal. This command outputs a secure random string that you can use.
   - Set this generated string as an environment variable in your production environment. The method to do this depends on how your server or hosting environment is configured. For example, you might add it to your `.bashrc` or `.profile`, or use a service like Docker, Heroku, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk that allows you to configure environment variables through their interface.
   - In your `.bashrc` or `.profile`, you might add:
     ```bash
     export SECRET_KEY_BASE="your_new_generated_secret_key_base"
     ```
   - Remember to source the file or restart your terminal session to apply these changes. For server environments, ensure the environment variable is loaded where your application is running.

Using Rails credentials is a secure way to manage your secrets, as it ensures they are encrypted and only decryptable in the environment where you have the corresponding master key. The environment variable method is more straightforward but requires careful handling to keep your secrets secure.

To use the `vi` editor (or `vim` if you prefer) for editing Rails credentials, you need to set the `VISUAL` or `EDITOR` environment variable to `vi` before running the `credentials:edit` command. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Temporary Assignment**:

   - For a one-time edit, you can prefix your command with `EDITOR="vi"` or `VISUAL="vi"`. This sets the environment variable for the duration of the command.
   - Run:
     ```
     EDITOR="vi" RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails credentials:edit
     ```
   - This command temporarily sets `vi` as the editor, opens the credentials file in `vi`, and applies the `RAILS_ENV=production` environment variable.

2. **Permanent Assignment**:
   - To permanently set `vi` as your default editor, you can add the `EDITOR` or `VISUAL` environment variable assignment to your shell’s profile script (e.g., `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, depending on your shell).
   - Add the following line to your profile script:
     ```
     export EDITOR="vi"
     ```
   - Save the file and reload your profile (e.g., by running `source ~/.bash_profile` or simply opening a new terminal window).
   - Now, you can run `RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails credentials:edit` without specifying the editor, and it will automatically use `vi`.

**Note**: If you’re not familiar with `vi`/`vim`, here are a few basic commands to get started:

- To enter insert mode (so you can start typing), press `i`.
- To save changes and exit, first press `Esc` to ensure you're not in insert mode, then type `:wq` and press `Enter`.
- To exit without saving changes, press `Esc` and type `:q!` and press `Enter`.

The error message you're seeing suggests that Rails is unable to decrypt `config/credentials.yml.enc` because the key in `config/master.key` does not match or the `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` environment variable is not set correctly. Here's how to address this issue:

1. **Ensure You Have the Correct Master Key**:

   - The master key used to decrypt the credentials must match the key that was used to encrypt them. This key is usually found in `config/master.key` or set as an environment variable (`RAILS_MASTER_KEY`).
   - If you are working in a team or a project cloned from a repository, make sure you've obtained the correct `master.key` file from a secure source or have the correct master key to set as an environment variable.

2. **Set RAILS_MASTER_KEY Environment Variable (If Not Using `master.key` File)**:

   - If the `config/master.key` file does not exist or you prefer not to use it, you can set the master key as an environment variable.
   - You can temporarily set the environment variable in your terminal session:
     ```bash
     export RAILS_MASTER_KEY=your_master_key_here
     ```
   - Then try editing the credentials again:
     ```bash
     RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails credentials:edit
     ```
   - Remember to replace `your_master_key_here` with your  master key.

3. **Check for Typos in the Master Key**:

   - Double-check that you haven't made a typo when entering the master key. It needs to be exactly the same as when the credentials were encrypted.

4. **Regenerate Credentials (If Necessary)**:

   - If you cannot recover the correct master key, you might need to regenerate your credentials and `master.key`, but be aware this means you'll lose access to any secrets stored in the existing encrypted file. To regenerate:
     ```bash
     rm config/credentials.yml.enc
     rm config/master.key
     RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails credentials:edit
     ```
   - This will create a new `master.key` and `credentials.yml.enc` file that you can then edit. Make sure to securely store the newly generated `master.key`.

5. **Using an Editor**:
   - If you're using the `EDITOR` environment variable to specify your editor, make sure it's set before running the command. For `vi`, you can do this by running:
     ```bash
     EDITOR="vi" RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails credentials:edit
     ```

If you're still having trouble, ensure there are no issues with your Rails setup or version and that you're following the correct procedure for your specific Rails version.

To source the `bashrc` file within an Ansible playbook, you generally use the `ansible.builtin.shell` module with a command that sources `bashrc` before executing your intended command. This is because sourcing is a shell operation that initializes environment variables and executes commands in the context of the shell session. Here's a basic example of how to do this:

```yaml
- name: Execute a command after sourcing .bashrc
  ansible.builtin.shell: |
    source ~/.bashrc
    # Your command here
  args:
    executable: /bin/bash
```

If you need to run a command as a specific user and source their `.bashrc`, you can use the `become` and `become_user` directives to switch users. However, note that directly sourcing `.bashrc` might not always work as expected in non-interactive shells (like when running commands through Ansible), since `.bashrc` may contain conditions that exit early if the shell is not interactive.

A more reliable approach might involve directly exporting the needed environment variables within the task or  a specific script to set up the environment. Here's an adjusted example where you source `.bashrc` and run a command, ensuring that the `.bashrc` execution context is suitable for your operation:

```yaml
- name: Source .bashrc and execute a command
  ansible.builtin.shell: |
    # Ensure the shell behaves as if it's login and interactive to properly source .bashrc
    exec /bin/bash -l -i -c 'source ~/.bashrc && your_command_here'
  args:
    executable: /bin/bash
  become: true
  become_user: target_user
```

In this example, `your_command_here` is the command you wish to run after sourcing `.bashrc`, and `target_user` is the user whose `.bashrc` you want to source. Remember to replace these placeholders with your  command and user.

Using `exec /bin/bash -l -i -c` ensures that the shell is treated as both login (`-l`) and interactive (`-i`), which can help in sourcing `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` correctly. However, this method should be used cautiously and tested thoroughly, as it can lead to different behavior depending on how `.bashrc` is configured and the environment it expects.

The error message you're encountering, `ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor::InvalidMessage`,  indicates a problem with the decryption of the encrypted credentials or master key in a Rails application. This can happen if the `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` is not set correctly or if the encrypted credentials file (`config/credentials.yml.enc`) cannot be decrypted with the provided key. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and potentially fix this issue:

1. **Ensure the Master Key is Set**: The Rails master key used to decrypt `config/credentials.yml.enc` should be set in an environment variable named `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`. Make sure this environment variable is present and correctly set in the environment where you're running the Rails application.

2. **Check for Environment-Specific Credentials**: If you're using environment-specific credentials (e.g., `config/credentials/production.yml.enc`), ensure that the corresponding master key (e.g., `config/credentials/production.key`) is available or that the appropriate environment variable is set.

3. **Regenerate Credentials If Necessary**: If the credentials file is corrupted or if you're unsure about the master key, consider regenerating the credentials. Be cautious with this approach because it will overwrite any existing secrets. You can regenerate credentials with:

   ```bash
   EDITOR="nano --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit
   ```

   Replace `"nano --wait"` with your preferred editor. Note that regenerating credentials should be done with an understanding of what secrets are currently used and ensuring they are backed up or noted elsewhere, as this approach will replace them.

4. **Set Environment Variables in Ansible**: To ensure that environment variables like `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` are correctly set when running Rails tasks with Ansible, you can use the `environment` option in your playbook tasks. For example:

   ```yaml
   - name: Run Rails db:create and db:migrate
     ansible.builtin.command:
       cmd: bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
     args:
       chdir: "/var/www/rails-docs/"
     environment:
       RAILS_MASTER_KEY: "{{ rails_master_key }}"
       RAILS_ENV: "production"
   ```

   Replace `"{{ rails_master_key }}"` with the  master key value or a variable representing it.

5. **Verify File Permissions**: Ensure that the user running the Rails commands has the necessary permissions to read the credentials and key files. You might encounter permission issues if the files cannot be accessed by the user running the Rails application.

If you're still encountering issues, consider examining the Rails logs for more detailed error messages that could provide further insight into the decryption failure.

Ansible doesn't automatically pick up the `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` value unless it is explicitly provided in your playbook, environment variables, or Ansible Vault for secure storage and access.

The `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` is  used in Rails applications to decrypt encrypted credentials. If your application requires this key, you need to ensure that it's accessible during your Ansible deployments, especially when running commands that depend on Rails credentials.

Here are some ways to provide the `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`:

1. **Environment Variable in Playbook**: You can pass the `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` as an environment variable directly in your Ansible playbook tasks:

   ```yaml
   - name: Run Rails db:migrate
     ansible.builtin.command:
       cmd: bundle exec rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
     environment:
       RAILS_ENV: production
       RAILS_MASTER_KEY: "{{ rails_master_key }}"
     args:
       chdir: "/path/to/your/rails/app"
   ```

   In this snippet, `{{ rails_master_key }}` would be a variable you've defined elsewhere in your playbook or loaded from an Ansible Vault.

2. **Ansible Vault**: For security, store your `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` in an Ansible Vault and load it as a variable within your playbook. This approach keeps your sensitive information encrypted when not in use.

   First, create a vault:

   ```bash
   ansible-vault create secret_vars.yml
   ```

   Then add your master key inside:

   ```yaml
   rails_master_key: your_master_key_here
   ```

   Use it in your playbook with `vars_files`:

   ```yaml
   vars_files:
     - secret_vars.yml
   ```

3. **Inline with `ansible-playbook` Command**: You can also pass the `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` at runtime via the `ansible-playbook` command using the `--extra-vars` option:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook deploy.yml --extra-vars "rails_master_key=yourmasterkey"
   ```

Regardless of the method you choose, ensure that the `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` is securely managed and not exposed in plaintext in your version control or accessible logs.

Yes, placing `rails_master_key: your_master_key_here` inside a `secret_vars.yml` file and using Ansible's `include_vars` module to include this file in your playbook allows you to securely manage sensitive data. This approach keeps sensitive values like the Rails master key out of your main playbook files and source control. Make sure to encrypt the `secret_vars.yml` file using Ansible Vault to enhance security further.

Yes, that's correct. You should manually create the `secret_vars.yml` file first, populate it with your sensitive data like the `rails_master_key`, and then run your Ansible playbook. If you're using Ansible Vault, remember to encrypt this file using `ansible-vault encrypt secret_vars.yml` before running your playbook, ensuring your sensitive data is securely stored. To use the encrypted file during the playbook run, you'll either include the vault password through a prompt, a file, or other methods Ansible provides for handling vault passwords.

The error message indicates a problem with the encryption key used by Rails, specifically with Active Support's `MessageEncryptor`. The `key must be 16 bytes` error means that the encryption key being used does not meet the required length for the cipher algorithm. This usually relates to the `secret_key_base` or the `rails_master_key` if you're using encrypted credentials.

### Solutions:

1. **Check `secret_key_base`:** Ensure your `secret_key_base` is of the correct length. This key is  found in the `credentials.yml.enc` file (for Rails 5.2+) or in the `secrets.yml` for older versions. If you're setting it through environment variables, ensure the environment variable is correctly set.

2. **Generate a new `secret_key_base`:** You can generate a new `secret_key_base` by running `bin/rails secret` in your Rails application directory. This command generates a new secret key of the correct length. You can then set this key as your `secret_key_base`.

3. **Check `rails_master_key`:** If you're using Rails encrypted credentials, ensure your `rails_master_key` is present and correct. The `rails_master_key` should be in a file named `config/master.key` (not committed to version control) or set as an environment variable. This key is used to decrypt `credentials.yml.enc`.

4. **Correct Usage in Ansible:** If you're passing the `rails_master_key` through Ansible, ensure it's correctly applied in your tasks. You might be passing it as an environment variable to your Rails commands:

   ```yaml
   - name: Run Rails db:migrate
     ansible.builtin.command:
       cmd: bundle exec rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
     environment:
       RAILS_MASTER_KEY: "{{ rails_master_key }}"
     args:
       chdir: "/var/www/rails-docs/"
   ```

   Make sure `rails_master_key` is defined in your `secret_vars.yml` or wherever you're storing secure variables, and it's correctly referenced in your playbook.

5. **Manually Editing Encrypted Credentials:** If you need to update or set the `secret_key_base` in your encrypted credentials, use:

   ```bash
   EDITOR="nano --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit --environment production
   ```

   Make sure to replace `"nano --wait"` with your preferred editor. This opens the encrypted credentials file where you can set the `secret_key_base`.

Review and apply these solutions based on your setup and where you suspect the issue might be originating.

To set `secret_key_base` in a `config/secrets.yml` file for a Ruby on Rails application, follow these steps:

1. **Open or Create `secrets.yml` File**: Navigate to the `config` directory of your Rails application. If a `secrets.yml` file doesn't exist, create one.

2. **Edit the `secrets.yml` File**: Open the `secrets.yml` file in a text editor. This file allows you to define secrets for different environments (development, test, production, etc.).

3. **Set `secret_key_base` for Each Environment**: You'll need to set a unique `secret_key_base` for each environment. It's crucial for security reasons that each environment (especially production) uses a unique secret key. You can generate a new secret key by running `rails secret` in the terminal. Here's an example configuration:

   ```yaml
   development:
     secret_key_base: <development_secret_here>

   test:
     secret_key_base: <test_secret_here>

   production:
     secret_key_base: <%= ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE"] %>
   ```

   For the development and test environments, you can paste the keys directly. However, for production, it's a best practice to load the `secret_key_base` from an environment variable (`ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE"]`). This approach keeps your production key secure.

4. **Generate a Secret Key**: If you haven't already, generate a secret key by running `rails secret` in your terminal. This command outputs a random key that you can use.

5. **Set the Production Secret Key**: For the production environment, it's recommended not to hard-code the secret key. Instead, set an environment variable `SECRET_KEY_BASE` on your production server with the value generated by `rails secret`. How you do this depends on your hosting environment. For example, in a Unix-like environment, you might add the following to your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.profile`, or set it directly in your web server or application server's configuration:

   ```bash
   export SECRET_KEY_BASE="paste_your_generated_key_here"
   ```

6. **Use the Secrets**: Rails automatically loads the `secrets.yml` file, and you can access any defined secrets using `Rails.application.secrets`. For example, you can access the `secret_key_base` for the current environment with `Rails.application.secrets.secret_key_base`.

Remember to restart your Rails server after making changes to the `secrets.yml` file for the changes to take effect. Also, ensure you do not commit your production secret keys to version control - consider using `.gitignore` to exclude the `secrets.yml` file for extra security, especially if you are defining production secrets directly in the file instead of using environment variables.

Yes, you can use the generated secret for `secret_key_base` as an extra argument when running Ansible, especially if you need to ensure that your Rails application has the necessary `secret_key_base` set for production. However, directly passing sensitive information like `secret_key_base` as an extra argument in the command line is not recommended due to security concerns, as it can be exposed in logs or command history.

Instead, consider using one of these approaches:

1. **Environment Variables**: Set `secret_key_base` as an environment variable on the server where your Rails application is deployed. Rails applications automatically use the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` environment variable for the production `secret_key_base` if it's available.

2. **Ansible Vault**: Store your `secret_key_base` and any other sensitive variables in an encrypted file using Ansible Vault. You can then use this vault file in your playbook to set the environment variable for `secret_key_base`.

Example using Ansible Vault:

1. Create an encrypted file with Ansible Vault:
   ```bash
   ansible-vault create secret_vars.yml
   ```
2. Add your secret_key_base to this file:
   ```yaml
   secret_key_base: YOUR_SECRET_KEY_BASE_HERE
   ```
3. In your playbook, use the vault file and set the environment variable for your deployment task or role:
   ```yaml
   - hosts: your_servers
     vars_files:
       - secret_vars.yml
     tasks:
       - name: Set SECRET_KEY_BASE for Rails
         ansible.builtin.shell:
           cmd: "export SECRET_KEY_BASE={{ secret_key_base }}"
   ```
4. Run your playbook with the vault password:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
   ```

This way, `secret_key_base` is securely passed and set as an environment variable for your Rails application without exposing it directly in your command line arguments or playbook files.

To set the value of `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` in Ansible, you can use an environment variable within your playbook task that runs Rails commands. Here's how to do it:

```yaml
- name: Run Rails command with RAILS_MASTER_KEY
  ansible.builtin.command:
    cmd: rails some_command
  environment:
    RAILS_MASTER_KEY: "{{ rails_master_key }}"
```

In this snippet, `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` is set as an environment variable for the command task. The value `{{ rails_master_key }}` is a placeholder for the  master key, which you should replace with your key or reference from a variable defined elsewhere in your playbook or in an external variables file.

To securely manage your `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`, you can:

1. **Define it in a variables file**, like `vars.yml`, and encrypt this file using Ansible Vault:

   ```yaml
   rails_master_key: your_master_key_here
   ```

   Then, load this file in your playbook:

   ```yaml
   - name: My Playbook
     hosts: all
     vars_files:
       - vars.yml
     tasks:
       - name: Run Rails command with RAILS_MASTER_KEY
         ansible.builtin.command:
           cmd: rails some_command
         environment:
           RAILS_MASTER_KEY: "{{ rails_master_key }}"
   ```

   Make sure to encrypt `vars.yml` with `ansible-vault encrypt vars.yml` and provide the vault password when running the playbook.

2. **Pass it as an extra variable** at the command line when running your playbook, ensuring not to expose the key in your command history:

   ```
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml --extra-vars "rails_master_key=your_master_key_here"
   ```

   This approach is less secure than using Ansible Vault, as it risks exposing the key in your shell's history or logs.

3. **Use Ansible Vault directly in the playbook** to prompt for the master key securely:
   ```yaml
   - name: Run Rails command with RAILS_MASTER_KEY
     ansible.builtin.command:
       cmd: rails some_command
     environment:
       RAILS_MASTER_KEY: !vault |
         $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
         663864396532363739643732626639663531666564383466...
   ```
   This embeds the encrypted master key directly in your playbook. You'll need to replace the encrypted string with your  encrypted `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`, which you can generate using `ansible-vault encrypt_string`.

Choose the method that best fits your security practices and operational environment.
