The issue you're facing with accessing `https://www.clickplan.net` (but not `https://clickplan.net`) suggests a problem with the SSL certificate configuration for the `www` subdomain. Here's how you can troubleshoot and potentially fix the issue:

### 1. Check DNS Configuration

Ensure that both `clickplan.net` and `www.clickplan.net` are correctly pointing to your server where Caddy is running. You can use DNS lookup tools like `dig` or `nslookup` to verify this:

```bash
dig +noall +answer clickplan.net
dig +noall +answer www.clickplan.net
```

Both should point to the same IP address where your Caddy server is hosted.

### 2. Verify Caddy Configuration

Make sure your Caddyfile (or equivalent configuration) correctly handles both the root domain (`clickplan.net`) and the `www` subdomain (`www.clickplan.net`). If you're serving the same content on both, you might have a configuration block like this:

```caddy
clickplan.net, www.clickplan.net {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
    # Other directives as needed, like automatic HTTPS
}
```

This ensures Caddy automatically obtains and renews SSL certificates for both domains through Let's Encrypt (or your specified CA).

### 3. Check SSL Certificate

Ensure that the SSL certificate covers both the root domain and the `www` subdomain. If you're using Caddy, it  handles this for you, but verifying can be useful. You can inspect the certificate with:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect clickplan.net:443 -servername clickplan.net | openssl x509 -noout -text
openssl s_client -connect www.clickplan.net:443 -servername www.clickplan.net | openssl x509 -noout -text
```

Look for the `Subject Alternative Name` section and check if both `clickplan.net` and `www.clickplan.net` are included.

### 4. Review Caddy Logs

Caddy's logs may offer insights into what's happening when it attempts to serve `https://www.clickplan.net`. Look for error messages related to SSL certificate provisioning or domain resolution issues.

### 5. Force Caddy to Renew Certificates

If you suspect the certificate is the problem (perhaps it didn't include `www.clickplan.net` initially), you can force Caddy to renew its certificates. The method depends on your Caddy version and setup, but often restarting Caddy can trigger a renewal if it detects certificate issues.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart caddy
```

### 6. Ensure Redirection Logic

If your intention is to redirect `www.clickplan.net` to `clickplan.net` (or vice versa), ensure you have correctly configured redirection in your Caddyfile.

```caddy
www.clickplan.net {
    redir https://clickplan.net{uri}
}
```

This setup is if you're choosing to serve content primarily under the root domain and redirect `www` to it.

### Next Steps

If these steps don't resolve the issue, consider:

- Checking for any firewall or network configuration that might differ between the root domain and the subdomain.
- Ensuring there's no typo or misconfiguration specifically associated with the `www` subdomain in your DNS settings or Caddy configuration.
- Consulting Caddy's community forums or support channels for more domain-specific advice.
