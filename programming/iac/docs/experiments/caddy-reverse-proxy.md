## How to Set Up Caddy as a Reverse Proxy

To modify the playbook so that Caddy acts as a reverse proxy for `http://localhost:9292/`, you need to change the `Caddyfile` configuration. Here's how the playbook should be adjusted:

```yaml
---
- name: Install and Configure Caddy Server
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Import Caddy's official signing key
      ansible.builtin.apt_key:
        url: https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key
        state: present

    - name: Add Caddy's official repository
      ansible.builtin.apt_repository:
        repo: deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/caddy/ /
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install Caddy
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: caddy
        state: latest

    - name: Create Caddyfile for reverse proxy
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        dest: /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
        content: |
          :80 {
              reverse_proxy http://localhost:9292/
          }
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: "0644"
      notify: restart caddy

  handlers:
    - name: restart caddy
      ansible.builtin.systemd:
        name: caddy
        state: restarted
        enabled: yes
```

This configuration sets up Caddy to listen on port 80 and reverse proxy all incoming requests to `http://localhost:9292/`, where your application is running. The `reverse_proxy` directive in the `Caddyfile` is what enables this behavior.
