Review this https://github.com/bparanj/learning-nuxt/blob/main/iac/docs/ansible/ec2.md and merge with:

To create an Ansible playbook that sets up the AWS infrastructure defined by your Terraform configuration, you'll need to use the Ansible modules for AWS, such as `community.aws.ec2_vpc_net`, `community.aws.ec2_subnet`, `community.aws.ec2_igw`, `community.aws.ec2_route_table`, `community.aws.ec2_security_group`, and `community.aws.ec2_instance`. You'll also need to ensure you have the necessary AWS credentials and permissions.

Below is an example Ansible playbook that mirrors the functionality of your Terraform configuration. Note that Ansible playbooks for AWS require the AWS CLI or SDKs (Boto/Boto3) to be configured properly with your credentials.

This playbook assumes you have defined variables (in vars or included via `-e` in the command line) similar to your Terraform variables like `vpc_cidr_block`, `security_group_name`, `ssh_cidr_blocks`, etc.

```yaml
---
- name: Provision AWS Infrastructure for Rails Application
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    region: us-west-2
    vpc_cidr_block: "10.0.0.0/16"
    public_subnet_cidr_block: "10.0.10.0/24"
    availability_zone: "us-west-2a"
    ssh_cidr_blocks: ["0.0.0.0/0"] # Example, replace with your value
    http_cidr_blocks: ["0.0.0.0/0"] # Example, replace with your value
    https_cidr_blocks: ["0.0.0.0/0"] # Example, replace with your value
    postgres_cidr_blocks: ["10.0.0.0/16"] # Example, replace within VPC range
    redis_cidr_blocks: ["10.0.0.0/16"] # Example, replace within VPC range
    security_group_name: "rails-sg"
    # Add more variables as required

  # Add more tasks for other resources like AWS instance following similar pattern
```

This playbook is a starting point based on your Terraform configuration. Due to differences in how Terraform and Ansible manage state and resources, there might be adjustments required to fit your exact needs. Make sure to review and adjust the playbook
