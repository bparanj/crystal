## Purpose of Subnet

The purpose of a subnet is to partition a network into smaller, manageable segments, improving network performance and security by limiting broadcast traffic and providing a way to organize resources efficiently.

Organizing resources efficiently means arranging network resources in a way that optimizes their use, accessibility, and management, leading to improved performance and easier administration.

## Design Decisions

Deciding on the number of subnets in an AWS VPC involves considering several factors:

1. **Purpose of Subnets**: Subnets can be public or private. Public subnets are used for resources that must be accessible from the internet, like web servers. Private subnets are for resources that shouldn't be directly accessed from the internet, like databases.

2. **Availability Zones (AZs)**: Distributing subnets across multiple AZs provides high availability and fault tolerance. Each subnet resides entirely within one AZ.

3. **Size of the VPC**: The CIDR block assigned to your VPC will determine the maximum IP address space available and, by extension, how many subnets you can create and their sizes.

4. **Service Separation**: You might separate services into different subnets for security, performance, or organizational reasons. For example, web servers, application servers, and database servers might each reside in their own subnets.

5. **Growth and Scalability**: Anticipate future growth. Creating more subnets than currently needed can provide flexibility for scaling your architecture.

6. **Compliance and Security Requirements**: Certain regulations or security best practices may necessitate separating resources into different subnets.

7. **Network ACLs and Security Groups**: Different subnets can have different network access control lists (NACLs) and security groups for tailored access and security settings.

### Key Takeaways:
- Use public subnets for internet-facing resources and private subnets for internal resources.
- Distribute subnets across multiple AZs for higher availability.
- Plan for current and future needs, considering scalability and organizational requirements.
- Separate resources based on function, compliance, and security needs.

By evaluating these considerations, you can determine an appropriate number of subnets for your VPC that balances flexibility, scalability, and security.

Yes, "public subnet" is an AWS terminology used in the context of Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

In AWS, a VPC is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It allows you to launch AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, in a logically isolated virtual network environment.

Within a VPC, you can create subnets, which are ranges of IP addresses. Subnets can be classified as either public or private:

1. Public Subnet:
   - A public subnet is a subnet that is associated with a route table that has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW).
   - Instances launched in a public subnet can have public IP addresses and can be directly accessible from the internet.
   - Public subnets are  used for resources that need to be publicly accessible, such as web servers or bastion hosts.

2. Private Subnet:
   - A private subnet is a subnet that does not have a direct route to an Internet Gateway.
   - Instances launched in a private subnet do not have public IP addresses and cannot be directly accessed from the internet.
   - Private subnets are  used for resources that do not need direct internet access, such as databases or application servers.

The concept of public and private subnets is specific to AWS and is used to control the accessibility and security of resources within a VPC. By strategically placing resources in public or private subnets, you can define the desired level of internet accessibility and isolate sensitive resources from direct public access.

Other cloud providers may have similar concepts but might use different terminologies. For example, in Microsoft Azure, the equivalent of a public subnet is called a "public IP address space," and in Google Cloud Platform, it is referred to as a "public subnet."
