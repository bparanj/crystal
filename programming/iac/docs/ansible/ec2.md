No, an EC2 instance can only reside in a single subnet at a time. Each EC2 instance is associated with a specific subnet within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) when it is launched.

However, you can achieve similar functionality by using the following approaches:

1. Multiple Network Interfaces: You can attach multiple Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) to an EC2 instance, each associated with a different subnet. This allows the instance to have multiple private IP addresses, each connected to a different subnet within the same VPC. However, the instance itself still resides in a single subnet.

2. Dual-homed Instances: You can create a dual-homed instance by launching an EC2 instance in one subnet and then attaching a secondary ENI from another subnet to the instance. This allows the instance to communicate with resources in both subnets. However, the instance's primary network interface still determines the subnet in which the instance resides.

3. Load Balancer: If you need to distribute traffic across instances in multiple subnets, you can use a load balancer. The load balancer can be configured to route traffic to instances in different subnets within the same VPC. This allows you to achieve high availability and distribute traffic across multiple subnets.

4. VPC Peering: If you have resources in different VPCs and want to connect them, you can use VPC peering. VPC peering allows you to establish a network connection between two VPCs, enabling instances in different VPCs to communicate with each other as if they were in the same network.

While an EC2 instance itself cannot simultaneously reside in two subnets, these approaches provide ways to achieve connectivity and communication between instances and resources in different subnets or VPCs.

The one-to-one association between an EC2 instance and a subnet is a fundamental design principle in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and is based on several reasons:

1. IP Addressing: Each EC2 instance is assigned a private IP address from the CIDR block of the subnet it is launched in. The subnet's CIDR block determines the range of available IP addresses for instances within that subnet. If an instance could reside in multiple subnets simultaneously, it would lead to IP address conflicts and complexity in network configuration.

2. Network Configuration: Subnets are used to partition a VPC into smaller network segments, each with its own set of security and network configurations. These configurations include settings such as route tables, network ACLs, and security groups. Associating an instance with a single subnet ensures that the instance inherits the network configuration specific to that subnet, providing a clear and consistent network environment.

3. Security and Access Control: Security groups, which act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances, are applied at the instance level and are associated with specific subnets. If an instance could belong to multiple subnets, it would complicate the application and management of security group rules, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities and inconsistencies.

4. Routing and Network Traffic: Each subnet is associated with a route table that defines the traffic flow for instances within that subnet. If an instance could span multiple subnets, it would introduce complexity in routing and managing network traffic, as different subnets may have different routing configurations.

5. AWS Architecture and Boundaries: The one-to-one relationship between an instance and a subnet aligns with the overall architecture and boundaries within AWS. Subnets are designed to provide a logical boundary and isolation within a VPC, and allowing instances to reside in multiple subnets would blur those boundaries and introduce unnecessary complexity.

By enforcing a one-to-one association between an EC2 instance and a subnet, AWS maintains a clear and consistent network architecture, simplifies network configuration, ensures proper security controls, and aligns with the overall design principles of VPCs and subnets within the AWS ecosystem.

Yes, you can have an EC2 instance associated with a VPC that has both a public subnet and a private subnet. This is a common architecture used in AWS to provide different levels of network access and security for an instance.

Here's how you can set it up:

1. VPC: Create a VPC with a defined CIDR block that encompasses the IP address range for your network.

2. Subnets:
   - Create a public subnet within the VPC. This subnet will have a route table that directs internet-bound traffic to an Internet Gateway, allowing instances in this subnet to have direct access to the internet.
   - Create a private subnet within the same VPC. This subnet will not have a direct route to the internet. Instead, it may have a route to a NAT Gateway or a virtual private gateway for controlled outbound internet access or communication with other private networks.

3. EC2 Instance:
   - Launch an EC2 instance within the VPC.
   - During the instance launch process, select the private subnet for the instance's primary network interface.
   - You can also choose to assign a public IP address to the instance if you want it to be directly accessible from the internet. However, for security reasons, it's common to keep the instance in a private subnet and access it through other means like a bastion host or a load balancer.

4. Network Interfaces (optional):
   - If needed, you can attach an additional Elastic Network Interface (ENI) to the EC2 instance, associated with the public subnet.
   - This allows the instance to have a presence in both the private and public subnets, while still being primarily associated with the private subnet.

By configuring the EC2 instance in this manner, you can have it residing in a private subnet for security and isolation, while still having controlled access to the internet or other resources through the public subnet.

This architecture allows you to maintain a secure and controlled environment for your EC2 instance, where you can define access patterns, security group rules, and network configurations specific to each subnet based on your requirements.

Yes, you can have an EC2 instance that has Caddy installed in a public subnet and connects to a database server in a private subnet, all within the same VPC. This is a common architecture pattern known as a "three-tier architecture" or "multi-tier architecture."

Here's how you can set it up:

1. VPC: Create a VPC with a defined CIDR block that encompasses the IP address range for your network.

2. Subnets:
   - Create a public subnet within the VPC. This subnet will have a route table that directs internet-bound traffic to an Internet Gateway, allowing instances in this subnet to have direct access to the internet.
   - Create a private subnet within the same VPC. This subnet will not have a direct route to the internet. It will be used to host the database server.

3. EC2 Instance:
   - Launch an EC2 instance within the VPC.
   - During the instance launch process, select the public subnet for the instance's primary network interface.
   - Assign a public IP address to the instance so that it can be accessed from the internet.
   - Install and configure Caddy on this EC2 instance to serve as the web server.

4. Database Server:
   - Launch another EC2 instance within the VPC.
   - During the instance launch process, select the private subnet for the instance's primary network interface.
   - Install and configure your desired database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) on this EC2 instance.

5. Security Groups:
   - Configure a security group for the Caddy EC2 instance in the public subnet. Allow inbound traffic on the necessary ports (e.g., HTTP port 80, HTTPS port 443) from the internet.
   - Configure a security group for the database EC2 instance in the private subnet. Allow inbound traffic only from the security group associated with the Caddy EC2 instance.

6. Network Configuration:
   - Ensure that the private subnet has a route table that does not have a direct route to the internet. It should only have a local route within the VPC.
   - Configure the Caddy EC2 instance to communicate with the database EC2 instance using the private IP address of the database instance.

With this setup, the Caddy EC2 instance in the public subnet can serve web traffic from the internet, while securely connecting to the database EC2 instance in the private subnet using the private network within the VPC.

The private subnet provides an additional layer of security for the database server, as it is not directly accessible from the internet. The Caddy EC2 instance acts as a reverse proxy, handling incoming web requests and communicating with the database server on behalf of the clients.

Configure the security groups, network ACLs, and other security measures to ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed between the instances and subnets based on your specific requirements.

In the scenario I described, there will be two EC2 instances running:

1. Caddy EC2 Instance:
   - This instance is launched in the public subnet.
   - It has Caddy installed and configured to serve as the web server.
   - It is assigned a public IP address and is accessible from the internet.
   - The security group associated with this instance allows inbound traffic on the necessary ports (e.g., HTTP port 80, HTTPS port 443) from the internet.

2. Database EC2 Instance:
   - This instance is launched in the private subnet.
   - It has the database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) installed and configured.
   - It does not have a public IP address and is not directly accessible from the internet.
   - The security group associated with this instance allows inbound traffic only from the security group associated with the Caddy EC2 instance.

The two EC2 instances are separate and serve different purposes within the architecture:

- The Caddy EC2 instance handles the web-facing traffic, receives requests from clients over the internet, and acts as a reverse proxy to communicate with the database server.
- The Database EC2 instance hosts the database server and is responsible for storing and managing the application's data. It is isolated in the private subnet and is only accessible by the Caddy EC2 instance through the private network within the VPC.

Having separate instances for the web server and the database server provides a clear separation of concerns, improves security by isolating the database from direct internet access, and allows for independent scaling and management of each component.

The Caddy EC2 instance and the Database EC2 instance work together to form the three-tier architecture, with the Caddy instance serving as the presentation and application tier, and the Database instance serving as the data tier.

Yes, it is possible to have a single EC2 instance that has Caddy installed in a public subnet and connects to a database server in a private subnet within the same VPC. This architecture is known as a "two-tier architecture" or "client-server architecture."

Here's how you can set it up:

1. VPC: Create a VPC with a defined CIDR block that encompasses the IP address range for your network.

2. Subnets:
   - Create a public subnet within the VPC. This subnet will have a route table that directs internet-bound traffic to an Internet Gateway, allowing instances in this subnet to have direct access to the internet.
   - Create a private subnet within the same VPC. This subnet will not have a direct route to the internet. It will be used to host the database server.

3. EC2 Instance:
   - Launch a single EC2 instance within the VPC.
   - During the instance launch process, select the public subnet for the instance's primary network interface.
   - Assign a public IP address to the instance so that it can be accessed from the internet.
   - Install and configure Caddy on this EC2 instance to serve as the web server.

4. Database Server:
   - Within the same EC2 instance, install and configure your desired database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to run in the private subnet.
   - Configure the database server to listen on the private IP address of the EC2 instance.

5. Security Groups:
   - Configure a security group for the EC2 instance allowing inbound traffic on the necessary ports for Caddy (e.g., HTTP port 80, HTTPS port 443) from the internet.
   - Configure the same security group to allow inbound traffic on the database port (e.g., MySQL port 3306) only from the local IP address of the EC2 instance itself.

6. Network Configuration:
   - Ensure that the private subnet has a route table that does not have a direct route to the internet. It should only have a local route within the VPC.
   - Configure Caddy to communicate with the database server using the private IP address of the EC2 instance.

With this setup, the single EC2 instance acts as both the web server and the database server. Caddy, running in the public subnet, handles incoming web requests from the internet, while the database server runs in the private subnet and is accessed by Caddy using the private network within the EC2 instance.

The private subnet provides an additional layer of security for the database server, as it is not directly accessible from the internet. Caddy communicates with the database server using the private IP address, ensuring that the database traffic remains within the EC2 instance and is not exposed to the public network.

Configure the security groups and other security measures to ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed to the EC2 instance and between the subnets based on your specific requirements.

In that case, using a single EC2 instance for both the web application and the PostgreSQL database is a suitable approach, especially if you want to keep the architecture simple and avoid managing multiple instances.

Since you have already installed PostgreSQL using an Ansible playbook on the EC2 instance, you can proceed with the following steps to deploy your monolithic MVC web application:

1. EC2 Instance Configuration:
   - Ensure that your EC2 instance is launched in a public subnet of your VPC.
   - Assign a public IP address to the instance so that it can be accessed from the internet.
   - Configure the necessary security group rules to allow inbound traffic on the required ports for your web application (e.g., HTTP port 80, HTTPS port 443) from the internet.

2. Web Application Deployment:
   - Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH.
   - Install the necessary dependencies and runtime environment for your web application (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java).
   - Copy your web application files to the EC2 instance, or clone your application repository from a version control system (e.g., Git).
   - Configure your web application to connect to the PostgreSQL database using the private IP address of the EC2 instance and the appropriate database credentials.
   - Start your web application server and ensure it is running and accessible.

3. Database Configuration:
   - Since PostgreSQL is already installed on the EC2 instance, you don't need to make any changes to the database installation.
   - Ensure that the PostgreSQL configuration file (e.g., `postgresql.conf`) is set to listen on the private IP address of the EC2 instance.
   - Configure the PostgreSQL client authentication file (e.g., `pg_hba.conf`) to allow connections from the web application using the appropriate authentication method (e.g., password, trusted).
   - Create the necessary database and user for your web application.

4. Security Considerations:
   - Configure the security group associated with the EC2 instance to allow inbound traffic only on the necessary ports for your web application and SSH (port 22) for administrative access.
   - Ensure that the PostgreSQL port (default: 5432) is not open to the internet and is only accessible within the EC2 instance.
   - Regularly apply security updates and patches to your EC2 instance, web application, and PostgreSQL database.

By following this approach, you can deploy your monolithic MVC web application on a single EC2 instance, with the web application and PostgreSQL database running on the same instance. The web application will communicate with the database using the private IP address of the EC2 instance, keeping the database traffic within the instance and not exposing it to the public network.

Remember to properly secure your EC2 instance, configure appropriate access controls, and regularly monitor your application and database for any security vulnerabilities or performance issues.

If your application grows in complexity or requires better scalability in the future, you can always consider separating the web application and database into separate EC2 instances or explore managed database services like Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL.

In the scenario where you have a single EC2 instance running both the web application and the PostgreSQL database, you can simplify the network architecture by using only a public subnet. Here's why:

1. Public Subnet:
   - The EC2 instance will be launched in a public subnet, which means it will have a public IP address and can be directly accessed from the internet.
   - The public subnet will have an internet gateway attached to it, allowing the EC2 instance to communicate with the internet.
   - You will configure the necessary security group rules to allow inbound traffic on the required ports for your web application (e.g., HTTP port 80, HTTPS port 443) from the internet.

2. No Need for a Private Subnet:
   - Since both the web application and the PostgreSQL database are running on the same EC2 instance, there is no need for a separate private subnet.
   - The communication between the web application and the database will occur within the EC2 instance itself, using the private IP address or localhost.
   - By keeping the database within the same instance and not exposing it to the internet, you maintain a level of security and isolation.

3. Simplified Network Configuration:
   - With only a public subnet, you don't need to configure additional routing tables, NAT gateways, or VPC peering connections.
   - The EC2 instance will have direct internet access through the internet gateway attached to the public subnet.

However, it's important to note that while using a single public subnet simplifies the architecture, it does come with some considerations:

1. Security:
   - Since the EC2 instance is in a public subnet and has a public IP address, it is directly exposed to the internet.
   - You must ensure that you have strong security measures in place, such as properly configured security groups, regular software updates, and secure access controls.
   - You should also consider implementing additional security practices like SSL/TLS encryption for transmitting sensitive data and enabling firewall rules on the EC2 instance itself.

2. Scalability and High Availability:
   - With a single EC2 instance running both the web application and database, you may face limitations in terms of scalability and high availability.
   - If the instance experiences high traffic or requires maintenance, it could impact both the web application and the database simultaneously.
   - In scenarios where you need to scale or ensure high availability, you may need to consider separating the web application and database into separate instances or utilize managed services like Amazon RDS.

In summary, for a simple monolithic MVC web application with a PostgreSQL database running on a single EC2 instance, using only a public subnet can be sufficient. However, you should carefully consider the security implications and potential limitations in terms of scalability and high availability.

If your application requires higher levels of security, scalability, or fault tolerance, you may need to explore more advanced architectures, such as using separate instances for the web application and database, implementing a load balancer, or leveraging managed services like Amazon RDS for the database.



Here's a basic example of an Ansible playbook that uses the `amazon.aws.ec2_instance` module to launch new EC2 instances in AWS. Before running this playbook, ensure you have the required AWS credentials set up in your environment or in your Ansible configuration, and the `amazon.aws` collection installed.

```yaml
---
- name: Launch EC2 Instances
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Launch a new EC2 instance
      amazon.aws.ec2_instance:
        name: "MyEC2Instance"
        key_name: "my-keypair"
        image_id: "ami-1234567890abcdef0" # Use the appropriate AMI for your region and OS
        instance_type: "t2.micro"
        network:
          subnet_id: "subnet-12345678" # Your subnet ID
          assign_public_ip: true
        wait: true
        state: present
        tags:
          Name: "MyEC2Instance"
      register: ec2

    - name: Print the instance ID and IP
      debug:
        msg: "Instance ID is {{ ec2.instance.id }} and public IP is {{ ec2.instance.public_ip_address }}"
```

### Key Points:
- **`name`**: A unique name for the EC2 instance.
- **`key_name`**: The name of the key pair to use. Ensure this key pair exists in your AWS account.
- **`image_id`**: The AMI ID of the image you want to use. This varies by region and your requirements.
- **`instance_type`**: The type of instance (e.g., t2.micro). This determines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance.
- **`network`**: Network configuration,  the subnet ID. Optionally, `assign_public_ip` can be set to `true` to assign a public IP address.
- **`wait`**: If set to `true`, Ansible waits until the instance is in the running state.
- **`state`**: `present` to create the instance, `absent` to terminate it.
- **`tags`**: Optional tags to assign to the instance for identification and management purposes.

Before executing this playbook, replace placeholder values (e.g., `"ami-1234567890abcdef0"`, `"subnet-12345678"`, `"my-keypair"`) with  values from your AWS account. Ensure the `amazon.aws` collection is installed by running `ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws`, and configure your AWS access credentials (e.g., via environment variables, `~/.aws/credentials`, or Ansible vault).

No, you cannot directly use a local PEM file by replacing the `key_name` in the playbook with the PEM file's name. The `key_name` parameter requires the name of an SSH key pair that is already registered with your AWS account. To use your local PEM file, you first need to import it into AWS EC2 as a key pair and then use the name you assigned it during the import in your playbook.

# Create AWS EC2 using Ansible Galaxy

## Environment Setup

Before running the `create_ec2.yml` Ansible playbook to create an EC2 instance, you should complete several preparatory tasks to ensure everything works smoothly. Here’s a list of things to do:

1. **Install Ansible**:
   - Ensure Ansible is installed on your machine. If not, install it using your system's package manager or Python's pip. For example, using pip:
     ```shell
     pip install ansible
     ```

2. **Install Python**:
   - Ansible requires Python. Make sure Python is installed on your system.

3. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   - Obtain your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key by creating an IAM user in your AWS account with programmatic access and sufficient permissions to manage EC2 instances.
   - Set these credentials as environment variables for security:
     ```shell
     export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
     export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
     ```

4. **Configure SSH Key Pair for EC2**:
   - If you don’t already have an SSH key pair, generate one in the AWS EC2 console. This key pair will be used to securely connect to your EC2 instance after it's launched.
   - Make sure the private key file is securely stored on your system and its permissions are set to be accessible only by you (e.g., `chmod 400 mykey.pem`).

5. **Choose an AMI and Instance Type**:
   - Decide on the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID that your EC2 instance will use. The AMI determines the OS and software that will be pre-installed on your instance.
   - Choose an instance type (e.g., `t2.micro`). This determines the hardware specifications of your instance.

6. **Define Security Group and Subnet**:
   - Identify the security group to assign to your EC2 instance. The security group acts as a virtual firewall controlling the traffic to and from the instance.
   - If you're using VPC, determine which subnet to launch your instance into.

7. **Ansible Galaxy Collection**:
   - Install the required Ansible Galaxy collection (`amazon.aws`) if you haven't done so already:
     ```shell
     ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws
     ```

8. **Review and Update the Playbook**:
   - Make sure your playbook (`create_ec2.yml`) is updated with the correct key pair name, security group, subnet ID, AMI ID, and any other parameters specific to your setup.

9. **Testing Connectivity**:
   - Ensure you have internet connectivity and the ability to reach AWS endpoints from the machine where you're running Ansible.

10. **Ansible Inventory File**:
    - Although in this case, you're likely running the playbook on localhost, ensure your Ansible inventory file is correctly set up if you plan to manage remote hosts.

By completing these tasks, you ensure that the necessary prerequisites are met for a successful execution of your Ansible playbook to create an EC2 instance on AWS.

## Create EC2 Instance Using Ansible

To use Ansible for creating an Amazon EC2 instance, first, you need to install the `amazon.aws` collection from Ansible Galaxy. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

1. **Install the `amazon.aws` Collection**:
   
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install the `amazon.aws` collection. This collection includes modules and plugins required to interact with AWS services,  EC2.

   ```shell
   ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws
   ```

2. **Set Up Your AWS Access Credentials**:

   Before you proceed, ensure you have your AWS access key and secret key available. You can set these up as environment variables for better security and convenience.

   ```shell
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
   ```

3. **Create a Playbook for EC2 Instance**:

   A playbook in Ansible defines the tasks you want to automate. Here’s a simple example of a playbook (`create_ec2.yml`) that creates an EC2 instance:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Create an EC2 instance
     hosts: localhost
     gather_facts: no
     collections:
       - amazon.aws
     tasks:
     - name: Launch an instance
       ec2:
         key_name: your_keypair_name
         instance_type: t2.micro
         image: ami-12345678
         wait: yes
         region: us-east-1
         group: your_security_group
         vpc_subnet_id: your_subnet_id
         assign_public_ip: yes
       register: ec2
   ```

   Replace `your_keypair_name`, `ami-12345678`, `your_security_group`, and `your_subnet_id` with your  AWS key pair name, AMI ID, security group ID, and subnet ID, respectively.

4. **Run the Playbook**:

   Execute your playbook with the following command. This will start the process of creating an EC2 instance based on the configurations you’ve provided.

   ```shell
   ansible-playbook create_ec2.yml
   ```

**Key Takeaways**:

- The `amazon.aws` collection from Ansible Galaxy provides the necessary modules to interact with AWS services.
- Always handle your AWS credentials securely. Using environment variables is one recommended way.
- An Ansible playbook allows you to define and automate tasks, such as creating an EC2 instance.
- Modify the playbook parameters according to your requirements, like instance type, region, and AMI ID.

## Creating Security Group and Subnet

To address item #6, which involves defining a security group and subnet for your EC2 instance, we'll create a simplified Ansible playbook. This playbook will include tasks to create a new security group (if one doesn't already exist) and specify the subnet ID for launching the EC2 instance. We'll assume you already have a VPC where you want to create your security group and instance.

### Ansible Playbook: Setup EC2 with Security Group and Subnet

Below is a sample playbook called `setup_ec2_with_sg_and_subnet.yml`. This playbook demonstrates how to create a security group, allowing SSH access, and then launch an EC2 instance within a specified subnet and security group.

```yaml
---
- name: Setup EC2 instance with a Security Group and Subnet
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  collections:
    - amazon.aws

  vars:
    region: us-east-1
    vpc_id: vpc-xxxxxxx
    subnet_id: subnet-yyyyyyy
    security_group_name: MyAnsibleSG
    security_group_description: Security Group created by Ansible
    instance_type: t2.micro
    ami_id: ami-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    key_name: your_keypair_name

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Security Group exists
      ec2_group:
        name: "{{ security_group_name }}"
        description: "{{ security_group_description }}"
        region: "{{ region }}"
        vpc_id: "{{ vpc_id }}"
        rules:
          - proto: tcp
            ports:
              - 22
            cidr_ip: 0.0.0.0/0
      register: sg

    - name: Launch an EC2 instance
      ec2:
        key_name: "{{ key_name }}"
        instance_type: "{{ instance_type }}"
        image: "{{ ami_id }}"
        wait: yes
        region: "{{ region }}"
        group_id: "{{ sg.group_id }}"
        vpc_subnet_id: "{{ subnet_id }}"
        assign_public_ip: yes
      register: ec2
```

### Key Points to Customize in Your Playbook:
- `region`: AWS region where your resources will be created.
- `vpc_id`: ID of your VPC.
- `subnet_id`: ID of your subnet where the EC2 instance will be launched.
- `security_group_name`: The name for the security group.
- `instance_type`: The type of instance (e.g., `t2.micro`).
- `ami_id`: The AMI ID for the instance.
- `key_name`: Name of your SSH key pair.

This playbook starts by ensuring there's a security group with the specified name allowing SSH access. It then launches an EC2 instance within the defined subnet and security group. Customize the variables to match your AWS environment before running the playbook.

No, you don't necessarily have to create the VPC and subnet manually if you're willing to use Ansible for automation. Ansible allows you to automate the creation of VPCs and subnets using its modules, specifically designed for AWS resource management. Here's how you can extend the playbook to include tasks for creating a VPC and a subnet if they do not already exist:

### Extending the Playbook for VPC and Subnet Creation

- name: Setup VPC, Subnet, Security Group, and Launch EC2 Instance
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  collections:
    - amazon.aws

### Key Aspects to Note:

- **VPC and Subnet Creation**: This playbook begins by creating a VPC with the specified CIDR block. It then creates a subnet within this VPC. You can adjust the `vpc_cidr_block` and `subnet_cidr_block` to fit your network design.
- **Security Group**: After setting up the network infrastructure, the playbook creates a security group within the new VPC, allowing SSH access.
- **EC2 Instance Launch**: Finally, it launches an EC2 instance within the newly created subnet and security group.

### Customization:

- **Region, CIDR Blocks, and Availability Zone**: Customize the region, VPC and subnet CIDR blocks, and the availability zone according to your requirements.
- **AMI ID and Instance Type**: Specify the appropriate AMI ID and instance type.
- **Key Pair**: Ensure you have an SSH key pair created in the specified AWS region and provide its name in the playbook.

Using this approach, you can fully automate your AWS environment setup,  network and instance creation, with Ansible. This is useful for creating reproducible environments or for managing infrastructure as code.

## Creating the AWS Resources

For creating AWS resources like a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnets, you have two main options: manual creation through the AWS Management Console or automated creation using tools like Ansible or AWS CloudFormation. Automating with Ansible can be very efficient and repeatable, especially for software engineers looking to manage infrastructure as code.

If you prefer to automate the creation of a VPC and subnets, you would use Ansible modules like `ec2_vpc_net` and `ec2_vpc_subnet`. However, if you're setting up a simple environment or doing it for the first time, creating them manually via the AWS Console might be a straightforward approach to understand the concepts.

Regarding the AMI ID `ami-12345678`, this is a placeholder value. AMI IDs are region-specific and change over time as new images are released. To find the AMI ID for Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) for your specific region:

1. Go to the EC2 Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to "Instances" > "Launch Instance".
3. In the "AMI" section, search for "Ubuntu" and filter by your desired version, like "22.04".
4. Ensure you select an AMI based on your region and requirements (e.g., HVM, EBS-optimized instances).

For automation or script use, you can also use the AWS CLI to query for the latest Ubuntu 22.04 AMI ID:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-images --filters "Name=name,Values=ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*" "Name=state,Values=available" --query 'Images[*].[ImageId,CreationDate]' --output text --region your-region | sort -k2 -r | head -n1
```

Replace `your-region` with your  AWS region. This command filters available images for Ubuntu 22.04, sorts them by the creation date to get the latest one, and outputs the most recent AMI ID.

For tasks like creating a VPC, subnets, or finding the correct AMI ID, automating these can save time and reduce the potential for human error, making it a good practice for software engineers interested in infrastructure automation and cloud computing.

This playbook performs the following tasks:

1. Retrieves the latest AMI based on the specified filters.
2. Creates an Elastic IP.
3. Generates an RSA private key.
4. Creates a random suffix for the secret name.
5. Creates a Secrets Manager secret.
6. Stores the private key in the Secrets Manager secret.
7. Creates a key pair using the public key.
8. Creates a VPC.
9. Creates a public subnet within the VPC.
10. Creates an internet gateway and attaches it to the VPC.
11. Creates a public route table and associates it with the public subnet.
12. Creates a security group with the specified inbound and outbound rules.
13. Launches an EC2 instance for the Rails application using the latest AMI, subnet, security group, and key pair.
14. Associates the Elastic IP with the Rails EC2 instance.

Replace the placeholders (e.g., `{{ ssh_cidr_blocks }}`, `{{ http_cidr_blocks }}`, etc.) with the appropriate values based on your requirements.

Also, ensure that you have the necessary Ansible modules installed (`community.crypto`, `amazon.aws`) and the AWS credentials properly configured for authentication.
