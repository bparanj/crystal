To ensure that your playbook waits until the EC2 instance is fully booted and the SSH server is ready to accept connections, you can use the `amazon.aws.ec2` module to launch the instance and the `ansible.builtin.wait_for` module to wait for the SSH port to become available. Here's how you can structure such a playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Launch EC2 Instance and Wait for SSH
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    instance_type: t2.micro
    image_id: ami-123456 # Replace with the  AMI ID for your region
    region: us-east-1
    key_name: my-keypair # Replace with your key pair name
    security_group: my-security-group # Replace with your security group name
    subnet_id: subnet-123456 # Replace with your subnet ID

  tasks:
    - name: Launch a new EC2 instance
      amazon.aws.ec2:
        key_name: "{{ key_name }}"
        image: "{{ image_id }}"
        instance_type: "{{ instance_type }}"
        security_group: "{{ security_group }}"
        assign_public_ip: true
        wait: true
        region: "{{ region }}"
        count: 1
        vpc_subnet_id: "{{ subnet_id }}"
        tags:
          Name: "MyEC2Instance"
      register: ec2

    - name: Wait for SSH to become available
      ansible.builtin.wait_for:
        host: "{{ item.public_ip }}"
        port: 22
        state: started
        timeout: 300 # Wait for up to 5 minutes
      with_items: "{{ ec2.instances }}"
```

### Key Points:

- **Launch a new EC2 instance**: This task uses the `amazon.aws.ec2` module to create the instance. Adjust the variables like `image_id`, `instance_type`, `key_name`, `security_group`, and `subnet_id` to fit your AWS setup.
- **Wait for SSH to become available**: After launching the instance, the `ansible.builtin.wait_for` module waits for the SSH port (22) to be open on the instance's public IP address. The `timeout` parameter specifies how long to wait (in seconds) before giving up. The `with_items` loop iterates over the launched instances, making this playbook suitable even if you're launching multiple instances at once.

The `amazon.aws.ec2` module has been used here for launching the instance based on your request. However, if you're using the newer `amazon.aws.ec2_instance` module or another method to start an instance that is already existing but stopped, you might need to adjust the launch task accordingly. Also, ensure your environment is properly set up with AWS credentials and the `amazon.aws` Ansible collection is installed.
