Yes, Ansible can use a PEM file to connect to an EC2 instance. If you are able to connect to the EC2 instance manually using the PEM file, you can configure Ansible to use the same PEM file for establishing the SSH connection.

To use a PEM file with Ansible, you need to specify the path to the PEM file in your Ansible inventory or playbook. Here's how you can do it:

1. Create an Ansible inventory file (e.g., `inventory.ini`) and add your EC2 instance details:

```
[ec2_instances]
your_ec2_instance_hostname_or_ip ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/your/pemfile.pem
```

Replace `your_ec2_instance_hostname_or_ip` with the hostname or IP address of your EC2 instance, and `/path/to/your/pemfile.pem` with the  path to your PEM file.

2. In your Ansible playbook (e.g., `playbook.yml`), you can refer to the EC2 instance using the hostname or group defined in the inventory file:

```yaml
- hosts: ec2_instances
  tasks:
    - name: Execute a command on the EC2 instance
      command: ls -l /
```

3. Run the Ansible playbook using the following command:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
```

Ansible will use the PEM file specified in the inventory file to establish the SSH connection to the EC2 instance and execute the tasks defined in the playbook.

Make sure that the PEM file has the appropriate permissions (e.g., chmod 400 pemfile.pem) and that the Ansible control node has the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., ansible, boto3) to connect to the EC2 instance.

By configuring Ansible to use the PEM file, you can automate tasks and manage your EC2 instances using Ansible playbooks.

If the username on your EC2 instance is "ubuntu" instead of the default "ec2-user", you need to modify the Ansible inventory file accordingly. Here's how you can update the commands:

1. Update the Ansible inventory file (`inventory.ini`):

```
[ec2_instances]
your_ec2_instance_hostname_or_ip ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/your/pemfile.pem
```

Replace `your_ec2_instance_hostname_or_ip` with the hostname or IP address of your EC2 instance, and `/path/to/your/pemfile.pem` with the  path to your PEM file.

2. Your Ansible playbook (`playbook.yml`) remains the same:

```yaml
- hosts: ec2_instances
  tasks:
    - name: Execute a command on the EC2 instance
      command: ls -l /
```

3. Run the Ansible playbook using the following command:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
```

Ansible will use the "ubuntu" username specified in the inventory file along with the provided PEM file to establish the SSH connection to the EC2 instance and execute the tasks defined in the playbook.

Make sure that the "ubuntu" user has the necessary permissions to execute the tasks you have defined in your playbook.

By modifying the `ansible_user` parameter in the inventory file to match the  username on your EC2 instance, Ansible will use the correct user for establishing the SSH connection.

Yes, the instructions will still work when running the Ansible playbook from your laptop with the username "bparanj". The `ansible_user` parameter in the inventory file specifies the username to be used on the remote EC2 instance, not the local username on your laptop.

Here's how your setup should look:

1. Ansible inventory file (`inventory.ini`):

```
[ec2_instances]
your_ec2_instance_hostname_or_ip ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/your/pemfile.pem
```

Replace `your_ec2_instance_hostname_or_ip` with the hostname or IP address of your EC2 instance, and `/path/to/your/pemfile.pem` with the  path to your PEM file on your laptop.

2. Ansible playbook (`playbook.yml`):

```yaml
- hosts: ec2_instances
  tasks:
    - name: Execute a command on the EC2 instance
      command: ls -l /
```

3. Run the Ansible playbook from your laptop using the following command:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
```

Ansible will use the "ubuntu" username specified in the inventory file to establish the SSH connection to the EC2 instance, regardless of the local username on your laptop.

Make sure that:
- You have Ansible installed on your laptop.
- The PEM file specified in the inventory file exists on your laptop and has the correct permissions (e.g., chmod 400 pemfile.pem).
- Your laptop has network connectivity to the EC2 instance.

As long as you have configured the inventory file correctly with the appropriate EC2 instance details and PEM file path, and you have the necessary prerequisites set up on your laptop, running the Ansible playbook from your laptop with the username "bparanj" will work as expected.
