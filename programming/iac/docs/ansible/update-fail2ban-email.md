Given that there are two phases — the image build phase and the provisioning phase — and that the email for Fail2Ban notifications is provided during the provisioning phase, you can approach this by creating a separate Ansible playbook for the latter phase. This playbook should focus solely on updating the email in the Fail2Ban configuration file.

### Provisioning Playbook

Here's a playbook called `update_fail2ban_email.yml` that you can use during the provisioning phase:

```yaml
---
- name: Update Fail2Ban Notification Email
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    destemail: "your-email@your-domain.com"

  tasks:
    - name: Update the email address for sending ban notifications
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
        regexp: '^destemail ='
        line: "destemail = {{ destemail }}"
        state: present
```

### Playbook Breakdown

1. **Hosts**: Specifies the hosts where the playbook should run.
2. **Become**: Indicates that the tasks should run with escalated privileges, which is  necessary for modifying system configurations like Fail2Ban.
3. **Vars**: Sets the `destemail` variable to a default value. The  email address can be passed as a command-line argument when running the playbook.
4. **Tasks**:
   - **lineinfile**: Uses the `lineinfile` module to search for and update the `destemail` line in the `jail.local` configuration file.
   - **path**: Specifies the path to the Fail2Ban configuration file.
   - **regexp**: Matches any line starting with `destemail =`.
   - **line**: Sets the line to the new value based on the `destemail` variable.
   - **state**: Ensures the line is present in the file.

### Running the Playbook

To run the playbook and specify the email as a command-line argument, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook update_fail2ban_email.yml -e "destemail=customer-email@domain.com"
```

Replace `customer-email@domain.com` with the  email address to use for notifications.

### Conclusion

By separating the image build phase and the provisioning phase, you ensure that the Fail2Ban email address can be updated when it's ly known. This approach keeps your image build clean and adaptable, while the provisioning playbook allows you to customize the configuration for each customer.
