Yes, it is possible to use Ansible with AWS CDK. While AWS CDK is primarily used for defining and provisioning cloud infrastructure, you can integrate Ansible with CDK to perform configuration management and application deployment tasks on the provisioned resources.

Here are a few approaches to using Ansible with AWS CDK:

1. Ansible within CDK:
   - You can use AWS CDK to define and provision the infrastructure, such as EC2 instances, VPCs, and security groups.
   - Within your CDK code, you can include Ansible playbooks or roles as part of the provisioning process.
   - For example, you can use the `aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2` module to create EC2 instances and then use the `UserData` property to execute Ansible playbooks during instance launch.
   - This approach allows you to combine infrastructure provisioning and configuration management within the same CDK stack.

2. Ansible post-provisioning:
   - You can use AWS CDK to define and provision the infrastructure, and then use Ansible separately to configure and manage the provisioned resources.
   - After the CDK stack is deployed, you can use Ansible playbooks or roles to configure the EC2 instances, install software, deploy applications, and perform other management tasks.
   - This approach separates the infrastructure provisioning (CDK) and configuration management (Ansible) into separate steps.

3. Ansible with CDK outputs:
   - You can use AWS CDK to define and provision the infrastructure, and then use CDK outputs to pass information to Ansible.
   - CDK outputs allow you to export values from your CDK stack, such as instance IDs, IP addresses, or DNS names.
   - You can then use these outputs as variables in your Ansible playbooks or inventory files to target the provisioned resources.
   - This approach enables seamless integration between CDK and Ansible, allowing you to use CDK-provisioned resources as targets for Ansible management.

Here's a simplified example of using Ansible within AWS CDK (approach 1):

```typescript
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk/aws-ec2';

class MyStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Create an EC2 instance
    const instance = new ec2.Instance(this, 'MyInstance', {
      instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.T2, ec2.InstanceSize.MICRO),
      machineImage: ec2.MachineImage.latestAmazonLinux(),
      userData: ec2.UserData.custom(`
        #!/bin/bash
        yum install -y ansible
        ansible-playbook /path/to/playbook.yml
      `),
    });
  }
}
```

In this example, the CDK code creates an EC2 instance and uses the `UserData` property to install Ansible and execute an Ansible playbook during instance launch.

Remember to adjust the example based on your specific requirements, such as the desired EC2 instance configuration, Ansible playbook location, and any additional CDK resources you need.

Using Ansible with AWS CDK allows you to leverage the power of infrastructure as code (CDK) for provisioning while utilizing Ansible's configuration management capabilities to streamline the setup and management of your provisioned resources.

Yes, you can create a custom AMI (Amazon Machine Image) from an EC2 instance provisioned using AWS CDK and make it public. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Use AWS CDK to provision an EC2 instance:
   - Define your CDK stack and use the `aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2` module to create an EC2 instance.
   - Configure the instance with the desired settings, such as instance type, security group, and user data.
   - Deploy the CDK stack to create the EC2 instance.

2. Configure and customize the EC2 instance:
   - Connect to the provisioned EC2 instance using SSH or SSM (Systems Manager) Session Manager.
   - Perform any necessary configurations, install software, and make desired changes to the instance.
   - Ensure that the instance is in a stable and consistent state.

3. Create a custom AMI from the EC2 instance:
   - In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EC2 service.
   - Select the EC2 instance that you want to create an AMI from.
   - Choose "Actions" > "Image and templates" > "Create image".
   - Provide a name and description for the AMI.
   - Configure any additional settings, such as instance shutdown behavior and AMI tags.
   - Click "Create image" to initiate the AMI creation process.

4. Wait for the AMI creation to complete:
   - The AMI creation process may take some time, depending on the size of the instance and the amount of data to be captured.
   - You can monitor the progress of the AMI creation in the EC2 Management Console under "AMIs".

5. Make the AMI public:
   - Once the AMI creation is complete, select the newly created AMI in the EC2 Management Console.
   - Choose "Actions" > "Modify image permissions".
   - In the "Image permissions" dialog, select "Public" to make the AMI accessible to everyone.
   - Confirm the permission change.

6. Share the AMI ID:
   - After making the AMI public, note down the AMI ID.
   - You can share this AMI ID with others who want to use your custom AMI.

Here's a simplified example of creating an EC2 instance using AWS CDK and then creating a custom AMI:

```typescript
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk/aws-ec2';

class MyStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Create an EC2 instance
    const instance = new ec2.Instance(this, 'MyInstance', {
      instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.T2, ec2.InstanceSize.MICRO),
      machineImage: ec2.MachineImage.latestAmazonLinux(),
      // ... other instance configurations
    });
  }
}
```

After deploying the CDK stack and customizing the EC2 instance, you can follow the steps mentioned above to create a custom AMI and make it public.

Remember to consider the security implications of making an AMI public, as it allows anyone to launch instances using your AMI. Ensure that you have properly secured and hardened the instance before creating the AMI and making it public.

Also, keep in mind that creating and sharing AMIs may incur additional costs, such as storage costs for the AMI and data transfer costs when others launch instances using your AMI.
