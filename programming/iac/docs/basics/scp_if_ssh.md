The `scp_if_ssh` setting in the `ansible.cfg` configuration file determines the file transfer mechanism Ansible uses when copying files to remote hosts.

When `scp_if_ssh` is set to `False`, Ansible will use SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) for file transfers instead of SCP (Secure Copy Protocol), even when the `ssh` connection plugin is used.

Here's what you need to know about the `scp_if_ssh` setting:

1. Default Value:
   - By default, `scp_if_ssh` is set to `smart` in Ansible.
   - When set to `smart`, Ansible will use SCP for file transfers if the `ssh` connection plugin is used, and SFTP otherwise.

2. SFTP vs. SCP:
   - SFTP and SCP are both secure file transfer protocols that run over SSH.
   - SFTP is more feature-rich and supports a wider range of file operations compared to SCP.
   - SFTP is considered more reliable and efficient for file transfers, especially when dealing with large files or a high number of files.

3. Compatibility:
   - Some older SSH servers or clients may not support SFTP, in which case SCP is used as a fallback.
   - When `scp_if_ssh` is set to `False`, Ansible will always use SFTP, regardless of the SSH server or client's capabilities.

4. Performance:
   - SFTP generally offers better performance compared to SCP, particularly for transferring a large number of files or directories.
   - By setting `scp_if_ssh` to `False`, you can force Ansible to use SFTP for all file transfers, potentially improving the performance of your playbook execution.

5. Configuration:
   - To set `scp_if_ssh` to `False`, add the following line under the `[ssh_connection]` section in your `ansible.cfg` file:
     ```
     [ssh_connection]
     scp_if_ssh = False
     ```

   - Alternatively, you can set the `ANSIBLE_SCP_IF_SSH` environment variable to `False` to override the default behavior.

 setting `scp_if_ssh` to `False` assumes that SFTP is supported and available on all the remote hosts you are managing with Ansible. If SFTP is not available or if there are compatibility issues, you may encounter file transfer failures.

If you are unsure about the compatibility or if you want Ansible to automatically choose between SCP and SFTP based on the available capabilities, you can leave `scp_if_ssh` set to its default value of `smart`.

In most cases, leaving `scp_if_ssh` as `smart` or setting it to `False` should work well for file transfers in Ansible. The choice depends on your specific requirements, the SSH servers and clients in your environment, and any performance considerations you may have.
