The open-core model in open source projects involves having a core part of the software available under an open source license, while additional features or services are offered under a proprietary license. This model allows developers to provide the open source community with free access to the foundational elements of their software, while also generating revenue by selling advanced features, professional services, or enhancements that are not included in the free version. This approach helps balance community collaboration with commercial interests.

The open core model is a business and licensing strategy used by some open source projects. In this model, the core or base version of the software is released under an open source license, while additional features, extensions, or services are offered under a proprietary or commercial license.

Here are the key aspects of the open core model:

1. Open source core: The fundamental components and functionalities of the software are available under an open source license, such as GPL, MIT, or Apache. This allows users to access, modify, and distribute the core software freely.

2. Proprietary extensions: The project maintainers or the company behind the project develop additional features, modules, or plugins that are not part of the open source core. These extensions are typically licensed under a proprietary or commercial license and may require payment or subscription to access.

3. Revenue generation: The proprietary extensions serve as a means for the project or company to generate revenue. Users who require advanced functionalities, enterprise-level support, or specific integrations may need to purchase or subscribe to the commercial version of the software.

4. Community-driven development: The open source core benefits from community contributions, bug fixes, and improvements. The community can participate in the development process, report issues, and suggest enhancements for the core software.

5. Dual licensing: Some open core projects offer the option for users to choose between the open source version and a commercial version. The commercial version may include additional features, support, or more permissive licensing terms.

The open core model aims to strike a balance between the benefits of open source software, such as transparency, collaboration, and community involvement, and the financial sustainability of the project or company. It allows the project to generate revenue through proprietary extensions while still providing a free and open source core for users who don't require the additional features.

Examples of projects that follow the open core model include GitLab, MySQL (with the Enterprise edition), and Elasticsearch (with the X-Pack extensions).

 the open core model is different from a fully proprietary or closed-source model, as the core software remains open source and freely available.
