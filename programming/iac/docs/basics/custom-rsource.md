To use a custom resource to run the Ansible playbook as part of the AWS CDK deployment process, you can leverage AWS Lambda and the AWS CDK `custom_resources` module. Here's an example of how you can modify the previous code to include a custom resource for running the Ansible playbook:

```python
from aws_cdk import (
    aws_ec2 as ec2,
    aws_iam as iam,
    aws_lambda as lambda_,
    custom_resources as cr,
    App, Stack, Duration
)
from constructs import Construct

class PackerUbuntuStack(Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs)

        # ... (previous code for creating EC2 instance and custom AMI)

        # Create an IAM role for the Lambda function
        lambda_role = iam.Role(self, "LambdaRole",
            assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("lambda.amazonaws.com")
        )

        # Attach necessary permissions to the Lambda role
        lambda_role.add_managed_policy(
            iam.ManagedPolicy.from_aws_managed_policy_name("AmazonEC2FullAccess")
        )

        # Create a Lambda function to run the Ansible playbook
        ansible_lambda = lambda_.Function(self, "AnsibleLambda",
            code=lambda_.Code.from_asset("path/to/lambda/code"),
            handler="index.handler",
            runtime=lambda_.Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
            role=lambda_role,
            timeout=Duration.minutes(5)
        )

        # Create a custom resource to trigger the Lambda function
        ansible_resource = cr.AwsCustomResource(self, "AnsibleResource",
            policy=cr.AwsCustomResourcePolicy.from_sdk_calls(
                resources=cr.AwsCustomResourcePolicy.ANY_RESOURCE
            ),
            on_create=cr.AwsSdkCall(
                service="Lambda",
                action="invoke",
                parameters={
                    "FunctionName": ansible_lambda.function_name,
                    "Payload": "{\"playbook_file\": \"../ansible/playbooks/master_playbook.yml\", \"instance_id\": \"" + instance.instance_id + "\"}"
                },
                physical_resource_id=cr.PhysicalResourceId.of(instance.instance_id)
            )
        )

        # Add the custom resource as a dependency of the EC2 instance
        instance.node.add_dependency(ansible_resource)

# ... (rest of the code)
```

In this modified code:

1. The necessary AWS CDK modules are imported, including `aws_lambda` for Lambda functions and `custom_resources` for creating custom resources.

2. An IAM role is created for the Lambda function using `iam.Role`, and the necessary permissions are attached to the role (e.g., `AmazonEC2FullAccess`).

3. A Lambda function is created using `lambda_.Function` to run the Ansible playbook. You need to provide the path to the Lambda function code and specify the appropriate runtime and handler.

4. A custom resource is created using `cr.AwsCustomResource` to trigger the Lambda function. The `on_create` property is used to specify the SDK call to invoke the Lambda function, passing the necessary parameters such as the playbook file and instance ID.

5. The custom resource is added as a dependency of the EC2 instance using `instance.node.add_dependency(ansible_resource)` to ensure that the Ansible playbook is run after the instance is created.

Note that you need to provide the actual Lambda function code that runs the Ansible playbook. The Lambda function should have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., Ansible) and should execute the playbook using the provided playbook file and instance ID.

Also, make sure to grant the appropriate permissions to the Lambda function's IAM role to access the necessary AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances) and to execute the Ansible playbook.

By using a custom resource and Lambda function, you can trigger the execution of the Ansible playbook as part of the AWS CDK deployment process, allowing you to perform the necessary provisioning and configuration steps on the EC2 instance.
