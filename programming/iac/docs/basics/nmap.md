`nmap` (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool used for network discovery and security auditing. It can scan large networks or single hosts to discover available hosts, services, operating systems, firewalls, and other characteristics. Here's a basic guide on how to use `nmap`:

### 1. Installing Nmap

First, ensure `nmap` is installed on your system.

- **On Ubuntu/Debian:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install nmap
  ```
- **On CentOS/RHEL:**
  ```bash
  sudo yum install nmap
  ```
- **On Fedora:**
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install nmap
  ```
- **On macOS** (using Homebrew):
  ```bash
  brew install nmap
  ```

### 2. Basic Scanning

- **Scan a Single IP or Hostname:**
  ```bash
  nmap [target]
  ```
  Replace `[target]` with the IP address or hostname you wish to scan.

- **Scan Multiple IPs/Hosts:**
  ```bash
  nmap [target1] [target2] [target3]
  ```
  You can list several targets separated by spaces.

- **Scan a Range of IPs:**
  ```bash
  nmap [start_range]-[end_range]
  ```
  Example: `nmap 192.168.1.1-20` scans IPs from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.20.

- **Scan a Subnet:**
  ```bash
  nmap [subnet]
  ```
  Example: `nmap 192.168.1.0/24` scans the entire 192.168.1.x subnet.

### 3. Scan Types

- **Perform a Quick Scan:**
  ```bash
  nmap -T4 -F [target]
  ```
  The `-T4` flag speeds up the scan, and `-F` tells `nmap` to only scan the 100 most common ports.

- **Scan Specific Ports:**
  ```bash
  nmap -p [port(s)] [target]
  ```
  Example: `nmap -p 22,80,443 example.com` scans ports 22, 80, and 443 on `example.com`.

- **Scan All Ports:**
  ```bash
  nmap -p- [target]
  ```
  Scans all 65535 ports.

### 4. Detecting OS and Services

- **Enable OS and Version Detection:**
  ```bash
  nmap -A [target]
  ```
  The `-A` option enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

### 5. Output Formats

`nmap` can generate results in various formats:

- **Normal Output to a File:**
  ```bash
  nmap [target] -oN [outputfile.txt]
  ```
- **XML Output:**
  ```bash
  nmap [target] -oX [outputfile.xml]
  ```
- **Grepable Output:**
  ```bash
  nmap [target] -oG [outputfile.txt]
  ```

### Security Considerations

Using `nmap` can trigger alarms in security systems and may be considered hostile or illegal on networks you do not own or have permission to test. Always obtain explicit permission before scanning networks.

This overview covers the basics of using `nmap`. `nmap` has a wide range of options and capabilities, so consider referring to the official documentation or the `nmap` man page (`man nmap`) for more advanced features and techniques.

Goss is a quick and easy server validation tool, and `nmap` is a network scanning tool. They serve different purposes but can complement each other in a testing and validation workflow for an Ubuntu server. To use `nmap` with Goss to automatically generate tests for an Ubuntu server, you'd typically go through a process where `nmap` is used to gather information about the server, such as open ports and services, and then use that information to create Goss tests.

Here’s a basic outline of how you could integrate `nmap` with Goss for generating tests:

1. **Scan the Server with Nmap**: Use `nmap` to scan your Ubuntu server. This will help you identify which services are running and on what ports they're listening. For example:

    ```bash
    nmap -sV <server-ip>
    ```

    The `-sV` option enables version detection, allowing you to gather more information about the services running on each port.

2. **Analyze Nmap Output**: Review the `nmap` scan results to identify key services that you want to ensure are always running on your server. Make note of the service names and the ports they use.

3. **Write Goss Tests**: Based on the information from the `nmap` scan, create Goss tests for each service you want to check. Goss tests can verify that the correct ports are open and that expected services are listening on those ports. For example, if `nmap` shows an HTTP server running on port 80, you could write a Goss test like this:

    ```yaml
    port:
      tcp:80:
        listening: true
        ip: "0.0.0.0"
    ```

    This Goss test checks that port 80 is open and listening on all interfaces.

4. **Automate the Process**: While Goss doesn’t natively generate tests from `nmap` scan results, you can write a script to automate this process. The script would run `nmap`, parse the output to identify open ports and services, and then dynamically generate a Goss test file based on this information.

5. **Run Goss Tests**: With your Goss tests defined, use Goss to validate your server's configuration:

    ```bash
    goss -g <test-file>.yaml validate
    ```

To fully automate the generation of Goss tests based on `nmap` scans requires custom scripting because you need to parse `nmap` output and convert that into the Goss YAML test format. The automation script's complexity will depend on how detailed you want the generated tests to be and how many different services you need to check.

Goss has a feature called `autoadd` that simplifies the process of adding tests by automatically creating them for a specified service or file. However, integrating `nmap` directly with the `autoadd` command in Goss to scan network services and then automatically generate tests based on the scan results is not a built-in feature of Goss as of my last update. The `autoadd` command is primarily designed to work with local system resources like processes, services, packages, etc., and not directly with network scan outputs.

That said, to leverage both `nmap` for network scanning and Goss for validation in a cohesive workflow, you'd typically follow a two-step process where each tool is used for its strengths, but manually connect the dots:

1. **Use Nmap to Identify Services**: Run `nmap` to scan your server and identify running services and open ports. This step is manual and requires you to interpret the `nmap` output to decide what services you want to ensure are running and accessible.

2. **Manually Create Goss Tests Based on Nmap Findings**: For each service and port identified by `nmap`, manually use Goss `autoadd` to create tests for those services if they are recognized by Goss, or write custom Goss tests for the network services identified.

   For example, if `nmap` identifies that a web server is running on port 80, you could manually execute something like:

   ```bash
   goss add port 80
   ```

   This uses the `add` command rather than `autoadd` since `autoadd` is more suited for adding multiple tests for known services or packages by their names, rather than by network ports.

**Automating Integration Between Nmap and Goss:**
While Goss doesn't natively integrate with `nmap` output for automatic test generation, you can script a semi-automatic workflow. This would involve:
- Running an `nmap` scan and parsing its output to identify services and ports.
- Dynamically generating a script or set of commands that use `goss add` to create tests for these services and ports.

This approach requires custom scripting and a good understanding of both `nmap` output formats and Goss test syntax. The script would essentially map `nmap` findings to Goss commands, automating the test creation process based on network scan results. However, this approach is not straightforward and involves a significant amount of manual scripting and maintenance to ensure accuracy and relevance of tests.
