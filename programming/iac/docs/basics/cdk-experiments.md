Certainly! Here's a series of simple experiments that gradually build up to the equivalent AWS CDK code for the Packer and Terraform configurations:

Experiment 1: Basic Infrastructure Setup
1. Set up a new AWS CDK project using the AWS CDK CLI.
2. Create a new stack file (e.g., `infrastructure_stack.py`) in the CDK project.
3. In the stack file, define a VPC with a single public subnet.
4. Create an internet gateway and attach it to the VPC.
5. Create a route table for the public subnet and add a route to the internet gateway.
6. Deploy the stack and verify the creation of the VPC, subnet, internet gateway, and route table.

Experiment 2: EC2 Instance Creation
1. Extend the previous experiment by adding an EC2 instance to the stack.
2. Define an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) using the latest Amazon Linux 2 image.
3. Create an EC2 instance using the specified AMI and instance type.
4. Associate the EC2 instance with the public subnet created in Experiment 1.
5. Create a security group for the EC2 instance and add inbound rules for SSH access.
6. Deploy the stack and verify the creation of the EC2 instance.

Experiment 3: Custom AMI Creation
1. Extend Experiment 2 by creating a custom AMI using the EC2 instance.
2. Add a new resource to the stack for creating an EC2 Image.
3. Specify the EC2 instance as the source for the EC2 Image.
4. Configure the EC2 Image properties, such as name and description.
5. Deploy the stack and verify the creation of the custom AMI.

Experiment 4: Elastic IP and Association
1. Extend Experiment 3 by adding an Elastic IP and associating it with the EC2 instance.
2. Create an Elastic IP resource in the stack.
3. Create an Elastic IP association resource and specify the EC2 instance and Elastic IP.
4. Deploy the stack and verify the association of the Elastic IP with the EC2 instance.

Experiment 5: Key Pair and Secrets Manager
1. Extend Experiment 4 by generating a key pair and storing it in AWS Secrets Manager.
2. Generate an RSA key pair using the `tls_private_key` resource.
3. Create a Secrets Manager secret resource to store the private key.
4. Create a Secrets Manager secret version resource and specify the private key as the secret string.
5. Deploy the stack and verify the creation of the key pair and its storage in Secrets Manager.

Experiment 6: Integration with Ansible
1. Extend Experiment 5 by integrating Ansible for provisioning the EC2 instance.
2. Create a custom resource in the stack to trigger an AWS Lambda function.
3. Implement the Lambda function to execute an Ansible playbook for provisioning the EC2 instance.
4. Pass the necessary parameters, such as the playbook file path and EC2 instance ID, to the Lambda function.
5. Deploy the stack and verify the execution of the Ansible playbook on the EC2 instance.

Experiment 7: Complete Integration
1. Combine all the previous experiments into a single stack.
2. Refactor the code to use variables and parameterize the stack.
3. Implement any additional resources or configurations required for the Rails application.
4. Deploy the stack and verify the creation of the complete infrastructure setup.

By following these experiments, you can gradually build up the AWS CDK code to achieve the same functionality as the Packer and Terraform configurations. Each experiment focuses on a specific aspect of the infrastructure setup, allowing you to test and validate the individual components before combining them into the final solution.

Remember to regularly test and verify the deployed resources after each experiment to ensure they are working as expected. This iterative approach allows you to identify and resolve any issues early in the process.

Once you have completed all the experiments and have a working AWS CDK stack, you can compare it with the equivalent Packer and Terraform code to ensure that the desired infrastructure is being provisioned correctly.
