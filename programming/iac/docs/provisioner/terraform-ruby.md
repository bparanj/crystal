To run your Terraform script after updating the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) or any other part of your Terraform configuration, follow these steps:

1. **Open your Terminal or Command Prompt**.

2. **Navigate to your Terraform project directory** where your `.tf` files are located.

   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/terraform/directory
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform** (if you haven't done so already or if you've added new providers or modules). This step prepares your working directory for other Terraform commands and ensures that all dependencies are met.

   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Create a Terraform execution plan**. This step allows you to see what Terraform will do before making any changes to your infrastructure. It's a good practice to review this plan to ensure that the changes match your expectations.

   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply the Terraform configuration**. This step will make the  changes to your infrastructure based on your `.tf` files. Terraform will prompt you to confirm that you want to apply the changes. You can automatically approve the changes by adding the `-auto-approve` flag, but it's generally safer to review the plan before applying.

   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```

   Optionally, to apply changes without manual approval:

   ```sh
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

Remember, these steps will create, modify, or destroy infrastructure according to the definitions in your Terraform configuration files. Always review the plan generated by `terraform plan` before proceeding with `terraform apply` to avoid unintended changes to your infrastructure.

If you're managing multiple environments or configurations, make sure you're working in the correct directory and using the appropriate workspace (if you're using Terraform workspaces) to apply your changes.
