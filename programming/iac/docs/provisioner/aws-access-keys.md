```hcl
variable "aws_access_key" {
  description = "AWS access key"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

variable "aws_secret_key" {
  description = "AWS secret key"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}
```

Given your definition of `aws_access_key` and `aws_secret_key` variables in `variables.tf` as sensitive strings, you can use these variables securely in your Terraform configuration. To provide values for these variables using `TF_VAR_` environment variables, follow the process below:

### Setting Environment Variables

Open your terminal and set the `TF_VAR_aws_access_key` and `TF_VAR_aws_secret_key` environment variables to the values of your AWS access key and secret key, respectively. Replace the placeholders with your  AWS credentials:

```bash
export TF_VAR_aws_access_key="your_aws_access_key_here"
export TF_VAR_aws_secret_key="your_aws_secret_key_here"
```

### Using Variables in Provider Configuration

In your Terraform configuration (e.g., `main.tf`), use these variables within the AWS provider block:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-west-2"  # Example region
  access_key = var.aws_access_key
  secret_key = var.aws_secret_key
}
```

This setup instructs Terraform to use the values of `aws_access_key` and `aws_secret_key` variables, which you've provided via environment variables, for authenticating with AWS.

### Running Terraform Commands

With the environment variables set and the Terraform configuration in place, you can proceed with Terraform commands such as `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`. Terraform will use the credentials specified in the environment variables for AWS authentication, without the need to hardcode sensitive information in your Terraform files.

### Notes on Security

- **Sensitive Variables**: Marking variables as `sensitive` prevents their values from being displayed in Terraform's CLI output, enhancing security.
  
- **IAM Best Practices**: Whenever possible, use IAM roles (especially for resources like EC2 instances) or named profiles for AWS CLI as a more secure alternative to managing access and secret keys directly.
  
- **Environment Variable Precautions**: Be aware that environment variables can be accessed by other processes running in the same environment. Ensure your working environment is secure.

By following these steps, you can securely provide AWS credentials to Terraform using environment variables, adhering to best practices for sensitive data management.
