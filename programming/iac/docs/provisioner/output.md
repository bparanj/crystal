Terraform provides a way to output values that can be used for further automation steps. You can use output values to organize data to be easily queried and shown back to the Terraform user or passed to external programs. To define an output value, you can use the `output` block in your Terraform configuration.

Here is a basic example of how to define output values in Terraform:

```hcl
output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.my_instance.public_ip
}
```

In the example above, after running `terraform apply`, Terraform will print the public IP of the `my_instance` instance. You can also query this output later using `terraform output instance_public_ip`.

To save the outputs to a file automatically, you can redirect the output of the `terraform output` command to a file. For example, in a UNIX-like shell:

```shell
terraform output > terraform_outputs.txt
```

This command will save all outputs to `terraform_outputs.txt`.

If you specifically want to capture the output during the `terraform apply` step and save it to a file, you can use shell redirection or tee command as well. For example:

```shell
terraform apply | tee apply_output.txt
```

This will save the whole output of `terraform apply` to `apply_output.txt`,  the values of any output variables you have defined in your configuration.

For JSON format, which might be easier to use in automated scripts, you can run:

```shell
terraform output -json > terraform_outputs.json
```

This command will save the outputs in a JSON format to `terraform_outputs.json`, making it easier to parse programmatically.

Remember that storing sensitive information in outputs can expose these values in your state file and when using these commands. Use the `sensitive = true` attribute within the `output` block to prevent Terraform from showing its value in the CLI output:

```hcl
output "secret_value" {
  value     = aws_secretsmanager_secret.example.secret_string
  sensitive = true
}
```

By managing output values properly, you can streamline your infrastructure management processes and integrate Terraform more effectively into your automation workflows.

## Typical Workflow

The `terraform output` command is  run after the `terraform apply` command. The `terraform apply` command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, and it updates the Terraform state file with the latest state of your infrastructure. Once `terraform apply` has completed successfully, you can use the `terraform output` command to retrieve the output values defined in your Terraform configuration.

The `terraform output` command queries the state file to retrieve the values of output variables. This means for the output command to return the most up-to-date information, it should be run after any changes have been applied to your infrastructure with `terraform apply`.

Here's the typical workflow:

1. Run `terraform apply` to apply your Terraform configuration. Confirm the action when prompted, or run `terraform apply -auto-approve` to apply changes without interactive approval.

   ```shell
   terraform apply
   ```

2. After `terraform apply` completes successfully, run `terraform output` to retrieve the outputs. If you want the outputs in a JSON format, you can use the `-json` flag.

   ```shell
   terraform output -json
   ```

3. Optionally, redirect the output to a file for later use or for integration with other tools.

   ```shell
   terraform output -json > terraform_outputs.json
   ```

The outputs are based on the current state as recorded in the state file. So, if any changes to your infrastructure occur outside of Terraform, they may not be reflected in the outputs until you run `terraform apply` again to update the state file.
