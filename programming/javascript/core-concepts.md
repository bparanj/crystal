Event modifiers are special suffixes added to event listeners in Vue (e.g. `@click.prevent`) to alter how events are handled. Common modifiers include:

- `.stop`: Stops the event’s propagation.
- `.prevent`: Prevents the browser’s default behavior.
- `.capture`: Uses capture mode when listening for the event.
- `.once`: Runs the event listener only once.
- `.passive`: Improves performance for events like scrolling by marking them as passive.

By adding these modifiers directly to the event binding, you avoid writing extra logic in your methods. This makes your code simpler and more readable.
