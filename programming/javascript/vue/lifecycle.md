Below are step-by-step instructions to create a simple Vue.js program demonstrating a lifecycle hook. We’ll use a single HTML file with a CDN link to Vue, requiring no build tools.

**Prerequisites:**  
- A text editor  
- A modern web browser

**Steps:**

1. **Create an HTML File:**  
   Create a file named `index.html` in a directory of your choice.

2. **Add the Vue Script Tag:**  
   In `index.html`, add basic HTML and include Vue from a CDN:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8" />
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
     <title>Vue Lifecycle Hook Example</title>
     <!-- Load Vue from CDN -->
     <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>
   </head>
   <body>
     <div id="app">
       <h1>Vue Lifecycle Hook Example</h1>
       <p>{{ message }}</p>
     </div>

     <script>
       const { createApp } = Vue

       createApp({
         data() {
           return {
             message: 'Hello, Vue!'
           }
         },
         mounted() {
           // The mounted lifecycle hook runs after the component is added to the DOM.
           console.log('The component has been mounted to the DOM.')
           // You could also update data here or perform other side effects.
           this.message = 'This message was updated in the mounted hook.'
         }
       }).mount('#app')
     </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **Explanation of the Code:**
   - **The `mounted()` Lifecycle Hook:**  
     The `mounted()` hook is called after the component (in this case, our root app) is fully created, the template is compiled, and the virtual DOM is mounted to the actual DOM. This is a good place to perform actions that require the component’s elements to be present in the DOM, such as manipulating the DOM directly, starting timers, or making initial data fetches.
   
   - In the code above, the `mounted()` hook logs a message to the console and updates the `message` data property. When the page loads, you’ll see “This message was updated in the mounted hook.” displayed on the page.

4. **Run the File:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
   - Initially, “Hello, Vue!” is set as the message in `data()`, but almost immediately after mounting, the `mounted()` hook runs and changes the message to “This message was updated in the mounted hook.”
   - Check the browser’s developer console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows) to see the console log: “The component has been mounted to the DOM.”

**Key Takeaways:**
- Lifecycle hooks like `mounted()` let you run code at specific times in a component’s lifecycle.
- In this example, `mounted()` is used to log a message and update the component’s data after the component is visible on the page.
