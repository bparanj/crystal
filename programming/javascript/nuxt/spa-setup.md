In Nuxt 3, which is Vue 3 based, the framework automatically handles whether your application behaves as a Single Page Application (SPA) or uses Server-Side Rendering (SSR). By default, Nuxt 3 applications come with SSR enabled. However, you can configure your application to behave purely as an SPA by making some adjustments in your `nuxt.config.js` file.

To disable SSR and use your Nuxt 3 app as an SPA, follow these steps:

### 1. Update `nuxt.config.js`

In your `nuxt.config.js` file, set the `ssr` property to `false`:

```javascript
// nuxt.config.js
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ssr: false,
  // ... other configurations
})
```

Setting `ssr: false` tells Nuxt to skip server-side rendering and render your application only on the client side.

### 2. Build and Run the Application

After updating the configuration:

- **Build the Application**: Run the build command for your Nuxt application. This will generate the necessary files for an SPA.

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Start the Application**: Once the build is complete, you can start your application.

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

### 3. SPA Behavior

With SSR disabled, your Nuxt app will now behave like a traditional Vue SPA. The initial rendering of your application will occur in the browser, and Nuxt will not pre-render any HTML on the server side.

### 4. Routing and Navigation

Since your app is now an SPA, all routing will be handled client-side. Ensure that your navigation and routing are set up to work entirely within the browser.

### 5. Hosting Considerations

When hosting your SPA, ensure that the server is correctly configured to handle SPA routing - typically, all requests should be redirected to the `index.html` file to let the Vue router handle the routing.

### Conclusion

By setting `ssr: false` in your `nuxt.config.js`, you instruct Nuxt to operate as an SPA, similar to a standard Vue application. This approach is useful when you want to leverage Nuxt's features and ecosystem but prefer client-side rendering for your entire application.
