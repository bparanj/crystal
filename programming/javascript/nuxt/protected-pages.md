To protect pages in your Nuxt application that require a user to be logged in, you'll need to implement an authentication and authorization strategy. This involves verifying the user's authenticated state and redirecting unauthenticated users to a login page or similar. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Token Storage**:
   - When the user is authenticated via the Supabase Magic Link and the callback in your frontend extracts user details, it should also receive an authentication token (from your Rails backend) indicating the user's logged-in state.
   - Store this token securely in the client's browser,  in `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or using a client-side state management library like Vuex.

2. **Middleware for Authenticated Routes**:
   - In Nuxt.js, you can use middleware to protect routes that require authentication.
   - Create a middleware function that checks for the existence of the authentication token and verifies its validity (you might check if it's not expired or if it's properly formatted).
   - If a valid token is not found, redirect the user to the login page or show an authentication error.

3. **Integrating Middleware with Routes**:
   - Apply this middleware to routes that require authentication. In Nuxt.js, you can do this globally, or on a per-page basis by specifying the middleware in the page component's configuration.

4. **API Calls with Authentication**:
   - For API calls to your Rails backend from these protected pages, include the authentication token in the request headers.
   - This allows your Rails backend to verify the token and ensure that the request is authenticated.

5. **Handling Token Expiry and Renewal**:
   - Implement logic to handle token expiry. This could involve prompting the user to re-authenticate or automatically renewing the token, if applicable.

6. **Secure Token Transmission**:
   - Ensure that the transmission of tokens between your frontend and backend is secure,  by using HTTPS to prevent token theft.

7. **SSR Considerations**:
   - If your Nuxt app uses Server-Side Rendering (SSR), ensure that the authentication state is correctly managed between the client and server. You might need to use `nuxtServerInit` in your Vuex store to manage the auth state when the application is rendered on the server.

8. **Logout Functionality**:
   - Provide a logout mechanism that clears the stored token and resets the authentication state.

By implementing these steps, you can ensure that pages requiring login in your Nuxt application are protected and accessible only to authenticated users. This setup maintains a secure user experience while integrating smoothly with your Rails backend for authentication management.
