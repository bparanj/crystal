An S-expression (short for Symbolic Expression) is the fundamental building block of code in Lisp and its dialects. S-expressions are used to represent both code and data in a uniform and simple parenthetical notation. They can be either atoms or lists:

1. **Atoms**: These are the basic elements that cannot be further decomposed in the context of S-expressions. Atoms include symbols (like variable names), numbers, and strings. For example, `x`, `42`, and `"hello"` are all atoms.

2. **Lists**: A list is an ordered sequence of S-expressions enclosed in parentheses. Lists can contain atoms, other lists, or a combination of both. For example, `(a b c)` is a list of three symbols, and `(1 (2 3) 4)` is a list containing a number, a sublist of two numbers, and another number.

In Lisp, code is written in the form of S-expressions, where the first element of a list is  a function or operator, and the subsequent elements are the arguments to that function. For example, the S-expression `(+ 1 2)` represents a call to the `+` function with `1` and `2` as arguments, resulting in the addition of those numbers.

This structure makes Lisp unique in that its code and data share the same format, enabling powerful metaprogramming capabilities. Programs can manipulate other programs as data using the same tools they use to manipulate data structures, leading to the famous Lisp mantra, "code as data and data as code."

S-expressions provide a highly flexible and expressive way to represent code, allowing for dynamic and adaptable programming patterns. This has made Lisp and its dialects popular in areas requiring symbolic computation, such as artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and computer-aided design systems.
