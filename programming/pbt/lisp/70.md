The term LISP stands for "LISt Processing." LISP is one of the oldest high-level programming languages, designed specifically for efficient processing of lists and symbolic data. It was created by John McCarthy in 1958 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The language is particularly suited for tasks in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and symbolic mathematical computations, thanks to its powerful system for handling symbols and lists, and its support for recursive algorithms.

To install Lisp on a Mac, you have several options depending on which version or implementation of Lisp you want to use. Common Lisp and Scheme are two popular dialects of Lisp, each with multiple implementations. Here's how to install a Common Lisp implementation such as SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) and a Scheme implementation like MIT/GNU Scheme, using Homebrew, a package manager for macOS.

### Installing Homebrew

First, if you haven't installed Homebrew on your Mac, you'll need to do so because it simplifies the installation process of many UNIX tools and languages,  Lisp implementations. Open the Terminal app and run:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### Installing SBCL (Common Lisp)

To install SBCL, a popular Common Lisp implementation, use Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
brew install sbcl
```

Once the installation is complete, you can start the SBCL REPL (interactive environment) by simply typing `sbcl` in your terminal.

### Installing MIT/GNU Scheme

For those interested in Scheme, another dialect of Lisp, you can install the MIT/GNU Scheme via Homebrew with the following command:

```shell
brew install mit-scheme
```

After installation, you can start the MIT/GNU Scheme REPL by typing `scheme` in your terminal.

### Verification

To verify the installations, you can run:

- For SBCL: Type `sbcl` in the terminal. You should enter the SBCL REPL.
- For MIT/GNU Scheme: Type `scheme` in the terminal. You should enter the Scheme REPL.

### Note

The instructions above assume you're using a relatively recent version of macOS and have administrative access to your system. If there are any errors during the installation, Homebrew will usually provide suggestions on how to address them. Also, the availability of software versions and package names can change, so if you encounter any issues, checking the official Homebrew website or the specific Lisp implementation's website for the latest information might be helpful.
