## First PBT 

If `cabal test` indicates that there are no tests to run for your package, it  means that the test suite is not properly configured in your `.cabal` file. To set up a test suite in your Cabal package, follow these steps:

1. **Open Your `.cabal` File**:
   - Locate and open the `.cabal` file in the root directory of your project.

2. **Define the Test Suite**:
   - In the `.cabal` file, you need to define a test suite section. This tells Cabal about your tests and how to run them.
   - Below is a basic example of what the test suite section might look like:
     ```haskell
     test-suite spec
       type: exitcode-stdio-1.0
       hs-source-dirs: test
       main-is: Spec.hs
       build-depends: base, QuickCheck
       default-language: Haskell2010
     ```
   - Here, `spec` is the name of the test suite. You can choose any name you prefer.
   - `type: exitcode-stdio-1.0` indicates that the test suite is an executable that indicates success by exiting with code 0.
   - `hs-source-dirs: test` specifies that the source files for the test suite are located in the `test` directory.
   - `main-is: Spec.hs` points to the main file of the test suite, in this case, `Spec.hs`.
   - `build-depends` lists the dependencies for the test suite. Ensure `QuickCheck` is included if you are using it.

3. **Save the `.cabal` File**:
   - After adding or modifying the test suite section, save your changes.

4. **Update and Build the Package**:
   - Run the following commands in your project directory to update the package list and build your project:
     ```bash
     cabal update
     cabal build
     ```

5. **Run the Tests**:
   - Now, try running your tests again with:
     ```bash
     cabal test
     ```

This setup should enable Cabal to recognize and run your test suite. Remember to adjust the `build-depends` section to include any specific libraries your tests depend on. Additionally, ensure that your `Spec.hs` file in the `test` directory is correctly set up with the tests you want to run.
