## Gaurd

```haskell
pow2 n
  | n == 0    = 1
  | otherwise = 2 * (pow2 (n-1))
```

The Haskell code snippet defines a recursive function `pow2` that calculates \(2^n\), where \(n\) is a non-negative integer. This function uses guarded equations, a feature in Haskell that allows for more readable conditional expressions compared to traditional `if-then-else` statements. Let's break down how it works:

### Function Definition

- **Function Name**: `pow2` is the name of the function.

- **Parameter**: `n` is the parameter of the function, which represents the exponent to which 2 is raised.

### Guarded Equations

The function uses two guarded equations to define conditional behavior:

1. **Base Case**: `| n == 0 = 1`
   - This line checks if `n` is equal to 0. If true, the function returns 1, because \(2^0 = 1\). This serves as the base case of the recursion, terminating the recursive calls.
   
2. **Recursive Case**: `| otherwise = 2 * (pow2 (n-1))`
   - The `otherwise` keyword is used as a catch-all condition, effectively acting like an `else` in an `if-then-else` statement. This line is executed if none of the above conditions are met (in this case, if `n` is not 0).
   - This part of the function defines the recursive case, where the function calls itself with `n-1` as the new argument. It multiplies the result of this recursive call by 2, following the definition of \(2^n = 2 \times 2^{n-1}\).

In the context of the Haskell code provided, the symbol `|` is used to introduce guarded equations as part of a function definition. Guarded equations allow you to specify conditions (guards) for different parts of a function, acting similarly to if-then-else statements but in a way that's often more concise and readable, especially when there are multiple conditions to check.

Here's a breakdown of how `|` is used in your example:

```haskell
pow2 n
  | n == 0    = 1
  | otherwise = 2 * (pow2 (n-1))
```

- Each line following the `|` symbol represents a separate condition (guard) for the function `pow2`.
- The expression to the left of the `=` is the condition that needs to be true for the corresponding right side of the `=` to be evaluated and returned.
- The first guard `n == 0` checks if `n` is zero. If this condition is true, the function returns `1`.
- The keyword `otherwise` in the second guard acts as a catch-all condition, equivalent to `else` in many other programming languages. It ensures that if none of the previous guards were true, this part of the function will execute. Here, it means "in all other cases" or "if `n` is not 0".
- Guarded equations are evaluated in order, from top to bottom. The first guard that evaluates to `True` has its corresponding expression executed.

Guarded equations enhance readability and are useful for defining functions with multiple conditional branches, allowing each case to be clearly and succinctly expressed.

### How It Works

When `pow2` is called with a positive integer, it repeatedly calls itself with decrements of `n` until `n` equals 0, at which point it returns 1. The recursion stack then unwinds, multiplying 2 by itself \(n\) times, effectively computing \(2^n\).

### Example

If you call `pow2 3`, the computation unfolds as follows:

1. `pow2 3` evaluates to `2 * pow2 2`
2. `pow2 2` evaluates to `2 * pow2 1`
3. `pow2 1` evaluates to `2 * pow2 0`
4. `pow2 0` matches the base case, returning `1`
5. The recursion unwinds, computing `2 * 1`, then `2 * 2`, then `2 * 4`, resulting in `8`

### Conclusion

This function is a simple, elegant example of using recursion to calculate powers of 2, demonstrating Haskell's capabilities for mathematical computations and showcasing the use of guarded equations for defining conditional logic in a clear and concise manner.
