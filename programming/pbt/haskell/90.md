## Conditional Laws

Property is checked for 100 test cases satisfying the condition.

Likewise, the insertion function into ordered lists satisfies the law:

```haskell
prop_Insert :: Int -> [Int] -> Property
prop_Insert x xs =
ordered xs ==> ordered (insert x xs)
```

The given code snippet is an example of a property-based test written in Haskell, specifically using the QuickCheck library. It defines a property named `prop_Insert` that tests the correctness of an `insert` function, which inserts an integer into a sorted list of integers, ensuring the list remains sorted. Here's a breakdown of the code:

### Code Explanation

```haskell
prop_Insert :: Int -> [Int] -> Property
prop_Insert x xs =
  ordered xs ==> ordered (insert x xs)
```

- **Function Signature**: `prop_Insert :: Int -> [Int] -> Property`
  - This line declares the type signature of the `prop_Insert` function. It takes an `Int` and a list of `Int`s (`[Int]`) as arguments and returns a `Property`. In the context of QuickCheck, a `Property` is something that can be tested to be true or false.
  
- **Function Definition**: `prop_Insert x xs =`
  - This line starts the definition of the `prop_Insert` function, specifying that it will take two parameters: `x` (an integer to be inserted) and `xs` (a list of integers).

- **Precondition**: `ordered xs ==>`
  - The `==>` operator is used to specify a precondition for the property to be checked. In this case, `ordered xs` must be `True` for the test to proceed. The `ordered` function (not shown in the snippet) presumably checks whether the list `xs` is sorted.
  
- **Property to Test**: `ordered (insert x xs)`
  - This is the  property being tested. The expression asserts that when `x` is inserted into the sorted list `xs` using the `insert` function, the result should also be a sorted list. The `ordered` function is used again to check that the resulting list is indeed sorted.

### Summary

In summary, the `prop_Insert` property checks that for any integer `x` and any list of integers `xs` that is already sorted, inserting `x` into `xs` using the `insert` function results in a list that is also sorted. This is a common type of test in property-based testing, where instead of writing specific test cases with expected outcomes, you describe general properties that your code should satisfy and let a tool like QuickCheck generate test cases automatically. These properties help ensure the correctness of your code across a wide range of inputs.
