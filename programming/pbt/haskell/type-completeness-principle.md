Let's demonstrate the type completeness principle with a coding example in Haskell, a language known for its rich type system and support for polymorphism. We'll illustrate how Haskell's type classes enable operations to be defined in a general way, applying to any type that implements the type class, thus embodying the type completeness principle.

### Example: A Polymorphic `add` Function

First, we define a simple type class `Addable` that declares an `add` operation. This type class will allow any type that implements it to use the `add` operation, demonstrating generality and uniformity.

```haskell
class Addable a where
    add :: a -> a -> a
```

Next, we'll create instances of `Addable` for `Int` and `Double`, two numeric types, but the approach can be extended to any type where `add` makes sense.

```haskell
instance Addable Int where
    add x y = x + y

instance Addable Double where
    add x y = x + y
```

For demonstration purposes, let's extend `add` to work with a custom data type, `Point`, representing points in 2-dimensional space. This shows how we can avoid arbitrary restrictions and ensure the operation applies meaningfully across different types.

```haskell
data Point = Point Int Int deriving (Show)

instance Addable Point where
    add (Point x1 y1) (Point x2 y2) = Point (x1 + x2) (y1 + y2)
```

Now, let's use the `add` operation with `Int`, `Double`, and `Point` types to demonstrate the flexibility and type completeness:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
    -- Using add with Int
    print $ add (5 :: Int) (10 :: Int)
    
    -- Using add with Double
    print $ add (5.5 :: Double) (10.5 :: Double)
    
    -- Using add with Point
    print $ add (Point 1 2) (Point 3 4)
```

This example should produce the following output, demonstrating that `add` works uniformly across different types:

```
15
16.0
Point 4 6
```

### Conclusion

The `Addable` type class and its instances for `Int`, `Double`, and `Point` demonstrate the type completeness principle by enabling the `add` operation to work across different types. Haskell's type system, particularly its support for type classes and polymorphism, makes it an excellent language for illustrating concepts like type completeness, showcasing how operations can be generalized to work with any suitable type.

In a simple, easy to understand language, explain the meaning of:
No operation should be arbitrarily restricted in the types of its operands.

This sentence means that when you're writing or using a program, every action or operation you can do (like adding numbers, comparing values, etc.) should work with any type of data it logically should work with, without unnecessary limits. For example, if you have an operation that adds two things together, it shouldn't be limited to only working with numbers if it can also logically add other things, like pieces of text (concatenating them).

Let's say you have a tool that glues things together. It would be arbitrarily restrictive if the tool could only glue wood to wood and nothing else, even though it's perfectly capable of gluing metal to metal or paper to paper. In programming, the "glue" might be an operation like addition or comparison, and the "things" would be the types of data (numbers, text, etc.). This principle suggests that operations should be as universally applicable as possible, provided it makes sense for them to be used with those types of data.
