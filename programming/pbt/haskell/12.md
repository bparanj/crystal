## Install Haskell

### GHCup on M1 Macs

GHCup is generally a more flexible tool and has been updated to better support M1 Macs. It can install GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) that is compatible with Apple Silicon. Here's how you can use GHCup on an M1 Mac:

1. **Install GHCup**:
   - Open a terminal and run the GHCup installation script:
     ```bash
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh
     ```

2. **Install GHC**:
   - Use GHCup to install a version of GHC that supports Apple Silicon:
     ```bash
     ghcup install ghc
     ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Once installed, you can verify by running:
     ```bash
     ghc --version
     ```

### Haskell Platform on M1 Macs

The Haskell Platform's support for M1 Macs might not be as straightforward. It's advisable to check the latest information on the [Haskell Platform website](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) or Haskell-related community forums for the most current status of M1 support.

### Stack on M1 Macs

Stack, another popular Haskell build tool, also works on M1 Macs, but ensure you download a version that supports Apple Silicon or use GHCup to install it.

### General Advice

- **Check for Latest Versions**: Always check for the latest versions of these tools, as support for M1 Macs is continuously improving.
- **Use Rosetta 2 if Necessary**: If you encounter compatibility issues, you can use Rosetta 2 to run x86_64 versions of these tools on your M1 Mac. Rosetta 2 allows you to use software that has not yet been updated for Apple Silicon.
- **Community and Documentation**: Refer to community forums and official documentation for the latest compatibility information and detailed instructions.

In summary, while there has been significant progress in supporting M1 Macs, it's crucial to check the latest updates from the official sources or community forums for the most accurate and current information.

Restart your terminal for the changes to take effect,
or type "source /Users/bparanj/.ghcup/env" to apply them in your current terminal session.

To start a simple repl, run:
  ghci

To start a new haskell project in the current directory, run:
  cabal init --interactive

To install other GHC versions and tools, run:
  ghcup tui

If you are new to Haskell, check out https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/steps/

Check installed version:

```
ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 9.4.8
```

Use REPL:

```
ghci
```

to quit, type:

```
:q
```

## Install QuickCheck

To install QuickCheck, a popular library for property-based testing in Haskell, you'll  use the Cabal build system or Stack, depending on your Haskell setup. Here's how to do it using both methods:

### Using Cabal

If you're using Cabal (the standard Haskell build system and package manager):

1. **Update the Package List** (Optional but recommended):
   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```bash
     cabal update
     ```
   - This command updates the list of available packages.

2. **Install QuickCheck**:
   - Still in the terminal, run:
     ```bash
     cabal install QuickCheck
     ```
   - This installs the QuickCheck library.

### Using Stack

If you're using Stack (another popular Haskell build tool):

1. **Add QuickCheck to Your Project's Dependencies**:
   - Open the `stack.yaml` file in your Haskell project.
   - Ensure that the correct resolver is set (one that includes the version of QuickCheck you want).
   - Open your project's `.cabal` file and add `QuickCheck` to the `build-depends` section under the appropriate library or executable.

2. **Build Your Project**:
   - Run the following in your project directory:
     ```bash
     stack build
     ```
   - Stack will download and install QuickCheck along with any other dependencies for your project.

### Testing with QuickCheck

Once you have QuickCheck installed, you can start writing property-based tests. Here's a very simple example to get you started:

```haskell
import Test.QuickCheck

prop_Reverse :: [Int] -> Bool
prop_Reverse xs = reverse (reverse xs) == xs

main :: IO ()
main = quickCheck prop_Reverse
```

In this example, `prop_Reverse` is a property that checks whether reversing a list twice results in the original list.

The specific steps might vary slightly depending on your Haskell environment and the structure of your project. The above methods are general guidelines for typical Haskell setups.

```
cabal install QuickCheck

Warning:

@ WARNING: Installation might not be completed as desired! @

The command "cabal install [TARGETS]" doesn't expose libraries.
* You might have wanted to add them as dependencies to your package. In this
case add "QuickCheck" to the build-depends field(s) of your package's .cabal
file.
* You might have wanted to add them to a GHC environment. In this case use
"cabal install --lib QuickCheck". The "--lib" flag is provisional: see
https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/6481 for more information.

The output you're seeing indicates that `QuickCheck` and its dependencies (`splitmix` and `random`) were successfully downloaded and built. However, the warning at the end is important to note. 
```

In recent versions of Cabal, the `cabal install` command by default does not modify the global GHC environment. This behavior is different from older versions of Cabal, where `cabal install` would make libraries globally available to GHC. The warning is telling you about this change and providing guidance on what to do next, depending on your intentions:

1. **Adding QuickCheck to a Project**:
   - If you are working on a Haskell project and want to use QuickCheck, you should add it to the `build-depends` section of your `.cabal` file. This ensures that QuickCheck is a dependency for your project.
   - Example:
     ```haskell
     build-depends:       base >=4.7 && <5
                        , QuickCheck >=2.14 && <2.15
     ```
   - After updating your `.cabal` file, you can build your project with QuickCheck as a dependency.

2. **Adding QuickCheck to the GHC Environment**:
   - If you want to make QuickCheck available globally for GHC (outside of a specific project), you can use the `--lib` flag:
     ```bash
     cabal install --lib QuickCheck
     ```
   - This will add QuickCheck to your GHC environment, making it available for GHCi and when compiling individual Haskell files outside of a Cabal project.

The warning is essentially advising you to clarify your intention: if you are working within a specific project, update your project's `.cabal` file; if you want to use QuickCheck globally, use the `--lib` flag. The choice depends on how you plan to use QuickCheck. 

For most development work, adding QuickCheck as a dependency in your project's `.cabal` file is the recommended approach, as it ensures that your project's dependencies are clearly defined and managed.
