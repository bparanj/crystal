## Defining Generators

In QuickCheck random test data generated depends on the type. Arbitrary is a type class. A type is an instance if we can generate arbitrary elements in it.

```haskell
class Arbitrary a where
  arbitrary :: Gen a
```

Gen a is an abstract type representing a generator for type a. The programmer can either use the generators built in to QuickCheck as instances of this class or supply a custom generator using the forAll combinator. We can define the type Gen as:

```haskell
newtype Gen a = Gen (Rand -> a)
```

Rand is a random number seed. A generator is a function which can create a in a pseudo random way. We will treat Gen as an abstract type, so we define a primitive generator:

```haskell
choose :: (Int, Int) -> Gen Int
```

to choose a random number in an interval and we program other generators in terms of it. 

We also need combinators to build complex generators from simpler ones. For this, we declare Gen to be an instance of Haskell's class Monad. This involves implementing the methods of the Monad class:

```haskell
return :: a -> Gen a
(>>=)  :: Gen a -> (a -> Gen b) -> Gen b
```

The first one constructs a constant generator and the second one is the monadic sequencing operator which generates an a and passes it to its second argument to generate a b. The definition of (>>=) needs to pass independent random number seeds to its two arguments, and is only passed one seed, but luckily the Haskell random number library provides an operation to split one seed into two.
Defining generators for many types is now straightforward. As examples, we give generators for integers and
pairs:

```haskell
instance Arbitrary Int where
arbitrary = choose (-20, 20)
instance (Arbitrary a, Arbitrary b) =>
Arbitrary (a,b) where
arbitrary = liftM2 (,) arbitrary arbitrary
```

In the second case we use a standard monadic function, liftM2, which is defined in terms of return and (>>=), to
make a generator that applies the pairing operator (,) to the results of two other generators. QuickCheck contains such declarations for most of Haskell's predefined types.

## Questions

- How to provide a seed to generate a pseudo random in a given interval in Ruby

To generate a pseudo-random number within a specific interval in Ruby and provide a seed to the random number generator, you can use the `Random` class. Here's a simple, step-by-step guide:

1. **Initialize the Random Generator with a Seed**: You create an instance of the `Random` class with a specific seed. The seed ensures the sequence of random numbers is reproducible.

2. **Generate the Number**: Use the `rand` method to generate a random number. You can specify the interval as an argument to this method.

Here's an example code snippet:

```ruby
# Step 1: Initialize the Random Generator with a Seed
seed = 12345 # This is the seed you're providing
rng = Random.new(seed)

# Step 2: Generate a Random Number within a Given Interval
# Let's say the interval is from 10 to 20, inclusive
min = 10
max = 20
random_number = min + rng.rand(max - min + 1)

puts random_number
```

This code will consistently generate the same "random" number within the interval [10, 20] for the given seed (`12345`). If you change the seed, the sequence of numbers generated will be different, but still reproducible if you use the same seed again.

Key Takeaways:
- A seed in a random number generator ensures reproducibility.
- The `Random.new(seed)` is used to initialize the generator with a seed.
- `rand(max - min + 1)` generates a number in the [0, max - min] interval. Adding `min` shifts this to the desired [min, max] interval.

Using Rantly:

```ruby
require 'rantly'
require 'rantly/property'
require 'rantly/shrinks'

Rantly.singleton.seed = 12345 # Set the seed

random_number = Rantly { range(10, 20) } # Generate a number between 10 and 20

puts random_number
```

- How to build complex data generators from simpler ones in Rantly?

In Rantly, you can build complex data generators from simpler ones by combining Rantly's methods in a block. The key is to use Rantly's declarative DSL to describe the structure of the data you want to generate. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Start with Basic Generators**: Rantly provides basic generators like `int`, `string`, `range`, etc., that you can use as building blocks.

2. **Use Blocks to Create Structures**: You can use Ruby blocks to define more complex structures like arrays, hashes, or custom objects. Inside the block, you can call other Rantly generators.

3. **Combine Generators**: Use Rantly's `array`, `dict`, or custom methods within blocks to create complex nested structures.

Hereâ€™s an example that illustrates how to build a complex data generator for a hypothetical user data structure, which includes a name, age, and a list of favorite colors:

```ruby
require 'rantly'
require 'rantly/extension'

# Generate complex user data
user_data = Rantly.new.generate do
  { 
    name: string, # Generates a random string for the name
    age: range(18, 100), # Generates a random age between 18 and 100
    favorite_colors: array(3) { choose('red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'purple') } # Generates an array of 3 favorite colors
  }
end

puts user_data.inspect
```

In this example:

- `string` generates a random string.
- `range(18, 100)` generates a random integer between 18 and 100.
- `array(3) { choose('red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'purple') }` generates an array of 3 elements, each a random choice among the specified colors.

This approach lets you easily compose simple generators to build more complex and structured data, tailored to your testing or data generation needs.
