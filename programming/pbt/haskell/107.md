## Partial Application

Partial application in Haskell is a powerful concept that allows you to call a function with fewer arguments than it requires, resulting in another function that takes the remaining arguments. This is possible because of Haskell's curried functions. 

### Understanding Currying

Every function in Haskell is technically a function of one argument. Functions that seem to take multiple arguments are curried functions. Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions each with a single argument.

### Example of Partial Application

Consider a simple function that adds two numbers:

```haskell
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y
```

Although `add` looks like it takes two arguments, it can be understood as a function that takes one argument and returns a function that takes another argument and then returns the result. You can partially apply `add` by supplying only one of its arguments:

```haskell
addFive :: Int -> Int
addFive = add 5
```

Here, `addFive` is a partially applied version of `add`, which adds 5 to its argument. You've created a new function by supplying less than the total number of arguments `add` requires.

### Benefits of Partial Application

1. **Code Reusability**: It allows you to create new functions from existing ones without rewriting them.
2. **Simplification**: Helps simplify complex expressions. By partially applying functions, you can reduce the complexity of your code.
3. **Function Composition**: Facilitates easier function composition, making it more straightforward to build up complex operations from simpler ones.

### Practical Example

Let's say you have a list of numbers and you want to add 3 to each number. You can use the `map` function along with partial application:

```haskell
incrementList :: [Int] -> [Int]
incrementList = map (add 3)
```

Here, `(add 3)` is a partially applied function that adds 3 to its argument. `map (add 3)` applies this function to every element in a list.

### Key Takeaways

- Partial application is a technique enabled by currying, allowing functions to be applied to some, but not all, arguments.
- It is used extensively in Haskell for creating more specific functions from general ones and for simplifying code.
- Understanding and utilizing partial application can lead to more concise, readable, and elegant Haskell programs.

Partial application addresses several problems in software development, particularly in functional programming languages like Haskell. Here are the problems it helps solve:

### 1. **Code Duplication**

Without partial application, you might find yourself writing several similar functions that differ only in one or a few arguments. Partial application allows you to abstract these commonalities into a single function and create specialized versions of this function by fixing some of its arguments.

**Example**: Instead of writing multiple functions to add specific numbers, you can have one addition function and create specialized versions of it by partially applying specific operands.

### 2. **Boilerplate Code**

In scenarios where you need to pass around functions that require more parameters than you currently want to provide, partial application reduces the need for boilerplate code. You can create a version of the function with some parameters fixed, simplifying the interfaces between parts of your code.

**Example**: If you have a function that's  used with a particular parameter, you can create a partially applied version of it, reducing the need for repeatedly specifying that parameter.

### 3. **Function Composition and Higher-Order Functions**

Functional programming often involves composing functions together or using higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments). Partial application makes it easier to work with these patterns by allowing you to adjust the arity (number of arguments) of functions to fit into the expected interfaces.

**Example**: When composing functions, you might need a function that takes exactly one argument, but your function takes two. You can use partial application to create a one-argument version of the function.

### 4. **Flexibility in Function Invocation**

Partial application increases the flexibility of function invocation, allowing developers to construct more versatile and reusable functions. It enables a form of "argument accumulation," where a function can be called with arguments over time rather than all at once.

**Example**: Creating configurations or settings for a function that will be applied later can be easily managed through partial application.

### 5. **Simplification of Complex Expressions**

In mathematical or complex logical operations, partial application can simplify expressions by breaking down functions into simpler, more manageable pieces. This can make the code more readable and easier to understand.

**Example**: Breaking down a complex calculation into simpler, partially applied functions can make each step of the calculation clearer and more modular.

### Key Takeaways

- **Reduces Redundancy**: Partial application helps avoid redundant code by enabling the reuse of function logic with different arguments.
- **Improves Readability**: It simplifies expressions and makes code more expressive by clearly showing the intent of partially applied arguments.
- **Enhances Modularity**: By allowing functions to be broken down into simpler, more focused units, partial application supports modularity in code design.
- **Facilitates Reusability and Composition**: It aids in creating reusable code components and in the composition of functions, a core principle of functional programming.

In summary, partial application is a powerful tool in the functional programming paradigm, addressing common problems related to code duplication, boilerplate, flexibility, and complexity in software development.

## Origin

Partial application, as a concept, originates from the broader field of lambda calculus and functional programming. Lambda calculus, developed by Alonzo Church in the 1930s, is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application. It serves as the theoretical foundation of functional programming languages.

The practice of partial application is closely related to currying, named after Haskell Curry, an American mathematician and logician. Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument. This transformation enables partial application by allowing functions to be applied to some of their arguments ahead of time, returning a new function that takes the remaining arguments.

### Historical Context

- **Lambda Calculus**: The roots of partial application lie in the lambda calculus, which introduced the idea of functions as first-class citizens, capable of being passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and stored in variables. This theoretical groundwork made partial application a natural fit for functional programming.
  
- **Functional Programming Languages**: The concept was further developed and popularized through functional programming languages like Lisp (created in the late 1950s), ML, and Haskell. Haskell, in particular, named after Haskell Curry, strongly emphasizes currying and partial application in its design, making these concepts central to Haskell programming.

### Development and Adoption

- **Early Adoption**: Early functional programming languages adopted these concepts from lambda calculus and theoretical computer science, incorporating them as key features.
  
- **Haskell and ML**: These languages, developed in the late 20th century, were designed with a strong emphasis on functional programming concepts,  first-class functions, currying, and partial application. They helped to popularize the practical use of these concepts in software development.

- **Modern Programming**: Today, the influence of partial application and currying extends beyond purely functional languages. Many modern programming languages,  those with multi-paradigm support like JavaScript, Scala, and Python, offer features that enable or mimic partial application, reflecting its utility in a wide range of programming contexts.

### Key Takeaways

Partial application as a programming concept is not attributed to a single origin point or moment of invention. Instead, it evolved from the foundational principles of lambda calculus and has been integral to the development and adoption of functional programming languages. Its utility in enabling more expressive, modular and concise code has led to its widespread acceptance and use in various programming paradigms today.
