## Case Expression

```haskell
removeOdd [] = []
removeOdd (x : xs)
  | mod x 2 == 0 = x : (removeOdd xs)
  | otherwise = removeOdd(xs)

anyEven nums = case (removeOdd nums) of
  []       -> False
  (x : xs) -> True
```

The Haskell code provided defines two functions, `removeOdd` and `anyEven`, which work together to determine if there are any even numbers in a list. Let's break down each function:

### Function `removeOdd`

This function filters out all odd numbers from a list, leaving only the even numbers.

- **Base Case**: `removeOdd [] = []`
  - For an empty list, the function returns an empty list. This serves as the base case for recursion.

- **Recursive Case**: `removeOdd (x : xs)`
  - This part uses pattern matching to deconstruct the list into its head (`x`) and tail (`xs`).
  - It then uses guarded equations to check conditions:
    - `| mod x 2 == 0 = x : (removeOdd xs)` checks if `x` is even (using `mod x 2 == 0`). If so, it keeps `x` and recurses on the rest of the list (`xs`), effectively filtering the list to remove odd numbers.
    - `| otherwise = removeOdd(xs)` is the catch-all case for when `x` is odd. It simply skips `x` and recurses on `xs`, continuing the filtering process.

### Function `anyEven`

This function checks if there are any even numbers in a list by utilizing the `removeOdd` function.

- It applies `removeOdd` to the input list `nums`, which filters out all the odd numbers, leaving only the even ones (if any).

- The `case` expression then examines the result of `removeOdd nums`:
  - `[] -> False` matches if the result is an empty list, meaning all numbers were odd, and hence, there are no even numbers, returning `False`.
  - `(x : xs) -> True` matches if the result is a non-empty list (i.e., there's at least one even number), returning `True`. The pattern `(x : xs)` matches any list with at least one element, but the specific values of `x` and `xs` are not used here, as the presence of any element is enough to conclude that there's at least one even number.

### Summary

- `removeOdd` recursively filters a list to keep only even numbers.
- `anyEven` uses `removeOdd` to determine if there are any even numbers in the original list. If `removeOdd` returns a non-empty list, `anyEven` returns `True`, indicating the presence of at least one even number. If `removeOdd` returns an empty list, `anyEven` returns `False`, indicating there were no even numbers.

This pair of functions demonstrates a common pattern in functional programming, where one function processes data (in this case, filtering a list), and another function uses this processed data to make a determination or calculation.
