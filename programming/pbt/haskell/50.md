## QuickCheck Paper Tasks

### Find a Small Counter Example

Begin testing each property on small test cases and then gradually increase the size bound as testing progresses.

Intent:

Generate array with some random data. The size of the array will begin from 0 and increase by 1 till it reaches 20. The elements are random within the range -100 and 100. Provide code in Ruby. 

My Cousing Vinny:

Here's the Ruby code to generate arrays with sizes increasing from 0 to 20, where the elements are random numbers within the range -100 to 100:

Ruby code to generate arrays of sizes 0 to 20 with random elements in the range -100 to 100:

```ruby
arrays = (0..20).map do |size|
  Array.new(size) { rand(-100..100) }
end
```

This code uses the `map` method to create an array for each size from 0 to 20. Inside the block, it uses `Array.new(size)` to create an array of the given size, and for each element in the array, it assigns a random number between -100 and 100 using `rand(-100..100)`. Uncomment the last two lines if you wish to print each array along with its size and contents.

To display the arrays:

```ruby
arrays.each_with_index { |arr, index| puts "Array #{index} (size #{arr.size}): #{arr.inspect}" }
```

The Rantly gem in Ruby is a property testing library similar in spirit to Haskell's QuickCheck. It allows for the generation of random test data according to specified properties. While Rantly is primarily used for property-based testing, it can also generate random data structures,  arrays with elements within a specified range.

To achieve something similar to your example using Rantly, you would not directly map over a range to create arrays of increasing size as you do in the straightforward Ruby code. However, you can use Rantly to generate arrays of random sizes (within a specified range) and fill them with random integers within your desired range. Here's how you might approximate your request with Rantly:

```ruby
require 'rantly'
require 'rantly/property'
require 'rantly/shrinks'

arrays = Rantly.map(21) do
  size = range(0, 20) # This will generate sizes between 0 and 20, inclusive.
  array(size) { range(-100, 100) } # Generate an array of 'size' elements, each within -100 to 100.
end

# The above Rantly code generates 21 arrays, with sizes from 0 up to 20, and elements within -100 to 100.
```

This Rantly code snippet does the following:
- Generates 21 arrays (using `Rantly.map(21)`).
- For each array, it generates a size between 0 and 20 (inclusive).
- It then fills each array with random integers between -100 and 100.

Note that this isn't a direct translation of your Ruby code but rather a way to use Rantly to generate a similar set of arrays with random sizes and elements within a specified range. The `range` method is used both to determine the size of the array and the range of the integers within each array. This approach leverages Rantly's capabilities for generating random data for testing or other purposes.

Indeed, for the specific task of generating arrays of increasing sizes filled with random numbers within a certain range, using a straightforward approach in Ruby without Rantly is simpler and more direct. Rantly, and similar property-based testing libraries, are primarily designed for generating random test cases to check properties of code, rather than for generating specific data structures with precise characteristics.

For tasks focused on data generation without the specific needs of property-based testing, sticking to Ruby's built-in methods, like `rand`, within a simple loop or iteration method, is more straightforward and easier to understand. This approach minimizes complexity and keeps the code more readable, especially for those not familiar with the additional abstraction layer that Rantly introduces.

Here's the original Ruby code snippet for generating arrays of sizes 0 to 20 with random elements in the range -100 to 100, which is indeed simpler and more direct for this use case:

```ruby
arrays = (0..20).map do |size|
  Array.new(size) { rand(-100..100) }
end
```

This code snippet is efficient for creating a series of arrays with the specified characteristics without the overhead and complexity of a property-based testing library. It's a good example of choosing the right tool for the job, prioritizing simplicity and clarity when the advanced features of a library like Rantly are not required.
