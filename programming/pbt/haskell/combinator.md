In lambda calculus, a **combinator** is a lambda expression that does not contain any free variables. This means every variable used in the expression is defined or "bound" within the expression itself,  as a parameter of the lambda function.

Let's examine each of the given lambda expressions to determine if they are combinators:

1. **洧랝洧논.洧논洧논洧논**
   - This expression is a combinator. Every instance of \(x\) in the expression is bound by the lambda abstraction \(\lambda x\). There are no variables used in the expression that are not parameters of the function.

2. **洧랝洧논洧녽.洧녾洧논**
   - This expression is **not** a combinator. It uses \(z\) which is not defined or bound within the lambda expression. Therefore, \(z\) is a free variable, making the whole expression not a combinator.

3. **洧랝洧논洧녽洧녾.洧논洧녽(洧녾洧논)**
   - This expression is a combinator. All variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) used in the expression are parameters of the lambda function (\(\lambda xyz\)), making them all bound within the expression.

4. **洧랝洧논洧녽洧녾.洧논洧녽(洧녾洧논洧녽)**
   - This expression is a combinator. Similar to the previous example, all variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are bound within the lambda expression, making this a combinator.

5. **洧랝洧논洧녽.洧논洧녽(洧녾洧논洧녽)**
   - This expression is **not** a combinator. It uses \(z\) which is not defined or bound within the lambda expression, making \(z\) a free variable. Since there's at least one free variable, the expression is not a combinator.

### Simple Explanation

A combinator is like a self-contained recipe that doesn't need any ingredients from outside. If an expression uses only the ingredients it mentions at the start (its parameters), it's a combinator. If it needs something not mentioned at the start (a free variable), it's not a combinator.
