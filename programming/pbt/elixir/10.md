## Recursive Generator

```elixir
def path() do
	path({0,0}, [], %{{0,0} => :seen}, [])
end
```

The `path` function is a custom function written in Elixir. It is part of a set of functions designed to generate and manipulate a path in a 2D grid.

The function takes no arguments and calls another function also named `path` with four arguments:

1. `{0,0}`: This is a tuple representing the starting point of the path in the grid. The grid is assumed to be a 2D grid with coordinates, and `{0,0}` represents the origin point.

2. `[]`: This is an empty list, which could be used to store the path as it is generated. Each element in the list could represent a step or a point in the path.

3. `%{{0,0} => :seen}`: This is a map with a single key-value pair. The key is the tuple `{0,0}`, and the value is the atom `:seen`. This map could be used to keep track of the points in the grid that have already been visited by the path. The atom `:seen` indicates that the point has been visited.

4. `[]`: This is another empty list, which could be used to store the directions that have been taken or should be ignored in the path generation.

```elixir
def path(_current, acc, _seen, [_,_,_,_]) do 
	acc
end

def path(current, acc, seen, ignore) do
  frequency([
    {1, acc},
    {15, increase_path(current, acc, seen, ignore)}
	])
end
```

The two `path` functions are part of a recursive algorithm, used for generating or traversing a path in a 2D grid.

The first `path` function is a base case for the recursion. It matches when the fourth argument is a list with exactly four elements (which could represent four directions in a 2D grid). When this condition is met, the function simply returns the current path `acc`.

The second `path` function is the recursive case. It uses the `frequency` generator from the PropCheck library to either return the current path `acc` or to continue generating the path. The `frequency` generator is used to generate a value from a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a weight and a generator. The generator for a tuple is chosen with a probability proportional to its weight.

In this case, the weights and generators are as follows:
- 1 time out of 16, it returns the current path `acc`.
- 15 times out of 16, it continues generating the path by calling the `increase_path` function with the current position, the current path, the seen positions, and the ignored directions.

This function is a good example of how to use property-based testing to generate complex, realistic test data. It generates a large number of paths in a 2D grid and checks that a function behaves as expected with all these inputs.

```elixir
  def path() do
    sized(
      size,
      path(size, {0,0}, [], %{{0,0} => :seen}, [])
    )
  end

  def path(0, _current, acc, _seen, _ignore) do
    acc
  end
  def path(_max, _current, acc, _seen, [_,_,_,_]) do
    acc
  end
  def path(max, current, acc, seen, ignore) do
      increase_path(max, current, acc, seen, ignore)
  end

  def increase_path(max, current, acc, seen, ignore) do
    let direction <- oneof([:left, :right, :up, :down] -- ignore) do
      new_pos = move(direction, current)
      case seen do
        %{^new_pos => _} ->
          path(max, current, acc, seen, [direction|ignore])
        _ ->
          path(
            max-1,
            new_pos,
            [direction|acc],
            Map.put(seen, new_pos, :seen),
            []
          )
      end
    end
  end

  def move(:left, {x, y}), do: {x-1, y}
  def move(:right, {x, y}), do: {x+1, y}
  def move(:up, {x, y}), do: {x, y+1}
  def move(:down, {x, y}), do: {x, y-1}
```

The set of Elixir functions generate a path in a 2D grid using the PropCheck library. The path starts at the point `{0,0}` and moves in one of four directions: left, right, up, or down. The path generation stops when it reaches a maximum size or when it cannot move in any new direction.

The `path` function is the entry point. It uses the `sized` function from PropCheck to generate a path of a certain size. The `size` argument is passed to the `path` function along with the starting point `{0,0}`, an empty list to store the path, a map to keep track of the seen points, and another empty list to store the ignored directions.

There are three versions of the `path` function to handle different cases:

1. When the size is 0, it returns the current path `acc`.
2. When there are four ignored directions, it also returns the current path `acc`.
3. Otherwise, it calls the `increase_path` function to continue generating the path.

The `increase_path` function generates a new direction that is not in the ignored list, calculates the new position, and checks if it has been seen before:

- If the new position has been seen, it calls the `path` function with the same arguments, but adds the current direction to the ignored list.
- If the new position has not been seen, it calls the `path` function with the size decreased by 1, the new position, the current direction added to the path, the new position marked as seen, and an empty ignored list.

The `move` function calculates the new position based on the current direction and position. It subtracts or adds 1 to the x or y coordinate depending on the direction.

This is a good example of how to use property-based testing to generate complex, realistic test data. It generates a large number of paths in a 2D grid and checks that a function behaves as expected with all these inputs.
