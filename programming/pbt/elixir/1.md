## Elixir Hello World

```elixir
defmodule Pbt do
  @moduledoc """
  Documentation for Pbt.
  """

  @doc """
  Hello world.

  ## Examples

      iex> Pbt.hello
      :world

  """
  def hello do
    :world
  end
end
```

This is a module written in Elixir, a functional programming language. The module is named `Pbt`.

At the top of the module, there's a `@moduledoc` attribute. This is a special attribute in Elixir that's used to provide documentation for the module. The text enclosed in triple quotes (`"""`) is the documentation content. This content can be accessed programmatically and is also used to generate documentation pages when using tools like ExDoc.

Inside the module, there's a function named `hello`. Just like the module, this function also has a `@doc` attribute for its documentation. The documentation includes a section called "Examples" which shows how to use the function. The example demonstrates that calling `Pbt.hello` will return the atom `:world`.

The `hello` function itself is very simple. It's a function with no parameters (hence the `do` after the function name without any parentheses) that returns the atom `:world`. In Elixir, the last expression in a function is its return value, and there's no need for a `return` keyword.

This code is a good example of how to write self-documenting code in Elixir. The use of `@moduledoc` and `@doc` attributes makes it clear what the module and function do, and the example usage in the function's documentation helps users understand how to use it.

GitHub Copilot: Here is the equivalent Ruby code for your Elixir module:

```ruby
# Documentation for Pbt
class Pbt
  # Hello world.
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   Pbt.hello
  #   # => :world
  #
  def self.hello
    :world
  end
end
```

In Ruby, modules are  used for namespacing or mixing in functionality, while classes are used when you want to create instances. Since the Elixir module `Pbt` defines a function `hello`, it's more appropriate to use a Ruby class in this case. The `self` keyword is used to define a class method, which is the equivalent of a function in an Elixir module.
