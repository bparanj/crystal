## Symmetric Properties

```elixir
  property "symmetric encoding/decoding" do
    forall data <- list({atom(), any()}) do
      encoded = encode(data)
      is_binary(encoded) and data == decode(encoded)
    end
  end

  def encode(t), do: :erlang.term_to_binary(t)
  def decode(t), do: :erlang.binary_to_term(t)
```

The test is named "symmetric encoding/decoding" and it verifies that the `encode` and `decode` functions are symmetric, meaning that decoding the encoded data gives back the original data.

The `forall` macro is used to generate test cases. Here, `data` is a variable that will hold the randomly generated values, and `list({atom(), any()})` is a generator that produces lists of tuples, where each tuple contains an atom and any Elixir term. For each generated list, the test encodes the data using the `encode` function, checks that the result is a binary, and then decodes the encoded data using the `decode` function and checks that the result is equal to the original data.

The `encode` function uses the `:erlang.term_to_binary` function to convert an Elixir term to a binary. The `decode` function uses the `:erlang.binary_to_term` function to convert a binary back to an Elixir term.

This test is a good example of how to use property-based testing to verify the correctness of a pair of functions that are supposed to be inverses of each other. It generates a large number of test cases with random inputs and checks that the functions behave as expected in all cases. This can help catch edge cases and other issues that might not be caught with example-based tests.
