If textbooks in computer science were rewritten to catalog specific effects and phenomena similar to how physics might catalog phenomena like "Corona Discharge," we could expect to see a comprehensive listing of fundamental principles, algorithms, design patterns, and perhaps even common bugs or anti-patterns that are well-recognized in the field. Here are some categories and examples of what such a catalog in computer science might include:

### 1. **Fundamental Principles**
- **Information Theory**: Concepts like entropy, information gain.
- **Computability Theory**: Church-Turing thesis, decidability, NP-completeness.

### 2. **Algorithms and Data Structures**
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort.
- **Data Structures**: Binary trees, hash maps, linked lists.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra's algorithm, A* search, graph traversal (BFS, DFS).

### 3. **Software Engineering Principles**
- **Design Patterns**: Singleton, observer, factory patterns.
- **Principles**: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), SOLID principles, KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).

### 4. **Programming Paradigms**
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
- **Functional Programming**: Pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions.

### 5. **Systems and Architecture**
- **Operating System Concepts**: Process scheduling, memory management.
- **Network Protocols**: TCP/IP model, HTTP, WebSocket.
- **Distributed Systems**: Consensus algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft), microservices architecture.

### 6. **Common Bugs and Anti-patterns**
- **Software Bugs**: Off-by-one errors, race conditions, memory leaks.
- **Anti-patterns**: God object, spaghetti code, magic numbers.

### 7. **Emerging Technologies and Concepts**
- **Quantum Computing**: Superposition, entanglement, quantum algorithms (Shor's, Grover's).
- **Machine Learning**: Neural networks, overfitting, reinforcement learning.

### 8. **Ethical and Societal Impacts**
- **Security and Privacy**: Cryptography basics, ethical hacking, data protection laws.
- **Societal Impact**: Bias in AI, digital divide, technology accessibility.

### Key Takeaways

This catalog would serve multiple purposes:
- **Educational Resource**: Offering a structured way to learn and reference core concepts and techniques in computer science.
- **Professional Reference**: Helping practitioners quickly find information on standard practices, algorithms, and design patterns.
- **Innovation Stimulus**: By cataloging known concepts, it encourages identification of gaps and areas for innovation.

Just as in physics, where cataloging phenomena can lead to a deeper understanding of the fundamental laws of nature, in computer science, such a catalog could enhance understanding of computational principles, leading to more efficient, effective, and innovative technology solutions.
