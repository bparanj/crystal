## Logic Error

Give one example of a logic error in a program, using the language of your choice.

Let's consider an example in Python, focusing on a common logic error related to loop control.

### Scenario: Sum of Even Numbers

The goal is to calculate the sum of even numbers within a given range,  both start and end points. However, due to a logic error, the program does not perform as expected.

#### Incorrect Program:
```python
# Intended to sum even numbers between 1 and 10, inclusive
sum_even = 0
for number in range(1, 11):
    if number % 2 == 1:  # Logic error here
        sum_even += number

print("Sum of even numbers:", sum_even)
```

#### Logic Error:
The condition in the `if` statement incorrectly checks for odd numbers (`number % 2 == 1`) instead of even numbers. As a result, the program sums the odd numbers rather than the even ones.

#### Corrected Version:
To fix the logic error, the condition in the `if` statement should be corrected to check for even numbers.

```python
sum_even = 0
for number in range(1, 11):
    if number % 2 == 0:  # Corrected condition
        sum_even += number

print("Sum of even numbers:", sum_even)
```

In the corrected version, the program correctly identifies even numbers (`number % 2 == 0`) and sums them, resulting in the expected output for the sum of even numbers between 1 and 10, inclusive.
