Name equivalence forces each distinct type to be defined in one and only one place. This is sometimes inconvenient, but it helps to make the program more maintainable. (If the same type is defined in several places, and subsequently it has to be changed, the change must be made consistently in several places.)

Let's break down the paragraph for better understanding:

### Name Equivalence

Name equivalence, in the context of programming languages, means that two types are considered the same only if they have the same name or are explicitly declared as equivalent. This approach is about using the names of types to determine their equivalence.

### Each Distinct Type Defined Once

The paragraph states that name equivalence requires each unique type to be defined in just one place in the code. This means you can't have two separate definitions for what is essentially the same type, even if those definitions are structurally identical.

### Advantages and Inconveniences

- **Inconvenience**: This rule can sometimes be inconvenient for programmers. For example, if you need a type that's very similar to one you've already defined elsewhere, you can't just redefine it where you need it. You would have to use the original type, even if it's defined in a different part of your program, which might not always feel intuitive or straightforward.

- **Maintainability**: Despite the inconvenience, this restriction helps make the program more maintainable in the long run. If you had the same type defined in multiple places and then needed to update its structure (say, add a new field), you'd have to make sure you updated it consistently everywhere it's defined. This can be error-prone and time-consuming. By forcing each type to be defined only once, name equivalence ensures that any change to a type's definition automatically applies everywhere that type is used, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.

### Example

Imagine you have a type `User` defined in your program to represent a user. With name equivalence, this `User` type is defined in one place only. If later on, you decide that you need to add an email address to your `User` type, you only have to update the `User` definition in one place. Every part of your program using `User` will now know about the email address. If you were allowed to define `User` in multiple places, you'd have to update each definition individually, which increases the chance of missing one and introducing bugs.

### Conclusion

The paragraph highlights a trade-off between the convenience of being able to define types wherever they're needed and the long-term maintainability of the code. Name equivalence opts for the latter, ensuring that each type has a single, authoritative definition that must be updated in one place, simplifying maintenance and reducing the risk of errors.
