## Factorial in Scala, Clojure and F#

Define a recursive factorial function in the following languages: Scala, Clojure and F#.

Here are the definitions of a recursive factorial function in Scala, Clojure, and F#:

### Scala
```scala
def factorial(n: Int): BigInt = {
  if (n <= 1) 1
  else n * factorial(n - 1)
}
```
In Scala, `BigInt` is used to handle very large numbers that may result from calculating factorial of large `n`.

### Clojure
```clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  (if (<= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (dec n)))))
```
Clojure uses a very concise syntax for defining functions. The `dec` function decreases the number by one.

### F#
```fsharp
let rec factorial n =
    if n <= 1 then 1
    else n * factorial (n - 1)
```
F# uses the `let rec` syntax to define a recursive function. This is a common pattern for recursive functions in F#.

Each of these examples demonstrates how to define a simple recursive factorial function in its respective language, adhering to the language's syntax and idioms for recursion.
