In the context of programming language design, an expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and functions that are constructed according to the syntax of the language and can be evaluated to produce another value. This means that when the program runs, each expression is processed (or computed) to result in a single value, which can be of any type defined within the language, such as an integer, a string, a boolean, or more complex data structures.

### Key Characteristics of Expressions

1. **Composability**: Expressions can be composed of smaller expressions, allowing for complex expressions to be built up from simpler ones. This composability is a fundamental aspect of expressions, enabling a modular approach to defining behavior in a program.

2. **Evaluability**: Every expression can be evaluated to yield a value. This evaluation process may involve calculations (for arithmetic expressions), logical operations (for boolean expressions), function or method invocations (for call expressions), and more.

3. **Side Effects**: Some expressions, when evaluated, not only produce a value but also cause side effects. Side effects are changes in the state of the program or the system environment, such as modifying a variable's value, printing to the console, or writing to a file. However, in purely functional programming languages like Haskell, expressions are designed to be free of side effects, emphasizing referential transparency (an expression's value doesn't change between uses) and predictability.

4. **Types**: The value that an expression evaluates to has a type, and the type system of the programming language dictates what operations are permissible for values of that type. Type systems can enforce constraints at compile time (static typing) or runtime (dynamic typing), influencing the design and safety of expressions.

### Examples

- **Arithmetic Expression**: `3 + 4 * 2` is an arithmetic expression that evaluates to `11`.
- **Boolean Expression**: `x > 5` evaluates to `True` or `False`, depending on the value of `x`.
- **Function Call**: `sqrt(16)` calls the `sqrt` function with `16` as an argument and evaluates to `4`.
- **Conditional Expression**: In many languages, expressions like `(x > 5) ? x : 5` evaluate to `x` if `x` is greater than `5`, or `5` otherwise.

### Conclusion

Expressions are central to programming language design, providing the means to specify computations and define the logic of programs. The design of expression syntax and semantics is a key aspect of a programming language's usability, power, and flexibility, affecting how intuitively and efficiently developers can express algorithms and operations.

In the context of programming language design, terms can be classified based on their role and behavior in the language. Here's how the terms you've mentioned fit into the broader classification:

### Literals
Literals are the most basic form of expressions representing fixed values directly in the code. They are not evaluated to produce a value; they are the value. Examples include numeric literals (`42`, `3.14`), string literals (`"hello"`), and boolean literals (`True`, `False`).

### Constructions
Constructions refer to expressions that create complex data structures or instances of types from simpler elements. This can include object creation in object-oriented languages, record construction in functional languages, or even array and list initializations. Constructions are often syntactically distinct and can involve literals, variable references, or more complex expressions as arguments.

### Function Calls
Function calls are expressions that invoke a function with a set of arguments and evaluate to the function's return value. This category includes both calls to user-defined functions and invocations of built-in functions or methods provided by the language's standard library.

### Conditional Expressions
Conditional expressions evaluate to different values based on a condition. The most common form is the `if-else` expression, which chooses between two expressions based on a boolean condition. Some languages also offer ternary operators (`condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression`) as shorthand for simple `if-else` conditions.

### Iterative Expressions
Iterative expressions (or loops) repeatedly evaluate an expression or a block of expressions based on a condition, typically for side effects (like mutating state or performing I/O operations) rather than to produce a value. While not all programming languages treat loops as expressions that yield a value, in some functional languages, even loops can be expressed in a way that they result in a value (e.g., using recursion or higher-order functions like `fold`).

### Constant and Variable Accesses
- **Constant Accesses** refer to the use of named constants in expressions. Constants are fixed values defined in the program, typically at the global level, that do not change during execution.
- **Variable Accesses** involve referencing variables by their names to retrieve their current values. Variable accesses are evaluated to the value the variable holds at the time of access.

These classifications help in understanding the components of a programming language and how they are used to construct programs. Each plays a crucial role in defining the syntax and semantics of the language, influencing how developers write code and express computations.
