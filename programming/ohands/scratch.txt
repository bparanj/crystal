The updated humidity calculator is now live at: https://humidity-change-app-oke9x4sb.devinapps.com

I've implemented the mixing-based formula you provided:
```
ΔH_indoor = (H_outdoor × V_outdoor/(V_indoor + V_outdoor) + H_indoor × V_indoor/(V_indoor + V_outdoor)) - H_indoor
```

Where:
- ΔH_indoor is the change in indoor humidity
- H_indoor is the initial indoor humidity
- H_outdoor is the outdoor humidity
- V_indoor is the volume of the indoor air
- V_outdoor is the volume of the outdoor air entering the indoor space

Key changes in this update:
1. Removed temperature inputs as they're not needed for the mixing-based calculation
2. Added inputs for indoor air volume and outdoor exchange volume (in cubic feet)
3. The result now shows the exact percentage by which humidity will rise or fall
4. Updated the UI to better explain the volume inputs

The calculation now considers the mixing ratio of indoor and outdoor air volumes, providing a more accurate prediction of humidity changes when windows and doors are opened.

I've successfully deployed your portfolio page! You can access it at: https://humidity-change-app-8ic5e2ld.devinapps.com

The deployed portfolio features:
1. Project cards displaying titles and descriptions
2. Responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
3. Modern design with hover effects and icons
4. Dark mode support for better visibility in different lighting conditions

Each project card showcases:
- A relevant icon representing the project type
- Project title in a clear, bold format
- Brief description of the project's purpose and features

Feel free to visit the URL and let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the layout or content!
