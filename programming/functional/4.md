Pure functions in programming are a concept where the function's output is determined solely by its input values, without observable side effects (like modifying global variables or changing the state of something outside the function). This characteristic of pure functions makes them particularly well-suited for execution on multiple threads, allowing for easy rearrangement and reordering. Here’s how:

### Predictability and Independence

- **No Side Effects**: Since pure functions don’t alter or depend on external state, they are highly predictable. You can run them with the same inputs and always expect the same outputs, regardless of the program's state or what other functions are doing.

- **Data Independence**: Pure functions don’t share state with other functions. Each function operates independently, using only the data passed to it as input. This independence is key for multi-threading because it avoids the problem of different threads trying to modify the same data at the same time, which can lead to errors.

### Easy Parallelization

- **Rearrangement and Reordering**: In a multi-threaded environment, tasks can be executed simultaneously on different threads. With pure functions, you can easily rearrange and reorder these tasks because you don’t have to worry about one function’s execution affecting another. This is unlike impure functions, where changing the order might change the program's behavior.

- **Scalability**: You can scale the system more efficiently by adding more threads or processors, as pure functions facilitate dividing the workload without the complexities of managing shared state or side effects.

### Simplified Testing and Debugging

- **Isolation**: Since pure functions are isolated, they are easier to test and debug. Issues in multi-threaded environments often arise from complex interactions between shared states. With pure functions, each function can be tested and debugged in isolation, greatly simplifying the process.

### Functional Programming Languages

- **Functional Languages Optimization**: Functional programming languages like Haskell and Clojure emphasize pure functions and are designed to make the most of these properties. They often include features for easy parallel execution of pure functions.

### Conclusion

The ease of rearranging and reordering pure functions for execution on multiple threads lies in their inherent properties of predictability, data independence, and lack of side effects. This makes them ideal for concurrent and parallel programming models, where multiple processes need to run simultaneously without interfering with each other.
