Here's how you would write a simple program to increment a given number by 1 in each of the requested languages:

### Clojure
```clojure
(defn increment [x]
  (+ x 1))
```

### Elixir
```elixir
defmodule Math do
  def increment(x) do
    x + 1
  end
end
```

### Haskell
```haskell
increment :: Int -> Int
increment x = x + 1
```

### Scala
```scala
object Math {
  def increment(x: Int): Int = x + 1
}
```

### F#
```fsharp
let increment x = x + 1
```

Each of these snippets defines a function or method to increment a given number. To use these functions, you would call them with a specific number as the argument. For example, in Clojure, you would use `(increment 5)`, which would return `6`, and similarly for the other languages.
