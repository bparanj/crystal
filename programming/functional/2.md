Here are simple programs to filter odd numbers from a given list:

### Clojure
```clojure
(defn filter-odd [numbers]
  (filter odd? numbers))
```

### Elixir
```elixir
defmodule ListUtils do
  def filter_odd(numbers) do
    Enum.filter(numbers, fn x -> rem(x, 2) != 0 end)
  end
end
```

### Haskell
```haskell
filterOdd :: [Int] -> [Int]
filterOdd = filter odd
```

### Scala
```scala
object ListUtils {
  def filterOdd(numbers: List[Int]): List[Int] = {
    numbers.filter(_ % 2 != 0)
  }
}
```

### F#
```fsharp
let filterOdd numbers = 
  List.filter (fun x -> x % 2 <> 0) numbers
```

In each of these snippets, a function is defined to take a list (or array) of numbers as input and return a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. The specific syntax and function names vary across languages, but the general approach is the same: use a filter function and a condition that checks if a number is odd.
