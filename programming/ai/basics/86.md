Encoding process taking place in the Neural Network layers and how non-linearities are introduced

Let's break down the encoding process in neural networks and how they bring in that crucial non-linearity:

**The Encoding Process: From Raw Data to Abstract Representations**

* **Input Layer: Your Starting Point**  Here, raw data is simply fed in. If  using images, each pixel's intensity might be a neuron's value.
* **Hidden Layers: Where Transformation Happens** Each layer performs these steps:
    1. **Weighted Sum:** Each neuron receives its inputs. Inputs get multiplied by their corresponding weights and summed up. 
    2. **Adding a Bias:**  Think of this as shifting the decision 'threshold' of the neuron. 
    3. **Activation Function (The Non-Linear Magic):**  The weighted sum + bias passes through a non-linear function (like sigmoid, ReLU). This output becomes the input to the next layer's neurons.

* **Output Layer: Decision Time** The final layer often uses an activation function that's tailored to the task the network is solvingâ€”classification, regression, etc. Output neurons might even represent probabilities of belonging to different categories.

**Why Non-linearity Matters**

1. **Real-World Complexity:** Most real-world relationships aren't perfectly linear. Think of the curve in  the road versus a straight line. Linear combinations of your inputs cannot model these shapes.

2. **Flexible Decision Boundaries:** Non-linear activation functions let each neuron define complex decision boundaries in the data. One neuron might fire only when certain combinations of inputs in the previous layer exceed a threshold.  

3. **Hierarchical Feature Learning:** With multiple layers, simple features learned early on (edges, color blobs) are combined in successive layers to form higher-order features (shapes, objects) and eventually drive the final decision.  

**Examples of  Non-linearities**

* **Sigmoid:** Smooth S-shaped curve. Historically popular, it squashes output between 0 and 1.
* **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** Popular now!  Very simple: 0 for negative inputs, and just passes along positive inputs unchanged. This simplicity speeds up training.
* **Tanh:**  S-shaped, similar to sigmoid, but squashes output between -1 and 1.

Without non-linearities, neural networks would be just very complicated linear models. Each layer adds flexibility by defining "bendy" partitions in the data space instead of just straight lines.
