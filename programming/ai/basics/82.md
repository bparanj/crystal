Concept of Stationary Time Series, testing for stationarity and conversion techniques to transform non-stationary time series into stationary

Let's break down stationarity in time series, why it matters, and how to deal with it:

**Concept of Stationary Time Series**

* **Steady as She Goes:**  A stationary time series exhibits statistical properties that don't drastically change over time. 
    * **Mean (Average):** Roughly constant over time.
    * **Variance:**  The spread of the data stays relatively consistent.
    * **Covariance:**  The way two points in the series relate to each other stays similar across different time windows. 

* **Why Care?** Many time series forecasting models are built on the assumption of stationarity. They expect the data's structure to continue into the future. If your data violates this, predictions become unreliable.

**Testing for Stationarity**

Here are a few common approaches:

1. **Visual Inspection:**  
    * Plot your time series. Does it have a visible trend (upward/downward movement)? Are there major, unpredictable changes in variance?  This is your first gut check.

2. **Statistical Tests:**  
    * **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test:**   Checks for the presence of a unit root (a cause of non-stationarity). You want a low p-value with this test to suggest stationarity.
    * **KPSS Test:** Tests for stationarity around a trend or seasonality. This test, in some ways, is the opposite of the ADF.

**Transformation Techniques for Non-Stationary Data**

If your data fails the stationarity tests, here's your toolkit:

1. **Differencing:**
    * Calculate the difference between consecutive values in the series. 
    * This often gets rid of trends, making the data more stable.
    * You may need to do this multiple times (second-order differencing, etc.)

2. **Detrending:** 
    * Fit a line (or a curve) to capture the overall upward/downward trend in your data.
    * Subtract this trend to detrend the series.

3. **Log Transformations:**
    * If your data exhibits huge swings in scale, taking the logarithm can "compress" it and stabilize the variance.

4. **Stabilizing the Variance**
    * Techniques like the Box-Cox transformation can help normalize the spread of your data across time.

**Notes**

* **Choice of Technique:** The best transformation depends on the nature of non-stationarity in your data. Experimentation is often key.
* **Over-differencing:** Be careful not to difference too many times – you could remove meaningful information along with the instability.

Imagine you're trying to train a program to make sense of stock prices. Stationarity tests are like unit tests; if they fail, transformations are like refactoring: Cleaning up your data so your program can extract reliable insights for forecasting future movements.

Write a Python program for Stationary Time Series

Python program that demonstrates how to work with and verify a stationary time series.

1. Generate a synthetic stationary time series, for example, an autoregressive process AR(1) where \(|\phi| < 1\). This ensures stationarity.
2. Visualize the series.
3. Perform the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to confirm it is stationary.

**Steps:**

- Generate a stationary AR(1) process:  
  \(X_t = \phi X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t\) with \(|\phi|<1\) and \(\epsilon_t \sim N(0,\sigma^2)\).
- Plot the time series.
- Use `statsmodels` to run the ADF test and show that the series is likely stationary.

**Code**

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

# Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# 1. Generate a stationary time series
# Parameters for the AR(1) process
phi = 0.7  # AR coefficient, |phi|<1 ensures stationarity
sigma = 1.0
n = 200

# Generate noise
epsilon = np.random.normal(0, sigma, n)

# Initialize array
X = np.zeros(n)
# Let's start from some random initial point
X[0] = np.random.normal(0, sigma/(1-phi**2)**0.5)  # long-term variance for AR(1): sigma^2/(1-phi^2)

# Generate AR(1) process
for t in range(1, n):
    X[t] = phi * X[t-1] + epsilon[t]

# Convert to a pandas series with a time index
dates = pd.date_range(start='2020-01-01', periods=n, freq='D')
ts = pd.Series(X, index=dates)

# 2. Plot the time series
plt.figure(figsize=(10,4))
plt.plot(ts, label='Stationary AR(1) Series')
plt.title('Stationary Time Series Example')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# 3. Perform ADF test to verify stationarity
def adf_test(series, title=''):
    print(f'Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test: {title}')
    result = adfuller(series, autolag='AIC')
    labels = ['ADF Statistic', 'p-value', '# Lags Used', '# Observations Used']
    out = pd.Series(result[0:4], index=labels)
    for key, val in result[4].items():
        out[f'Critical Value ({key})'] = val
    print(out)
    if result[1] <= 0.05:
        print("=> The series is likely stationary.")
    else:
        print("=> The series is likely non-stationary.\n")

adf_test(ts, "Stationary AR(1) Series")
```

**What This Code Does:**

- Generates a stationary AR(1) time series by ensuring the AR coefficient \(\phi\) is less than 1 in magnitude.
- Plots the series to visualize that it fluctuates around a constant mean, without a systematic trend.
- Runs the ADF test, which should yield a p-value less than 0.05, indicating the data is likely stationary.

**Adjustments:**

- Change \(\phi\) closer to 1 or -1 and re-run to see how the ADF test behaves.  
- Experiment with different \(\phi\) values or add a mean shift to see how non-stationarity arises if \(|\phi| \ge 1\).
- Apply differencing or transformations if you introduce non-stationary behavior, to restore stationarity.

Create a video for Stationary Time Series

Python code that creates a video to illustrate the concept of stationarity in a time series. 

1. Generate a stationary time series, for example an AR(1) process with \(|\phi|<1\).
2. Simultaneously, we will track the rolling mean and variance over time as we reveal the series data point by point.
3. At each frame of the animation:
   - Add one new data point to the plot.
   - Compute the rolling mean and variance of all revealed data points.
   - Show that the rolling mean and variance remain relatively stable, illustrating stationarity.

- This code uses `matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation` to create an MP4 file.
- Requires `ffmpeg` to save the animation as MP4.
- This is a conceptual demonstration. In reality, stationarity tests like the ADF test are used, but here we rely on visual cues (stable mean and variance over time).

**Code (run locally):**

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation

np.random.seed(42)

# Length of the series
N = 200

# Parameters for an AR(1) process: X_t = phi*X_{t-1} + epsilon_t
phi = 0.7
sigma = 1.0

# Generate noise
epsilon = np.random.normal(0, sigma, N)
X = np.zeros(N)
# Initialize starting point from stationary distribution mean=0, var=sigma^2/(1-phi^2)
X[0] = np.random.normal(0, sigma/np.sqrt(1-phi**2))

for t in range(1, N):
    X[t] = phi*X[t-1] + epsilon[t]

# We'll animate revealing one point at a time and updating rolling mean/variance
fig, (ax_main, ax_stats) = plt.subplots(2,1, figsize=(8,6), gridspec_kw={'height_ratios':[2,1]})
fig.suptitle('Demonstration of a Stationary Time Series', fontsize=14)

# Main plot: time series
line, = ax_main.plot([], [], 'b-', label='Stationary Series')
ax_main.set_xlim(0, N)
# Set y-limits generously
ax_main.set_ylim(X.min()-2, X.max()+2)
ax_main.set_xlabel('Time')
ax_main.set_ylabel('Value')
ax_main.legend(loc='upper left')

# Stats plot: rolling mean and variance
line_mean, = ax_stats.plot([], [], 'g-', label='Rolling Mean')
line_var, = ax_stats.plot([], [], 'm-', label='Rolling Variance')
ax_stats.set_xlim(0, N)
ax_stats.set_ylim(-0.5, 2.5)  # Adjust as needed
ax_stats.set_xlabel('Time')
ax_stats.set_ylabel('Value')
ax_stats.set_title('Rolling Mean & Variance')
ax_stats.legend(loc='upper left')

def init():
    line.set_data([], [])
    line_mean.set_data([], [])
    line_var.set_data([], [])
    return line, line_mean, line_var

def update(frame):
    # frame: 0 to N-1
    current_data = X[:frame+1]
    line.set_data(range(frame+1), current_data)
    # Compute rolling mean & variance with a window = frame+1 (entire revealed data)
    if frame > 0:
        mean_val = np.mean(current_data)
        var_val = np.var(current_data, ddof=1) if frame > 0 else 0
        # We'll store them in arrays if we like to animate them cumulatively
        means = [np.mean(X[:i+1]) for i in range(frame+1)]
        vars_ = [np.var(X[:i+1], ddof=1) if i>0 else 0 for i in range(frame+1)]
        line_mean.set_data(range(frame+1), means)
        line_var.set_data(range(frame+1), vars_)
    else:
        line_mean.set_data([], [])
        line_var.set_data([], [])

    return line, line_mean, line_var

anim = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=N, init_func=init, blit=False, repeat=False)

# Save animation as MP4 (requires ffmpeg)
anim.save('stationary_series_demo.mp4', writer='ffmpeg', fps=10)

plt.show()
```

**What This Code Does:**

- Simulates a stationary AR(1) process.
- Creates an animation where we reveal the time series point by point.
- At each frame, we update the plot of the series and show how the rolling mean and variance evolve.
- Because the series is stationary, the rolling mean and variance remain relatively stable over time.

**Adjustments:**

- Modify the AR(1) parameter `phi` closer to 1 or negative values to see how stability changes.
- Change the sigma or length of the series.
- Add horizontal lines for mean and variance to emphasize their stability.

After running the code locally, open `stationary_series_demo.mp4` to view a conceptual demonstration of stationarity over time.

Write a Python program for Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test

Python program that demonstrates how to perform the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test on a given time series. The ADF test is commonly used to check for stationarity. If the test’s p-value is low (usually ≤ 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity and conclude that the series is likely stationary.

**Steps:**

1. Load or generate a time series.
2. Use `statsmodels`' `adfuller` function to run the ADF test.
3. Interpret the results.

**Code:**

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

# Example: Generate a random walk (non-stationary) series
np.random.seed(42)
n = 200
noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, n)
time_series = np.cumsum(noise) + 10  # starting around 10

# Convert to pandas Series with a time index
dates = pd.date_range('2020-01-01', periods=n, freq='D')
ts = pd.Series(time_series, index=dates)

# Plot the series
plt.figure(figsize=(10,4))
plt.plot(ts, label='Time Series')
plt.title('Example Time Series')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Define a function to perform and print ADF test results
def adf_test(series, title=''):
    print(f'Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test: {title}')
    result = adfuller(series, autolag='AIC')
    labels = ['ADF Statistic', 'p-value', '# Lags Used', '# Observations Used']
    out = pd.Series(result[0:4], index=labels)
    for key, val in result[4].items():
        out[f'Critical Value ({key})'] = val
    print(out)
    if result[1] <= 0.05:
        print("=> The series is likely stationary.\n")
    else:
        print("=> The series is likely non-stationary.\n")

# Perform the ADF test on the generated series
adf_test(ts, 'Random Walk Series')
```

**What This Code Does:**

- Creates a synthetic random walk, which is typically non-stationary.
- Runs the ADF test using `adfuller`.
- Prints out test statistics, p-value, and critical values.
- Concludes whether the series is stationary based on the p-value.

**Adjustments:**

- Use your own time series data instead of generating one.
- Change the p-value threshold or print more interpretation details.
- Combine with differencing or transformations if the series is non-stationary and retest.

Create a video for Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test

Python code that creates a video to illustrate the usage of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. 

1. Generate a non-stationary time series (a random walk).
2. Reveal the time series data one point at a time in an animation.
3. At each frame:
   - Show the current portion of the time series.
   - Run the ADF test on the currently revealed data.
   - Display the ADF p-value on the plot, indicating the test’s conclusion about stationarity so far.
4. Once the entire non-stationary series is shown, illustrate how differencing the series changes the ADF test result.

- This example shows a random walk that remains non-stationary. The p-value will likely stay high.  
- After the final frame, we will differ the series and show the ADF test result on the differenced series, demonstrating that differencing can help achieve stationarity (low p-value).
- Requires `ffmpeg` installed to save the animation as MP4.
- Computation and I/O for the ADF test at each frame may slow down the animation. For demonstration purposes, we use fewer data points or accept slower generation.

**Code (run locally):**

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

np.random.seed(42)

# Length of series
N = 100
noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, N)
# Generate a random walk (non-stationary)
X = np.cumsum(noise) + 10
dates = pd.date_range('2020-01-01', periods=N, freq='D')
ts = pd.Series(X, index=dates)

fig, (ax_main, ax_diff) = plt.subplots(2,1, figsize=(8,6))
fig.suptitle("Demonstration of ADF Test on Non-Stationary vs Stationary Series", fontsize=12)

line_orig, = ax_main.plot([], [], 'b-', label='Original Series')
text_adf = ax_main.text(0.5, 0.9, '', transform=ax_main.transAxes, ha='center', va='center', fontsize=10,
                        bbox=dict(boxstyle='round', facecolor='white', alpha=0.7))
ax_main.set_title("Non-Stationary Series (Random Walk)")
ax_main.set_xlabel('Time')
ax_main.set_ylabel('Value')
ax_main.legend()

ax_diff.set_title("Differenced Series (After All Data Revealed)")
ax_diff.set_xlabel('Time')
ax_diff.set_ylabel('Value')

def run_adf(series):
    result = adfuller(series, autolag='AIC')
    p_value = result[1]
    return p_value

def init():
    ax_main.set_xlim(ts.index[0], ts.index[-1])
    y_min, y_max = ts.min(), ts.max()
    ax_main.set_ylim(y_min-2, y_max+2)
    # We'll fill the differenced series after animation ends
    return line_orig, text_adf

def update(frame):
    current_data = ts.iloc[:frame+1]
    line_orig.set_data(current_data.index, current_data.values)
    p_val = run_adf(current_data)
    text_adf.set_text(f"ADF p-value: {p_val:.4f}\n"
                      f"{'Likely Non-Stationary' if p_val>0.05 else 'Likely Stationary'}")
    return line_orig, text_adf

def on_animation_end():
    # Once done, differ the series and run ADF again
    differenced = ts.diff().dropna()
    ax_diff.plot(differenced.index, differenced.values, 'g-', label='Differenced Series')
    diff_pval = run_adf(differenced)
    ax_diff.text(0.5, 0.9,
                 f"After differencing:\nADF p-value: {diff_pval:.4f}\n"
                 f"{'Likely Stationary' if diff_pval<=0.05 else 'Likely Non-Stationary'}",
                 transform=ax_diff.transAxes, ha='center', va='center', fontsize=10,
                 bbox=dict(boxstyle='round', facecolor='white', alpha=0.7))
    ax_diff.legend()
    plt.draw()

anim = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=N, init_func=init, blit=False, repeat=False)

# After animation completes, differ the series and show results
def anim_ended(*args):
    on_animation_end()

anim._stop = anim_ended

# Save the animation as MP4 (requires ffmpeg)
anim.save('adf_test_demo.mp4', writer='ffmpeg', fps=5)

plt.show()
```

**What This Code Does:**

- Creates a random walk time series (non-stationary).
- Animates revealing the series point by point, running the ADF test at each step and showing the p-value.
- At the end of the animation, differ the entire series and run the ADF test again to show how differencing achieves stationarity.

**Adjustments:**

- Increase or decrease N for a longer/shorter animation.
- Change the ARIMA-type process or transform the data to show different stationarity properties.
- Add lines or annotations for critical values or other stationarity indicators.

After running the code locally, open `adf_test_demo.mp4` to view a conceptual demonstration of how the ADF test behaves as new data is revealed, and how differencing can create a stationary series with a low p-value.
