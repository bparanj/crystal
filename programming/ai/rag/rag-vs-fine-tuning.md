**Different Purposes**  
1. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Keeps data external. Dynamically retrieves facts from a knowledge base. Avoids retraining the model when knowledge changes.  
2. **Fine-Tuning**: Trains the model’s parameters to adapt to a specific domain or style. Usually needs stable or well-defined data.

**When to Choose Fine-Tuning Alone**  
1. **Stable Domain**: Knowledge doesn’t change often.  
2. **Deep Specialization**: You want the model to learn patterns and tone unique to your data.  
3. **Ownership**: You can manage a custom training workflow and have enough data.

**When to Choose RAG Alone**  
1. **Frequent Updates**: You need the latest facts without re-training.  
2. **Large Knowledge Base**: It’s impossible or too costly to encode all details in model parameters.  
3. **Memory/Cost Constraints**: Fine-tuning big models can be expensive; retrieval is simpler to manage.

**When to Use Both**  
1. **Domain Adaptation + Live Updates**: Fine-tune to capture style and repeated patterns, then retrieve current facts through RAG.  
2. **Complex Queries**: The tuned model can interpret queries better, while external data ensures correctness.  
3. **Scalability**: You can expand or alter knowledge sources without re-training the whole model.

**Decision Criteria**  
- **Data Volatility**: How often does knowledge change?  
- **Budget**: Fine-tuning large models can be costly.  
- **Performance Needs**: Do you need highly nuanced domain language or just factual accuracy?  
- **Implementation Complexity**: Will your team maintain custom training pipelines or manage external knowledge bases?

By combining or selecting one method, you balance domain expertise (fine-tuning) with on-demand accuracy (RAG).
