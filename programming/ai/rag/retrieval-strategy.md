**Retrieval Design**

1. **Indexing Strategy**  
   - Convert documents into embeddings (vector representations) if you want semantic search.  
   - Use a keyword-based index (like BM25) for faster but less semantic retrieval.  
   - Combine both approaches in a hybrid system if you need high accuracy and coverage.

2. **Query Processing**  
   - Transform the user’s query into the same embedding space (for vector search) or tokenized form (for keyword search).  
   - Use a re-ranking step if you need finer precision in the top results.

3. **Context Augmentation**  
   - Select the most relevant segments.  
   - Concatenate or format them into a prompt.  
   - Pass the augmented prompt to the generative model.

**Choosing a RAG Framework**

1. **Lightweight RAG**  
   - Minimal data pipeline.  
   - Limited indexing (often keyword-based).  
   - Faster to implement, good for smaller projects.

2. **Vector-based RAG**  
   - Uses embeddings and a vector database (e.g., Faiss, Pinecone).  
   - Semantically finds relevant text even if exact keywords differ.  
   - Suited for domains with varied or unstructured data.

3. **Hybrid RAG**  
   - Combines keyword-based and vector retrieval.  
   - Helps ensure both precision (keyword match) and recall (semantic match).  
   - Scales well with large or diverse data sources.

Match your retrieval strategy to your data’s nature and the complexity of queries. For projects that demand high accuracy and flexibility, a vector or hybrid approach usually works best. For simpler needs or smaller data sets, a lightweight RAG can be sufficient.
