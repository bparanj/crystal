**1. Choose the Right Storage Layer**  
- **Raw vs. Processed**: Decide if you need to keep the original data (e.g., PDFs, text files) alongside processed data (e.g., cleaned text, vector embeddings).  
- **Structured vs. Unstructured**: Use relational databases for structured data or specialized document and vector stores for unstructured data.

**2. Plan for Data Volume**  
- **Estimate Current Needs**: Determine how many documents or records you must store.  
- **Anticipate Growth**: Project expansion over time. Factor in frequent updates or new data sources.

**3. Consider Retrieval Requirements**  
- **Indexing Strategy**: Decide how to index your data (e.g., full-text search, vector search).  
- **Performance Needs**: High concurrency or large queries may require distributed indexing solutions.  
- **Caching**: Store commonly accessed data in memory or a fast cache to reduce latency.

**4. Balance Cost and Complexity**  
- **Data Lifecycle**: Not all data must live in high-performance storage. Archive older or rarely accessed data.  
- **Hardware vs. Cloud**: Compare your own infrastructure to cloud-based services for cost, maintenance, and scalability.

By aligning storage choices with the type and volume of data, a RAG AI application can quickly retrieve relevant text, scale efficiently, and keep overall complexity in check.
