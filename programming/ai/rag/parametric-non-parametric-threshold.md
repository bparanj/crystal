**Step 1: Evaluate the Existing Parametric Model**  
1. **Coverage**: Does it already cover the required domain or use cases?  
2. **Accuracy**: How well does it handle queries? Are there frequent hallucinations?  
3. **Recency**: Is it outdated compared to the domain’s evolving knowledge?  
4. **Complexity**: Does it support advanced reasoning or specialized tasks?

**Step 2: Assess the Need for Non-Parametric Knowledge**  
1. **Data Availability**: Is there external data you must incorporate that the model does not have?  
2. **Timeliness**: Must you accommodate updates without retraining the entire model?  
3. **Depth**: Do you need more detailed content or specialized documents not “memorized” by the model?  

**Step 3: Decide on Hybrid vs. Pure Parametric**  
1. **If the model alone suffices**: Stick to parametric. Keep it simple if it’s accurate and up to date.  
2. **If the model has gaps**: Add a non-parametric retrieval step. This RAG layer fetches the missing data.  
3. **Cost and Complexity**: Weigh the extra infrastructure against the potential benefits.  

**Step 4: Pilot and Validate**  
1. **Prototype**: Build a minimal RAG pipeline.  
2. **Test**: Compare results with and without retrieval.  
3. **Evaluate**: Check accuracy, latency, and user satisfaction.  

Through this process, you can pinpoint whether a standalone parametric approach suffices or if you need an explicit RAG layer to fill in knowledge gaps.
