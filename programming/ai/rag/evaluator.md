A common term for the component responsible for measuring model performance (via metrics), overseeing human-in-the-loop evaluation, and collecting feedback for improvements is often the **“evaluation and feedback loop”** (or simply **“evaluation module”**). This layer handles both automated quantitative metrics (like accuracy, precision, or recall) and qualitative human assessments, then feeds those insights back into the system for tuning and iteration.
