**Assess the Data Sources**  
1. **Identify the sources** (internal documents, databases, external APIs).  
2. **Understand format and structure** (text, PDF, structured tables).  
3. **Check timeliness** (how often it gets updated).

**Validate Reliability**  
1. **Authority**: Is the source from an expert or a credible organization?  
2. **Accuracy**: Is the data free of errors or noise?  
3. **Consistency**: Are there conflicting pieces of information?

**Determine Sufficiency**  
1. **Coverage**: Does the data address user queries comprehensively?  
2. **Depth**: Does it have the necessary level of detail?  
3. **Scalability**: Can you add more data easily if needed?

**Implementation Considerations**  
1. **Preprocessing**: Clean and format data.  
2. **Indexing**: Make data easily retrievable.  
3. **Versioning**: Track changes over time.  

A well-structured pipeline ensures RAG applications can reliably retrieve the right information at the right time.
