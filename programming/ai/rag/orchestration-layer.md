Name for handles input augmentation, prompt engineering, and generation in RAG AI application

In many RAG architectures, the component that handles input augmentation, prompt engineering, and ultimately invokes the generative model is often referred to as the **“orchestration layer”** (sometimes called the **“prompt orchestration layer”** or **“generation pipeline”**). This layer unifies the retrieved data with user context, engineers the final prompt, and then generates the response.
