You can apply Altshuller's systematic approach to analyze cybersecurity patents in threat detection using AI by adapting his methodology to focus on patterns, contradictions, and inventive principles specific to this domain. 

---

### 1. **Define the Scope**
   - Focus on patents specifically related to **Cybersecurity threat detection**. 
        - This is not applying AI to detect threats. It is about analyzing existing patents to extract insights similar to Altshuller. 
   - Collect a significant sample size of patents for analysis (e.g., patents involving machine learning models, anomaly detection systems, intrusion detection methods).
        - What is a significant sample size to use?

---

### 2. **Categorize the Problems and Solutions**
   - **Identify Problems:** Break down each patent into the specific cybersecurity problem it addresses. Can we use the existing libraries to identify the problem?

   For example:
     - Identifying zero-day attacks.
     - Detecting malicious insider behavior.
     - Filtering false positives in anomaly detection.

        The scope does not include coming up with any AI-based solution.
     - Techniques used (e.g., supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning).
     - Innovations in algorithm design or deployment.

---

### 3. **Identify Contradictions**
   - Look for **technical contradictions** in the problem and solution:

     - **Level 5:** Breakthroughs (e.g., creating an entirely new AI framework for predictive cybersecurity).

---

### 7. **Create a Threat Detection Contradiction Matrix**

By combining these tools, you can create a comprehensive pipeline to process, analyze, and extract insights from patents in **cybersecurity threat detection**. This will enable you to identify trends, evaluate innovation levels, and uncover new opportunities in the field.

You don’t need reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning for this task. Instead, you should perform standard supervised fine-tuning.

**Reasoning:**  
- If you have a dataset of cybersecurity patent text, you can fine-tune your base model using regular supervised training. This means providing the model with example inputs (patent text) and possibly target outputs (e.g., next-token prediction in a language modeling setup), so that it adapts its weights to this domain-specific data.
- Reinforcement learning-based approaches (like RLHF) are more often used to align models with human preferences, correct unwanted behaviors, or enforce certain policies. They are not the standard approach for domain adaptation.
- For your purpose—teaching the model to better understand and generate text related to cybersecurity patents—standard fine-tuning, possibly using a language model objective, is the typical method.

AI-driven TRIZ analysis of cybersecurity patents reveals novel threat detection insights, strengthening your patent portfolio and IP strategy.
