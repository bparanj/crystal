Your project’s unique focus on applying **TRIZ methodology** to analyze patents using **AI** makes it distinct from other existing open-source projects. None of the listed projects align with this goal. Let’s break this down in the context of **TRIZ’s approach** and **AI capabilities**:

---

### **Key Goals of Your Project**
1. **Embracing TRIZ’s Patent Analysis**:
   - Analyze patents for contradictions and resolutions.
   - Identify recurring patterns, principles, and innovative trends, similar to Altshuller’s methodology.
   
2. **Leveraging AI**:
   - Use AI to automate the identification of patterns, contradictions, and resolutions.
   - Analyze and classify patents at scale with machine learning and NLP techniques.

3. **Focus on Cybersecurity Domain**:
   - Specifically target patents related to cybersecurity threat detection.

---

### **Why Your Project Stands Out**
- **TRIZ Inspiration**:
  - Altshuller’s manual analysis of patents to identify inventive principles and contradictions is a structured, domain-agnostic approach.
  - Incorporating TRIZ principles (e.g., 40 Inventive Principles, Contradiction Matrix, Ideal Final Result) into an AI framework for patent analysis has not been explicitly attempted in open-source projects.
  
- **AI for TRIZ**:
  - Existing AI patent analysis tools (e.g., PQAI, PatentInspector) focus on search and topic modeling but do not align with TRIZ’s systematic framework.
  - Your project will teach AI to extract contradictions and map resolutions, emulating human-like creativity.

- **Cybersecurity Context**:
  - Applying this framework to cybersecurity patents bridges a gap between innovation analysis and a practical, high-demand domain.

---

### **Relevant Overlaps with Existing Projects**
1. **NLP-Based Patent Processing**:
   - **PQAI** and **PatentInspector** provide tools for processing and visualizing patent data, which could serve as a foundation for building TRIZ-specific workflows.
2. **Cybersecurity AI Applications**:
   - **Awesome ML for Cybersecurity** and similar resources can inspire or contribute algorithms for your project’s domain-specific analysis (e.g., clustering cybersecurity threats in patents).

---

### **How Your Project Differentiates**
- **TRIZ Framework Integration**:
  - None of the existing projects aim to automate the TRIZ-inspired analysis (e.g., extracting contradictions, applying inventive principles).
- **Domain-Specific Focus**:
  - Your project’s application of TRIZ specifically to **cybersecurity threat detection patents** gives it a defined, practical scope.

---

Your project is unique in combining **TRIZ-inspired patent analysis** with **AI-driven automation**. This approach does not overlap with existing open-source projects, making it a pioneering effort in the field. It can provide actionable insights for innovation, in a critical domain like cybersecurity. 

---

None of the open-source projects listed have the **exact same goal** as your project—integrating **AI-driven patent analysis** specifically for **cybersecurity threat detection**. However, there are overlaps in functionality, focus areas, or methodologies. 

---

### **1. PQAI (Patent Quality through Artificial Intelligence)**  
- **Goal**: Enhance patent search and prior art discovery using AI.  
- **Relation to Your Project**:
  - PQAI focuses on AI-powered patent searches but is not tailored for cybersecurity or analyzing patents for trend detection or contradictions.
  - It provides tools to extract and analyze patent text, which could be adapted for your project.
- **Usefulness**:  
  - The search algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques can inspire your patent data extraction and preprocessing pipeline.

---

### **2. IMPACT (Integrated Multimodal Patent Analysis)**  
- **Goal**: Analyze patents with a focus on design patents and multimodal datasets.  
- **Relation to Your Project**:
  - Focused on multimodal patent data (e.g., images, captions), which is broader than cybersecurity.
  - It does not target extracting innovation trends or resolving contradictions in cybersecurity.
- **Usefulness**:  
  - Offers a large-scale patent dataset and a framework for multimodal analysis, which could provide insights for scaling your project.

---

### **3. PatentInspector**  
- **Goal**: Provide tools for analyzing and visualizing patent data.  
- **Relation to Your Project**:
  - PatentInspector is focused on general patent data visualization and does not have a domain-specific focus on cybersecurity or threat detection.
  - It overlaps in patent data preprocessing and trend visualization capabilities.
- **Usefulness**:  
  - The visualization techniques and preprocessing workflows can complement your prototype's backend.

---

### **4. Awesome Machine Learning for Cybersecurity**  
- **Goal**: Curate resources and tools for applying machine learning in cybersecurity.  
- **Relation to Your Project**:
  - While this focuses on AI and cybersecurity, it does not analyze patents or attempt to identify trends in cybersecurity innovation.
- **Usefulness**:  
  - The machine learning algorithms and tools for cybersecurity (e.g., anomaly detection, threat prediction) could inspire the design of AI models in your project.

---

### **5. Awesome AI in Cybersecurity Resources**  
- **Goal**: Provide tools for using AI in various cybersecurity tasks.  
- **Relation to Your Project**:
  - Similar to the previous project, it addresses AI in cybersecurity but does not analyze patents or innovation trends.
- **Usefulness**:  
  - The curated list of AI resources could be helpful for choosing specific libraries or models to integrate into your project.

---

None of these projects combine **cybersecurity** and **AI-driven patent analysis** with the specific goals of:
1. Identifying innovation trends in threat detection.
2. Extracting contradictions from patent claims.
3. Mapping resolutions to support research and development.

However, they provide complementary tools and methods that can inform and accelerate parts of your development. **Your project has a unique niche and value proposition** by bridging the gap between patent data analysis and practical cybersecurity advancements.
