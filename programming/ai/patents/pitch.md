### **Pitch for Sponsors: Open-Source Cybersecurity Patent Analysis with AI**

---

#### **Introduction**
The cybersecurity landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, with new threats emerging daily. Patents play a crucial role in documenting innovative solutions to these challenges. However, the wealth of information locked in patent repositories often goes underutilized due to the complexity of analyzing and extracting actionable insights from them.

We aim to build an **open-source AI-driven platform** to analyze cybersecurity patents, uncover trends, identify contradictions, and inspire innovation in threat detection. This project will be hosted on GitHub, fostering collaboration and transparency.

---

#### **The Problem**
Cybersecurity professionals and researchers face key challenges:
1. **Overwhelming Volume**: Thousands of patents are filed annually, making it difficult to stay updated.
2. **Scattered Information**: Patent insights are often buried in dense legal language, requiring significant effort to extract.
3. **Missed Opportunities**: Without analysis, it’s hard to identify trends, gaps, or reusable solutions.

These issues slow innovation and reduce the practical value of patents for threat detection.

---

#### **Our Solution**
We are building an **AI-powered open-source platform** that:
- **Automates Patent Analysis**: Extracts keywords, identifies trends, and highlights contradictions using NLP and machine learning.
- **Enables Collaboration**: Provides a GitHub-hosted platform for researchers and developers to contribute to patent insights.
- **Inspires Innovation**: Offers clear data visualizations and insights to guide future research and development in threat detection.
