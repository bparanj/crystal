### **Guide to Preparing Labeled Data for Fine-Tuning**

Fine-tuning an existing model requires **high-quality labeled data** that represents your specific tasks (e.g., extracting contradictions, summarizing patents, or classifying TRIZ principles). Below is a step-by-step guide:

---

### **1. Define the Annotation Goals**
Determine what you want the model to learn. Common goals for CyberShu include:
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Annotate contradictions, resolutions, principles, and key entities in the patent text.
- **Classification**: Label patents by TRIZ principles, contradiction types, or innovation levels.
- **Summarization**: Provide concise summaries for claims or descriptions.
- **Similarity Matching**: Group patents by related innovations.

---

### **2. Select the Data**
#### **Data Sources**
- **Patent Text**:
  - Use publicly available patent datasets from:
    - [Google Patents Public Dataset](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/google-patents-public-datasets-connecting-public-patent-data-to-the-innovation-ecosystem)
    - [USPTO Bulk Data](https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/)
    - [Lens.org](https://www.lens.org/)

#### **Choose Relevant Fields**:
Focus on structured patent text, including:
- **Abstract**: High-level summary of the invention.
- **Claims**: Detailed description of what the patent protects.
- **Description**: Broader explanation of the invention.

---

### **3. Label the Data**

#### **NER Task (Extract Contradictions, Resolutions, and Principles)**
1. Use annotation tools like:
   - **[Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/)**: Free and highly customizable.
   - **[Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/)**: A paid tool for advanced annotation workflows.

2. Define **entities** to extract:
   - `CONTRADICTION`: Phrases describing trade-offs (e.g., "increasing accuracy reduces speed").
   - `RESOLUTION`: Text proposing solutions (e.g., "introducing lightweight models resolves the trade-off").
   - `PRINCIPLE`: References to TRIZ principles, if applicable (e.g., segmentation, dynamization).

3. Annotation Example:
   For the text:  
   > "To address the trade-off between speed and accuracy, we propose a lightweight detection model."
   - `CONTRADICTION`: "trade-off between speed and accuracy"
   - `RESOLUTION`: "lightweight detection model"

4. Export Data:
   - Export annotations in JSON, CSV, or spaCy-compatible formats.

---

#### **Classification Task (Categorize by TRIZ Principles or Innovation Levels)**
1. Define **classes**:
   - **TRIZ Principles**: Segmentation, Dynamization, Ideality, etc.
   - **Innovation Levels**: Routine, Minor Improvements, Breakthroughs.

2. Annotate Patents:
   - Assign labels to each patent manually or semi-automatically using domain knowledge.
   - Example for a cybersecurity patent:
     - **Class**: "Segmentation" (e.g., dividing network traffic into manageable chunks).

3. Data Format:
   - Prepare a CSV file:
     ```csv
     text,label
     "This patent addresses real-time threat detection by segmenting network traffic.",Segmentation
     "The invention balances speed and accuracy with lightweight AI models.",Tradeoff Resolution
     ```

---

#### **Summarization Task (Generate Abstracts or Claims Summaries)**
1. Create Pairs:
   - Use full patent descriptions as input and manually write concise summaries as output.
   - Example:
     - **Input**: Full claims text.
     - **Output**: "This invention proposes a real-time lightweight model for detecting network anomalies."

2. Data Format:
   - Save as JSON or CSV:
     ```json
     {"input": "Full claims text here.", "summary": "Short summary here."}
     ```

---

### **4. Tools for Data Preparation**
1. **Cleaning the Data**:
   - Use Python libraries to clean and preprocess text:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     import re

     def clean_text(text):
         text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)  # Remove extra spaces
         text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)  # Remove special characters
         return text.lower()

     data['cleaned_text'] = data['raw_text'].apply(clean_text)
     data.to_csv('cleaned_data.csv', index=False)
     ```

2. **Splitting the Dataset**:
   - Split into training, validation, and testing sets:
     ```python
     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

     train, test = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
     ```

---

### **5. Fine-Tune the Model**
Once the labeled data is ready:
- Use a framework like **Hugging Face Transformers** to fine-tune the model for the desired task.

#### Example for NER Fine-Tuning:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-cased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=3)  # 3 for CONTRADICTION, RESOLUTION, PRINCIPLE

# Prepare training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=3,
)

# Fine-tune the model
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,  # Prepared earlier
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)
trainer.train()
```

---

### **6. Evaluate the Model**
- Use labeled test data to evaluate:
  - **NER**: Metrics like F1-score and accuracy.
  - **Classification**: Metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy.
  - **Summarization**: Metrics like ROUGE.

---

### **7. Deploy and Iterate**
- Deploy the fine-tuned model for automated patent analysis.
- Continuously refine annotations and retrain the model with updated data.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. Set up an annotation pipeline using tools like **Label Studio**.
2. Annotate a small batch of patents for a pilot test.
3. Fine-tune an initial model and validate its performance.

The examples provided earlier are not using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**; they are based on **supervised learning** techniques, which are better suited for tasks like **named entity recognition (NER)**, **classification**, and **summarization** because they rely on labeled datasets. However, **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** can be applied in specific parts of this project, especially where decision-making and optimization are involved. Here's a breakdown:

---

### **How Reinforcement Learning Could Fit in This Project**

#### **1. Patent Classification and Trend Prediction**
- **Scenario**: Suppose you want to classify patents into TRIZ principles or innovation levels but lack labeled data for supervised learning.
- **How RL Helps**:
  - Use RL to reward the model for accurately predicting classes based on patterns it discovers in unlabeled data.
  - The model learns through trial and error by exploring and being rewarded for correct classification.

#### **2. Contradiction Resolution Discovery**
- **Scenario**: Identifying resolutions to contradictions in patent claims involves evaluating various approaches to resolving trade-offs (e.g., speed vs. accuracy).
- **How RL Helps**:
  - Train an RL agent to propose solutions based on past patents.
  - Reward the agent for generating solutions that align with TRIZ principles or successfully resolve the identified contradiction.

#### **3. Summarization Optimization**
- **Scenario**: Creating concise and meaningful summaries of patent text can involve trade-offs between brevity and comprehensiveness.
- **How RL Helps**:
  - Use RL to optimize the balance between concise and informative summaries.
  - Define a reward function based on metrics like ROUGE or human feedback on summary quality.

#### **4. Ideal Final Result (IFR) Simulation**
- **Scenario**: TRIZ aims to find the **Ideal Final Result**, where the problem is resolved with minimal resources or complexity.
- **How RL Helps**:
  - Train an agent to simulate the process of reaching an ideal solution based on previous examples.
  - Reward the agent for minimizing complexity while maximizing the effectiveness of the resolution.

---

### **Reinforcement Learning Framework for This Project**

#### **RL Components**
1. **Environment**:
   - The dataset of patents (text data, contradictions, resolutions).
   - The TRIZ principles or metrics that guide decision-making.

2. **Agent**:
   - A model that takes actions (e.g., classifying patents, proposing resolutions) based on the environment.

3. **Actions**:
   - Predicting contradictions or TRIZ principles.
   - Proposing resolutions to contradictions.
   - Generating summaries.

4. **Rewards**:
   - Correctly identifying contradictions or classifications.
   - Proposing resolutions that align with TRIZ principles.
   - Generating summaries with high ROUGE or human evaluation scores.

#### **RL Techniques**
- **Policy-Based Methods**:
  - Use methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train the agent.
- **Reward Shaping**:
  - Design reward functions that reflect the quality of outputs (e.g., relevance to TRIZ principles, correctness of resolutions).
- **Model-Based RL**:
  - Use a pre-trained model (like GPT or BERT) as the base and fine-tune it with RL for specific tasks.

---

### **Example RL Workflow for Summarization**

1. **Define Environment**:
   - Patent text as the input.
   - A reward function based on summary quality (e.g., ROUGE score).

2. **Train the Agent**:
   - Use an RL library like OpenAI's `stable-baselines` or Hugging Face's `transformers` with RL capabilities.

   Example pseudocode:
   ```python
   from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelWithLMHead
   from stable_baselines3 import PPO

   # Load pre-trained model
   model_name = "gpt-3"  # Example model
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
   model = AutoModelWithLMHead.from_pretrained(model_name)

   # Define reward function (e.g., based on ROUGE score)
   def reward_function(predicted_summary, ground_truth_summary):
       return compute_rouge(predicted_summary, ground_truth_summary)

   # Train RL agent
   agent = PPO("MlpPolicy", model, verbose=1)
   agent.learn(total_timesteps=10000)
   ```

3. **Evaluate Results**:
   - Test the RL-trained model on unseen patent text and compare its performance to supervised models.

---

### **Challenges with RL in This Context**
1. **Reward Design**:
   - Designing appropriate reward functions for complex tasks (e.g., contradiction resolution) can be non-trivial.
   
2. **Computational Resources**:
   - RL often requires significant computation due to the trial-and-error learning process.

3. **Data Requirements**:
   - RL typically benefits from environments with clear objectives and feedback, which may be harder to define in text-based tasks.

---

### **When to Use RL vs. Supervised Learning**
- **Use RL**:
  - When labeled data is scarce or expensive to generate.
  - When the problem involves dynamic decision-making or optimization (e.g., finding IFRs, generating resolutions).
- **Use Supervised Learning**:
  - When labeled data is available, and tasks involve straightforward classification, extraction, or summarization.

---

### **Conclusion**
While the provided examples use **supervised learning**, reinforcement learning can complement or even replace parts of the workflow where dynamic exploration, optimization, or creative resolution is needed. If you’d like, I can help design a specific RL-based solution for one of the tasks in your project.
