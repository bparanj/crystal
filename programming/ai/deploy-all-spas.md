Here’s a high-level way to organize 50 separate React single-page apps (SPAs) under one “home page” that lists links to each app:

1. **Directory Structure**  
   - Have a main repository (or folder) called something like `apps-portal`.  
   - Inside it, create subfolders for each of the 50 React apps (e.g., `app1`, `app2`, … `app50`).  
   - Each subfolder is a standalone React project with its own `package.json`, build process, etc.

2. **Home Page (the “Portal” App)**  
   - Create a small React (or simple HTML/JS) project called `portal`. This is your landing page.  
   - In `portal`, list all 50 apps as links. Each link should point to where its corresponding app is hosted or served.  
   - For instance, if you deploy each app to a unique route or subdomain, your links might be:  
     - `https://example.com/app1`  
     - `https://example.com/app2`  
     - …  
     - `https://example.com/app50`

3. **How to Serve Each App**  
   - **Option A: Subfolders**  
     - Build each React app in its own subfolder. For example, when you run a production build, each app’s output (say `build` or `dist` folder) is placed at `public/app1/`, `public/app2/`, etc.  
     - Your server (or hosting service) can serve `portal` as `index.html` at the root, and each app at `/app1/`, `/app2/`, etc. 

4. **Routing Within Each SPA**  
   - Each React app remains a standalone SPA with its own internal routes.  
   - From the portal’s perspective, you only need simple, static links that point to each app’s root URL.

5. **User Experience**  
   - A user visits `example.com` (the portal).  
   - They see a list (or grid) of links to the 50 apps.  
   - Clicking on a link navigates the user to that specific app.  
   - The user can bookmark or share direct links to any app.  
   - They can also return to the portal homepage if you include a “Back to Portal” link within each app.

6. **Development Approach**  
   - If each SPA is truly separate, each has its own build system, dependencies, and version control.  
   - The `portal` code can be very minimal—just enough to render a page with 50 links.  
   - Whenever you update an individual app, you redeploy just that app and update the link if the URL changes.

7. **Optional Enhancements**  
   - Use a design system or shared components in each of the 50 apps to maintain consistency.  
   - Provide basic metadata (description, thumbnail, etc.) in the portal for each app.  
   - If some apps are related, group them under subheadings on the portal.  

You’ll have one lightweight “portal” page that simply links out to your 50 standalone React SPAs. Each SPA lives in its own folder (or even its own repo). You deploy them under subpaths or subdomains, and the portal’s job is just to help users navigate to each app.


Below is a high-level strategy to ensure each SPA’s build artifacts end up in the correct directory so they can be served under the right path (e.g., `/app1`, `/app2`, etc.). Exact details depend on your build tools (Create React App, Vite, Webpack, etc.), but the core ideas remain the same:

---

## 1. Distinguish Each App and Its Target Directory

1. **Directory Names / App Paths**  
   - Decide on a structure, for example:
     - `/public/app1/`
     - `/public/app2/`
     - …
     - `/public/app50/`
   - These will be the final locations where your production artifacts should live.

2. **App Configuration**  
   - In each app’s build config (e.g., in `package.json` or in your build tool’s config), set the `output` or `build` directory to the correct location. 
   - For instance, you might configure App1 to place its artifacts directly into `../public/app1` when you run `npm run build`.

### Example (Using Create React App)
- **`package.json`** in `app1`:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "app1",
    "homepage": "/app1",
    "scripts": {
      "build": "react-scripts build"
    },
    "dependencies": {
      // ...
    }
  }
  ```
- **Serve or copy** the build output into `/public/app1` in your main repository. 
  - By default, Create React App places compiled files in `app1/build/`. You can write a small script or use a CI/CD step to move the contents of `app1/build` to `public/app1/`.

### Example (Using Vite)
- **`vite.config.js`** in `app1`:
  ```js
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
  import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [react()],
    base: '/app1/', // Ensures correct asset paths
    build: {
      outDir: '../public/app1' // Place build artifacts here
    }
  })
  ```

This way, when you run `npm run build` in `app1`, Vite puts everything in `../public/app1`.

---

## 2. Automated Scripts or CI/CD

- **Automation**: Use a script (e.g., a root-level bash or Node script) that loops through each app’s folder, runs `npm run build`, and copies/moves the results to the correct directory.
- **Continuous Integration**: In a CI pipeline, you might:
  1. Check out the repo.
  2. For each app, install dependencies and build.
  3. Move the build output to the designated folder (`public/appX/`).
  4. Deploy or serve the entire `public` folder.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

apps=("app1" "app2" "app3" ... "app50")

for app in "${apps[@]}"
do
  echo "Building $app"
  cd $app
  npm install
  npm run build
  cd ..
  # Move/copy artifacts to the main public directory
  cp -R "$app/build/." "public/$app/"
done
```

This script is just an example—adjust paths for your toolchain.

---

## 3. Serving the Apps

Once each app’s build artifacts are in, for example, `/public/app1`, `/public/app2`, etc.:

- **If using a simple Node/Express server**: Serve the `public` folder statically, so your domain has:
  - `http://example.com/app1/`
  - `http://example.com/app2/`
  - …
- **If using a host like Netlify**: You can set up rewrite rules or subfolder deployments. 
- **If using a single-page server**: Each React app needs correct “fallback” routing. Usually, if you set the `homepage` or `base` config properly, it handles relative paths and subfolder references (for scripts, CSS, etc.).

---

## 4. Home Page Portal

- **Portal Approach**: Keep a simple `index.html` (or small React app) in `public/` that lists links to each subfolder. 
- Each link might look like:
  ```html
  <a href="/app1/">App 1</a>
  <a href="/app2/">App 2</a>
  <!-- … -->
  ```
- Users land on `http://example.com/` (the portal), see 50 links, and click to go to each app’s separate SPA.

---


1. **Separate Build Outputs**: Configure each React app to produce its own build artifacts in a unique subfolder (e.g., `/public/appX`).  
2. **Consistent Paths**: Use “base” or “homepage” settings so that the compiled assets reference the correct subpaths (important for correct routing and asset fetching).  
3. **Deployment Script**: Automate the build-and-copy steps so that each app ends up in the right place without manual mistakes.  
4. **Portal**: A minimal page with links to each subfolder ties it all together.



This ensures every SPA is compiled on its own, and the final static files end up in the correct directories to be served.

   - **Option B: Subdomains**  
     - Build and host each React app on a subdomain: `app1.example.com`, `app2.example.com`, etc.  
     - The main `portal` (say `portal.example.com` or just `example.com`) contains links to these subdomains.  
   - **Option C: Multiple Deployments**  
     - If you use a service like Netlify or Vercel, you can deploy each app to a unique URL.  
     - The portal’s code simply has a list of links to these separate deployments.
