Checklist of questions that, when answered YES, indicate that RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI would be the right choice for your application.

- Do you have or can you create a specialized knowledge base or domain-specific information that isn't readily available in the LLM's training data?

- Is the accuracy and factuality of responses critical for your application? 

-  Do you need to provide up-to-date or real-time information beyond the LLM's training cutoff date?

-  Do you need to control and verify the sources of information the AI uses?

-  Would your application benefit from combining the broad knowledge of an LLM with specific, curated information?

-  Is it important to reduce hallucinations and maintain consistency in the AI's responses?

-  Does your application domain involve frequently changing information that needs regular updates?

-  Would your users benefit from responses that incorporate both general knowledge and specific, trusted content?

-  Is it important to have transparency and traceability in how the AI generates its responses?
-  Do you need to provide source citations or references for the information in responses?
-  Do you need to ensure compliance with specific guidelines or regulations in your responses?
-  Is it important to have control over the context that influences the AI's responses?

If most of these questions are answered with YES, then RAG would likely be the right architectural choice for your application, as it would provide the control, accuracy, and flexibility needed for your use case.

-  Do you need to incorporate up-to-date or domain-specific knowledge that the base model does not possess?  
-  Do you have a repository of text or documents that your application should reference at query time?  
-  Do you need to ensure the model’s answers are grounded in factual information drawn from a known set of sources?  
-  Do you want to reduce hallucinations by letting the model “look up” relevant information as it generates answers?  
-  Do you want to dynamically update or add new data to the knowledge base without retraining or fine-tuning a large model?  
-  Is it important that your application can control and verify the sources of information returned?
