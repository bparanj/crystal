Structure Elements:
1. Title with "===" underline
2. Opening statement - single clear sentence
3. Three-beat rhythm pattern:
   - Short declarative 
   - Short declarative
   - Longer analytical expansion

Paragraph Construction:
```
[Foundation Statement]
[2-3 Sharp, short sentences]
[Expansive analysis sentence]
[Connection to broader context]
```

Stylistic Devices:
- Dashes for layered meaning: [core point] - [elaboration] - [deeper insight]
- Paragraph hierarchy: ground → build → expand
- Term repetition cycle: introduce → revisit → deepen
- Closing with open-ended implications

Sentence Patterns:
```
Type A: [Subject] [verb] [direct object].
Type B: [Short point]. [Short point]. [Short point].
Type C: [Initial thought], [expansion], [broader meaning].
```

Structural Flow:
1. Plant the core concept
2. Build in measured steps
3. Layer additional meaning
4. Connect to larger implications
5. Open new doors of thought

Prompting Framework:
```
Write about [topic] using:
1. Clear statement openings
2. Short-short-long sentence rhythm
3. Dash-separated elaborations
4. Building block paragraphs
5. Implication-based endings
```

Transitional Elements:
- From foundation to analysis
- From specific to general
- From observation to implication
- From detail to pattern

Writing Style Template
===

Core Format:
"Write in a style that uses:
1. Clear, single-sentence openings
2. Short declarative statements followed by analysis
3. Dashes for layered meaning
4. Building-block paragraphs that expand ideas
5. Endings that suggest implications rather than conclude"

Example Prompt:
"Explain [topic] using clear opening statements, short-to-long sentence patterns, and dash-based elaborations. Build each paragraph from foundation to implication."

Alternative Short Version:
"Write about [topic] with precise, building statements. Use short declaratives followed by analysis. Add depth through dash-separated insights. End with implications."

## Alternative

Eric Evans’ writing style in *Domain-Driven Design* is precise, methodical, and grounded in practical problem-solving. He focuses on clear definitions, establishing a shared vocabulary, and systematically addressing complex topics through abstraction. 

1. **Introduce the Context and Problem:** Start by identifying the domain and its core challenges. Frame the problem in a way that aligns with the reader’s goals.
2. **Define Concepts Clearly:** Introduce key terms and ensure they are well-defined, avoiding ambiguity.
3. **Structure Ideas Logically:** Break down the topic into clear sections, with each section building on the previous one.
4. **Use Examples to Anchor Ideas:** Provide simple, relatable examples to explain abstract concepts.
5. **Focus on the Reader's Perspective:** Address how the concept helps solve real-world problems in the domain.
6. **Iterative Complexity:** Begin with foundational ideas and layer complexity progressively, reinforcing earlier points.

### **Prompt Template**

---

**Context**  
Clearly define the subject being addressed. Frame the problem that needs solving in a way that aligns with the reader's goals. Ensure the context sets up a shared understanding of the issue.

**Problem Statement**  
Identify the core challenge. State it explicitly, ensuring the problem is relatable and concrete.

**Key Definitions**  
Define the essential terms or concepts that will be used throughout the explanation. Provide clear, concise definitions to avoid ambiguity.

**Structure of the Explanation**  
Break the response into logical sections:
1. **Foundation:** Introduce the foundational idea or principle.
2. **Progressive Development:** Build on the foundation, adding complexity or detail as needed.
3. **Resolution:** Conclude by connecting the explanation to solving the original problem.

**Examples**  
Provide practical, relatable examples to anchor abstract concepts. These examples should clarify the idea in real-world terms.

**Outcome and Relevance**  
Explain how the solution or concept applies to solving the stated problem. Highlight the value it brings to the domain.

### Example Prompt Using the Template

**Context:** Describe a real-world domain, such as designing robust APIs for a banking system.  
**Problem Statement:** Explain why maintaining backward compatibility is critical.  
**Key Definitions:** Terms like "backward compatibility," "API consumers," and "versioning."  
**Expected Structure:** Start with what backward compatibility is, provide strategies for maintaining it, then discuss how these strategies solve real-world issues for API consumers.  
**Examples:** Include a scenario where breaking backward compatibility caused downstream issues.  
**Outcome and Relevance:** Show how applying the concept benefits developers and end-users alike.  

When responding:

1. Ground the answer in the provided **context** and **problem statement.**  
2. Incorporate **key definitions** to establish a shared understanding.  
3. Use a **structured explanation** that builds progressively.  
4. Anchor abstract ideas with **examples.**  
5. Conclude by tying the explanation back to its **outcome and relevance.**  

This template ensures clarity, depth, and practical utility in responses.
