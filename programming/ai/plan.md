Understand models such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly
detection. 

Understand the core concepts behind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization,
optimization algorithms, and error analysis.

Deep learning: 

Basics of neural networks, practical skills for making them work (such as hyperparameter tuning), convolutional networks,
sequence models, and transformers.

Math relevant to machine learning: 

Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, and various manipulations of them) as well as probability and statistics (including discrete and continuous probability, standard probability distributions, basic rules such as independence and Bayes’ rule, and hypothesis testing). 

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) — using visualizations and other methods to systematically explore a dataset. 

EDA 
useful in data-centric AI development, where analyzing errors and gaining insights can
drive progress 

Understanding of calculus will help

TensorFlow or PyTorch, and scikit-learn
