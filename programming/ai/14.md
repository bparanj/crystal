The first major success of data-driven AI is often attributed to the development and application of machine learning algorithms to practical problems where traditional programming approaches were insufficient. A landmark achievement occurred in the field of speech recognition.

### IBM's Speech Recognition Milestone in the 1990s

In the early 1990s, IBM's research on speech recognition marked a significant success in data-driven AI. The project shifted focus from rule-based methods to statistical models for speech recognition. The system could recognize continuous human speech with relatively high accuracy for the time. This system, showcased in the early 1990s, was one of the first examples of applying data-driven methods (specifically, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and later neural networks) to a complex AI problem.

### Significance

- **Data Over Rules**: This approach emphasized the power of data in teaching machines how to perform tasks, marking a departure from the rule-based systems that dominated AI research until then.
- **Foundation for Modern AI**: The success of IBM's speech recognition project helped establish the viability and potential of machine learning, laying the groundwork for the deep learning revolution that would emerge in the following decades.
- **Practical Applications**: This milestone demonstrated that data-driven AI could solve real-world problems, leading to the development of commercial speech recognition technologies and influencing countless other applications of machine learning.

The achievements in speech recognition were a precursor to the broader adoption of data-driven approaches across AI disciplines, computer vision, natural language processing, and beyond, highlighting the transition towards the machine learning-dominated era of artificial intelligence.
