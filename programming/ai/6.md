Imagine you're trying to guess whether it's going to rain today. Initially, you might think there's a 50% chance of rain based on the typical weather patterns for the season—this is your starting point or "prior."

Now, you look outside in the morning and notice that the sky is very cloudy. This new information is your "evidence."

Using Bayesian inference, you update your initial guess based on this new evidence. If cloudy skies in your area have historically been associated with rain 80% of the time, you adjust your belief to reflect a higher probability of rain today—this adjusted belief is your "posterior" probability.

Bayesian inference allows you to start with an initial belief about the likelihood of an event (it raining), incorporate new evidence (cloudy skies), and update your belief to better reflect the reality, thus improving your prediction based on the accumulation of evidence.

Using the example of predicting rain, here’s how Bayesian inference works step by step:

### Step 1: Establish the Prior

This is your initial belief about the probability of it raining today before seeing the current day's weather. Suppose based on historical data for this time of year, you estimate there's a 50% chance of rain. This 50% is your "prior" probability.

### Step 2: Collect Evidence

You observe the weather in the morning and notice that the sky is very cloudy. This observation is your evidence. From weather statistics, you know that when the sky is this cloudy, there's an 80% chance of rain during the day.

### Step 3: Update Your Belief (Calculate the Posterior)

Now, you integrate your prior belief (50% chance of rain) with your new evidence (cloudy skies leading to an 80% chance of rain). Using Bayesian inference, you calculate the "posterior" probability, which is your updated belief about the likelihood of rain given the cloudy skies.

This calculation considers:
- How likely you are to see these cloudy skies if it were going to rain (the likelihood).
- How common cloudy skies are in general, regardless of whether it rains (the evidence's overall probability).

If, for instance, cloudy skies in the morning make it significantly more likely to rain than your original estimate, your posterior probability might increase to, say, 70%, reflecting a higher confidence in rain based on the evidence of cloudy skies.

The posterior becomes your new updated belief about the chance of rain today, refined by the specific evidence you've observed.
