Performing Exploratory Data Analysis using PCA

Let's break down how you perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

**Why Use PCA for EDA?**

* **Curse of Dimensionality:** When you have many features (columns) in your dataset, directly visualizing and understanding trends becomes extremely difficult. 
* **Hidden Relationships:** PCA reveals the most important directions of variation in your data, helping uncover combinations of features that strongly drive patterns.
* **Simplified Exploration:** Projects your high-dimensional data onto a few key components, letting you analyze it more easily.

**Step-by-Step Guide to PCA in EDA**

1. **Data Preparation:**
   * **Handle Missing Values:** Decide how to fill or remove rows with missing entries as these can bias PCA.
   * **Normalization/Scaling:** If features have vastly different scales (one in centimeters, another in millions of dollars), consider rescaling them. This often improves PCA performance.

2. **Perform PCA**
    * **Calculating Components:** PCA is essentially an eigenvector decomposition. Thankfully, statistical packages (Python’s Scikit-learn, R, etc.) make this a one-line command. 
    * **Choosing Components:** You'll output several principal components (PCs), ranked by how much variance in the data they explain. Usually, the first few capture most of the information.

3. **Visualization**
    * **Scatter Plots:** Project your data onto the top 2 or 3 PCs. For example, plot using PC1 on the x-axis and PC2 on the y-axis. Look for:
        * Clusters: Separate groups may indicate naturally existing classifications within your data.
        * Outliers: Points far from the majority need investigation –  data errors or interesting cases?

4. **Feature Importance**
    * **Examining Loadings:**  Each PC is like a  'recipe' combining your original features.  Loadings tell you how much each original feature contributes to it.
    * **Identifying Drivers:** Features with high loadings on the most important PCs strongly influence the patterns in your data.

5. **Interpretation (This is Key!)**
    * **Don't Blindly Trust Math:** Remember PCs might be linear combinations of original features that  lack simple real-world meaning. Domain knowledge is vital to interpret results.
    * **Tie Back to Goals:** Look at what groups emerge or insights gleaned through the lens of your initial questions about the data.

**PCA Limitations**

* **Linear Approach:**  It focuses on linear relationships. If your data has complex non-linear patterns, PCA might obscure them. Non-linear methods (t-SNE, UMAP) can be better choices in those cases.
* **Interpretability:** Sometimes, PC1 and PC2 may not themselves have any easily understood practical meaning. 

**Example**

Imagine PCA on a dataset of houses, with features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. 

* PC1 might heavily favor size-related features (area, bedrooms), capturing variation between small vs. large homes.
* PC2 might  focus on room ratios and luxury indicators (bathrooms, kitchen upgrades), distinguishing practical family homes from luxury condos.

**Practice**

* **Tools:** Code example of performing PCA in Python (Scikit-learn) or R
* **Dataset Time:** Do you have a dataset in mind or want to use a standard one (like the classic Iris flower dataset) to try this out? 

Discuss how to handle non-numeric features, or interpret results more deeply.

## Implementation

Use a standard dataset to write a program that demonstrates how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis using PCA

Python example using the popular Iris dataset. This example shows how to load the data, perform basic exploratory analysis, apply PCA, and visualize the transformed data.

**Steps:**

1. Load the dataset.
2. Examine basic statistics (mean, std, distribution).
3. Perform PCA to reduce dimensionality and understand variance explained.
4. Visualize results in the reduced dimension space.

**Code Example:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Load the dataset
iris = load_iris()
df = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
df['target'] = iris.target

# Basic exploratory analysis
print(df.describe())      # Summary statistics
print(df['target'].value_counts())  # Distribution of classes

# Pairplot to visualize relationships
sns.pairplot(df, hue='target', vars=iris.feature_names)
plt.show()

# Standardize the data for PCA
X = df[iris.feature_names]
X_scaled = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)

# Perform PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)

# Check how much variance is explained by each principal component
print("Explained variance ratio:", pca.explained_variance_ratio_)

# Create a DataFrame with the PCA components
pca_df = pd.DataFrame(data=X_pca, columns=['PC1', 'PC2'])
pca_df['target'] = df['target']

# Visualize the data in the new PCA space
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.scatterplot(x='PC1', y='PC2', hue='target', data=pca_df, palette='Set1')
plt.title('PCA projection of Iris dataset')
plt.show()
```

**Insights:**
- PCA helps reduce dimensions while keeping most of the variation in the data.
- The explained variance ratio shows which components capture the most information.
- Visualizing the PCA-transformed data can reveal class separability and potential patterns not easily visible in higher dimensions.
