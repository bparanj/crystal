The S-curve concept in TRIZ represents the lifecycle of a technology or product, from its initial development, through rapid improvement and growth, to maturity and eventual decline as it reaches its inherent limits. In the context of artificial intelligence (AI), identifying distinct S-curves can be challenging due to the field's complexity and continuous evolution. However, we can approximate the major phases of AI development as distinct S-curves based on technological breakthroughs and periods of intense growth, stabilization, and renewed innovation. 

As of my last update, AI has experienced several notable S-curves, each characterized by foundational advancements and shifts in focus:

1. **Early Foundations and Rule-based AI (1950s - 1970s)**: The initial excitement around AI, with the development of basic neural networks, rule-based systems (like expert systems), and the conceptual groundwork laid by researchers.

2. **The Emergence of Machine Learning (1980s - 1990s)**: A shift towards machine learning algorithms, where the focus moved from hard-coded knowledge to systems that could learn from data, although progress was initially slow.

3. **The Rise of Deep Learning and Big Data (2000s - Present)**: A significant S-curve initiated by breakthroughs in deep learning and the availability of big data and powerful computing resources. This period has seen rapid advancements in natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning, marking a profound expansion in AI capabilities and applications.

Each of these S-curves reflects a period of technological infancy, rapid growth and adoption, and eventual maturation. Currently, AI is still in a phase of rapid development and innovation, particularly within the realm of deep learning and its applications. The field may be approaching or already entering a new S-curve with the emergence of technologies like generative AI, advanced reinforcement learning, and the integration of AI across diverse sectors.

Predicting future S-curves in AI involves considering potential technological breakthroughs, limitations of current approaches, and emerging challenges that new AI technologies might address. Given AI's broad impact and ongoing research, it's likely that AI will experience additional S-curves as researchers and practitioners push the boundaries of what's possible with artificial intelligence.

Breaking down the period from the 2000s to the present into 10-year periods allows us to observe more granular phases within the ongoing AI S-curve, particularly focusing on the rise of deep learning and its implications:
