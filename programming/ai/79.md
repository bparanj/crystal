**Concept of Temporal Data**

* **The Timestamp Factor:** Temporal data is any data where time plays a crucial role. Think of sensor readings, stock prices, website traffic logs –  they all come with timestamps.
* **Ordering Matters:** Unlike regular data where you might shuffle rows without major consequence, order is vital in temporal data. Analyzing it properly means respecting that order. 
* **Hidden Time-Based Patterns:** Often, the most valuable insights in temporal data are about changes over time. Are sales numbers trending up or down? Do website errors spike at particular hours? These are things regular data analysis tools wouldn't be ideal for.

**Temporal Data vs. Structured and Unstructured Data**

* **Structured Data (Easy for Databases):**  Neat rows and columns, like a customer information spreadsheet. Each entry is independent of the others.
* **Unstructured Data (More Messy):** Things like images, videos, raw text. There's no inherent 'table' structure to them.
* **Temporal Data (Can be both):** You can have very structured temporal data (stock ticker symbol, timestamp, price) or unstructured temporal data (a series of security camera images, each with a timestamp). The key is the time component!

**Time Series Forecasting**

* **Peeking into the Future:** It's like weather forecasting, but for  trends in your data. Trying to predict the next sales figure, future website traffic, or the expected temperature at 2 PM tomorrow.
* **Why Programmers Like It:**  It heavily involves algorithms and looking for patterns in sequences, things programmers are comfortable with.

**Preprocessing for Stationarity**

* **Stationarity: What & Why:** A stationary time series means its basic statistical properties (mean, variance) don't change much over time. Forecasting models love stationarity; it means the patterns they pick up are likely to continue.
* **Making Data Behave:** Real-world data is rarely  stationary.  Here's what helps:
    * **Differencing:**  Instead of looking at raw values (say, total sales), you analyze the change between time periods (how much sales increased or decreased week-over-week).
    * **Detrending:** Removing overall upward or downward trends. Makes data 'flatter' for analysis.   
    * **Log Transformations:** If your data has huge swings, taking a log helps compress the scale, making stationarity easier to achieve.

**Analogy for Programmers:** 

Think of stationarity as trying to fit a nice function or  line through a  scatterplot for making predictions. It's much easier to fit a line to a nicely clustered cloud of points, rather than data going wildly up and down. Preprocessing for stationarity makes the plot nicer!

Write Python code to demonstrate how to achieve stationarity

Below is an example Python code snippet that demonstrates how to check for stationarity in a time series and how to apply transformations (like differencing) to achieve stationarity. For context, a stationary time series has statistical properties (mean, variance) that do not change over time. Non-stationary series often exhibit trends or changing variance, making forecasting more challenging.

**Steps:**

1. Generate a synthetic time series that is non-stationary (e.g., a random walk).
2. Perform a stationarity test, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, to verify non-stationarity.
3. Apply differencing (subtracting the previous observation from the current one) to remove trends and achieve stationarity.
4. Re-run the ADF test to confirm that the differenced series is now stationary.

**Code**

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

# 1. Generate a non-stationary time series (a simple random walk)
np.random.seed(42)
n = 200
# Random noise
noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, n)
# Cumulative sum to produce a random walk
time_series = np.cumsum(noise) + 10  # added a constant for clarity
dates = pd.date_range('2020-01-01', periods=n, freq='D')
df = pd.DataFrame(time_series, index=dates, columns=['value'])

# Function to perform ADF test and print results
def adf_test(series, title=''):
    print(f'Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test: {title}')
    result = adfuller(series.dropna(), autolag='AIC')
    labels = ['ADF Statistic', 'p-value', '# Lags Used', '# Observations Used']
    out = pd.Series(result[0:4], index=labels)
    for key, val in result[4].items():
        out[f'Critical Value ({key})'] = val
    print(out)
    if result[1] <= 0.05:
        print("=> The series is likely stationary.")
    else:
        print("=> The series is likely non-stationary.\n")

# 2. Check stationarity of the original time series
adf_test(df['value'], 'Original Series')

# Plot the original series
plt.figure(figsize=(10,4))
plt.plot(df['value'], label='Original Series')
plt.title('Non-Stationary Time Series (Random Walk)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# 3. Apply differencing to achieve stationarity
# First difference
df['value_diff'] = df['value'].diff()

# Check stationarity of the differenced series
adf_test(df['value_diff'], '1st Differenced Series')

# Plot the differenced series
plt.figure(figsize=(10,4))
plt.plot(df['value_diff'], label='1st Differenced Series', color='orange')
plt.title('Stationary Time Series (After Differencing)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

**What This Code Does:**
- Creates a random walk, which is typically non-stationary.
- Uses the ADF test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) to confirm that the original series is non-stationary.
- Applies a first difference transformation: `X_t - X_{t-1}`, which often removes trends and makes the series stationary.
- Re-runs the ADF test on the differenced series, confirming that it is now likely stationary.

**Adjustments:**
- Try second differencing if the first difference does not achieve stationarity.
- Experiment with other transformations like logarithms or de-trending if differencing alone isn't sufficient.  
- Use real-world data (e.g., stock prices) and apply the same steps to stabilize variance and remove trends.

Create a video for stationarity

Python code example that creates a video to conceptually demonstrate the idea of stationarity in time series. 

1. Generate a non-stationary time series (a random walk) frame by frame.
2. Simultaneously generate its first-differenced version.
3. In each frame of the animation:
   - Update the original and differenced series with a new data point.
   - Show how the rolling mean and rolling variance of the original and differenced series evolve.
   - Illustrate visually that the original series’ mean and variance change over time (non-stationary), while the differenced series exhibits a more stable mean and variance (stationary).

- This code uses `matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation` to create an MP4 video.
- Requires `ffmpeg` to be installed.
- While this is a conceptual demonstration, it gives an intuitive sense of how differencing helps achieve stationarity.

**Code Example (run locally):**

```python

# Create a random walk (non-stationary)
data = np.cumsum(increments) + 10  # starting around 10 for clarity
dates = pd.date_range('2020-01-01', periods=N, freq='D')

# We'll also compute the differenced series
# But for the animation, we'll reveal them point by point

# Parameters for rolling calculations

anim = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=N, init_func=init, blit=False, repeat=False)

# Save the animation as MP4 (requires ffmpeg)
anim.save('stationarity_demo.mp4', writer='ffmpeg', fps=10)

plt.show()
```

**What This Code Does:**

- Simulates a random walk (non-stationary series) and computes its differenced version (stationary series).
- Each frame of the animation:
  - Adds a new data point to both series.
  - Updates rolling mean and variance lines on separate subplots.
- Over time, you see the random walk’s rolling mean and variance drifting, showing non-stationarity.
- For the differenced series, the rolling mean and variance stabilize, illustrating that differencing helps achieve stationarity.

**Adjustments:**

- Change the window size for rolling calculations.
- Experiment with different noise levels or other transformations (like logging) before differencing.
- Use a real-world dataset to see how differencing might achieve stationarity.
