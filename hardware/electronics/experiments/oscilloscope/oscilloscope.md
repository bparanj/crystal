Observe the Behavior of an AC Signal with an Oscilloscope

To visualize an AC signal and understand its positive and negative cycles.

Change the function generator settings: function: sine, frequency: 1 kHz, amplitude: 15 volts
Connect the function generator directly to an oscilloscope.

Procedure:

Observe how the AC signal oscillates between positive and negative voltages.
Familiarize yourself with the waveâ€™s movement above and below the horizontal axis (zero line).

This shows the alternating nature of AC signals.

Occilloscope is an electronic test equipment for measuring input and output signals.

The positive lead is connected to the positive terminal of the device to measure and the negative lead to the ground.

You can adjust the time per division to view the wafeform. How to calculate the value for time per division?

Function generator is an electronic device used to generate various voltage waveforms. There are three different waveforms available in the settings window: square, sine and triangle.

The amplitude is the peak voltage of the waveform, which determines its height from the center line (or baseline) to its peak. It is displayed in volts. The frequency is displayed in hertz. The DC offset is the amount by which the waveform is shifted vertically from the zero-voltage baseline, effectively adding a constant voltage to the signal.

Connect the positive lead to the positive terminal on the device to send the signal and connect the negative terminal to ground.

In the settings, we can edit its name, frequency, amplitude, DC offset and function wave shape.

Steps

Step 1

Take a function generator.

Step 2

Take an oscilloscope.

Image 12

Step 3

Connect the oscilloscope to the function generator.

Step 4

Set the function generator frequency to 100 Hz, amplitude to 5 volt, DC offset to 0 and function to sine.

Step 5

Set the oscilloscope time per division to 10 ms.

How to calculate the time per division?

Step 6

Run the simulation. DC offset 0 leads to a waveform that is equal in amplitude on the positive and negative cycles of the sine wave. It alternates from +5 volts and -5 volts. At 100 Hz we have many cycles in the oscilloscope.

Step 7

Reduce the frequency to 16.7 Hz. This results is a sine wave that has two highs and two lows. The number of sine waves has reduced.

Step 8

Increase the DC offset to 2.77 volts in the function generator. The wave form shifts up and stays over the horizontal line. The sine wave is no longer swinging over the horizontal line equally.

Step 9

Increase the DC offset to 3.36 volts in the function generator. It shifts even more over the horizontal line.

Step 10

Decrease the DC offset to -5 volts in the function generator. The sine wave shifts below the horizontal line.

Step 11

Change the DC offset to 0.

Step 12

Increase the frequency to 161 Hz.

Step 13

Decrease the frequency to 20 Hz. You can see two full cycles of the sine wave.
