Connect the battery, capacitor, resistor, and switch in series with the LED.

Close the switch to start charging the capacitor. The LED will light up as current flows through the circuit and charges the capacitor.

Over time, you will notice the LED gradually dimming as the capacitor charges and the current decreases.

After the capacitor is fully charged, open the switch to disconnect the battery. Then, connect the LED directly across the capacitor (without the battery) to observe the discharge process.

The LED will light up again, gradually dimming as the capacitor discharges its stored energy through the LED.

This experiment demonstrates how a capacitor stores energy in an electric field when charging and then releases that energy when discharging.

Capacitors help stabilize voltage changes, acting as a temporary power source during fluctuations.

A multimeter can measure the capacitor's voltage to monitor how it charges and discharges over time, providing a visual representation of the capacitor’s behavior.

- Close the switch to allow current to flow through the circuit.
- Measure the voltage across the capacitor using the multimeter.
- Observe how the voltage across the capacitor increases from 0V to 5V as the capacitor charges.
- Open the switch to disconnect the power source.
- Watch the multimeter again and observe how the voltage across the capacitor decreases over time, eventually reaching 0V.

- The capacitor will charge up to 5V and discharge back to 0V.
- The time constant (τ = R × C) will determine how fast the capacitor charges and discharges.

The simplest electronic circuit to learn about capacitors is a basic RC (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit. This circuit demonstrates capacitor charging and discharging of a capacitor.

This experiment demonstrates the basic function of a capacitor in a circuit, its ability to store and gradually release electrical energy.

When the switch is turned on, the capacitor charges up to the voltage of the battery (9 volts), as shown on the multimeter. This demonstrates the capacitor's ability to store electrical energy.

When the switch is turned off, the circuit opens, and the capacitor gradually releases its stored energy through the resistor and LED. This slow discharge is observed as a gradual decrease in voltage across the capacitor and a corresponding dimming of the LED.

The resistors control the rate at which the capacitor charges and discharges, ensuring that the current remains within safe limits for the LED and demonstrating how resistors can manage the speed of charging and discharging in a capacitor circuit.

The main advantage of capacitor over a battery is they can rapidly charge and discharge compared to batteries. This makes it ideal for short-term energy storage and quick power delivery.

This experiment demonstrates the capacitor's ability to store and gradually release energy in a circuit. It shows how capacitors maintain voltage temporarily when disconnected and how resistors influence the rate of charging and discharging.

By observing a simple RC (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit, we explore how capacitors charge and discharge, stabilizing voltage changes and acting as temporary power sources.

### **Energy Storage in Capacitor**

Demonstrate how a capacitor stores and releases energy by observing its charging and discharging behavior. The main advantage of capacitor over a battery is they can rapidly charge and discharge compared to batteries. This makes it ideal for short-term energy storage and quick power delivery.

A capacitor temporarily stores energy in the form of an electric field and can release it when needed. This experiment shows:

- How a capacitor charges from a power source.
- How it discharges and powers an LED when disconnected from the battery.

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **Energy Storage and Release:**
   - The capacitor stores energy when connected to the battery.
   - It releases this stored energy when connected to the LED.

2. **Charging and Discharging:**
   - Capacitors take a finite time to charge and discharge, depending on their capacitance and the circuit's resistance.

3. **Temporary Power Supply:**
   - The capacitor acts as a temporary power source, lighting the LED briefly even after the battery is removed.

This experiment demonstrates the basic functionality of capacitors as energy storage components in electronic circuits.

#### **Capacitor Behavior**

A capacitor charges when connected to a voltage source, storing energy up to the supply voltage. When disconnected, it releases this stored energy gradually. Resistors control the rate of energy flow, protecting other components and demonstrating the predictable behavior of the RC circuit.

By toggling the switch, we observe the capacitor storing and releasing energy, with the LEDs acting as visual indicators of the current flow and voltage changes.

### **Steps**

1. **Run the Simulation:**
   - Start with the switch in the "on" position, connecting the battery to the capacitor through the resistor.

2. **Observe Charging:**
   - The blue LED lights up as the capacitor charges. Its brightness gradually dims as the capacitor reaches full charge and the current decreases.

3. **Toggle the Switch:**
   - Turn the switch "off" to disconnect the battery. The red LED lights up, gradually dimming as the capacitor discharges its stored energy through the resistor and LED.

4. **Monitor Voltage:**
   - Use a multimeter to measure the capacitor's voltage during charging and discharging. Note the gradual increase and decrease in voltage over time.

### **Observations**

1. **Charging Phase:**
   - When the switch is "on," the capacitor charges through the resistor, with the voltage across it rising to match the battery voltage (\(9 \, \text{V}\)).
   - The blue LED gradually dims as the current decreases, demonstrating the charging process.

2. **Discharging Phase:**
   - When the switch is "off," the capacitor discharges its stored energy through the red LED and resistor.
   - The red LED dims as the capacitor’s voltage decreases, eventually reaching \(0 \, \text{V}\).

3. **Role of the Resistor:**
   - The resistor limits current flow, protecting the LEDs and ensuring the charging/discharging process occurs gradually.

### Results

1. **Energy Storage:**
   - The capacitor stores energy when connected to a voltage source and releases it when disconnected, providing a temporary power supply.

2. **Controlled Discharge:**
   - The resistor slows the discharge process, demonstrating how resistors influence the time constant (\(\tau = R \times C\)) of an RC circuit.

3. **Applications:**
   - Capacitors stabilize voltage fluctuations, act as temporary power supplies, and control timing in circuits.

This experiment demonstrates the capacitor behavior in energy storage and controlled release. By charging and discharging the capacitor in a circuit, we observe its behavior and understand the influence of resistors in managing current flow. The visualization through LEDs shows the capacitor’s function in electronic systems, from voltage stabilization to timing and energy storage.
