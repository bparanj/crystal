Summarize:

This experiment demonstrates the frequency response of an RC circuit and how it acts as a two-stage low-pass filter, affecting the input and output waveforms as the input frequency is varied.

1. RC Circuit Behavior:
   - The circuit consists of two RC stages connected in series.
   - Each RC stage filters high-frequency components, passing lower frequencies while attenuating higher ones.

2. Input Waveform:
   - The function generator provides a sine wave with adjustable frequency (e.g., 132 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, etc.).
   - The input waveform remains unchanged regardless of the frequency because it’s directly supplied by the function generator.

3. Low-Frequency Response:
   - At low frequencies (e.g., 132 Hz), the capacitors charge and discharge slowly, allowing most of the signal to pass through.
   - The output waveform closely resembles the input waveform, showing minimal attenuation.

4. High-Frequency Attenuation:
   - At higher frequencies (e.g., 2 kHz, 9 kHz), the capacitors charge and discharge more quickly, impeding the passage of higher-frequency components.
   - The output waveform shows significant attenuation and may appear rounded or flattened as higher frequencies are filtered out.

5. Phase Shift:
   - The RC filter introduces a phase shift between the input and output signals. This shift increases as the frequency increases, demonstrating the frequency-dependent nature of capacitive circuits.

6. Cumulative Filtering Effect:
   - The two-stage design enhances the filtering effect, making the circuit more effective at attenuating high frequencies compared to a single RC filter.

### Applications

- Signal Smoothing: Reducing noise or ripples in electronic signals.
- Low-Pass Filtering: Allowing only low-frequency signals to pass, useful in audio and communication systems.
- Frequency Separation: Separating or attenuating unwanted high-frequency components in mixed signals.

This experiment demonstrates properties of RC circuits, demonstrating their behavior as frequency-dependent filters and their practical use in signal processing.

### Context and Problem

The band-pass filter is a basic circuit in signal processing, designed to allow a specific range of frequencies to pass while attenuating out of range frequencies. By combining two RC filters — one acting as a high-pass filter and the other as a low-pass filter, this experiment demonstrates the frequency-dependent behavior of RC circuits and how they shape input signals based on frequency.

### Terminology

**Band-Pass Filter:**

A circuit that allows frequencies within a specified range to pass while attenuating frequencies above and below that range.

**High-Pass Filter:**

A circuit that attenuates low frequencies and passes high frequencies.

**Low-Pass Filter:**

A circuit that attenuates high frequencies and passes low frequencies.

**Frequency Response:**

The behavior of a circuit as a function of input signal frequency, observed as changes in amplitude or phase.

### Setup

#### Components

- Two 0.1 µF capacitors
- Two 10 kΩ resistors
- Function generator (adjustable frequency and amplitude)
- Oscilloscopes (for input and output signals)

### Steps

#### **Step 1: **

1. **First RC Stage (High-Pass Filter):**
   - Connect a 0.1 µF capacitor between g4 and g5.
   - Connect a 10 kΩ resistor between f5 and d5.

2. **Second RC Stage (Low-Pass Filter):**
   - Connect a 10 kΩ resistor between d11 and f11.
   - Connect a 0.1 µF capacitor between a11 and a12.

3. **Combine the Stages:**
   - Connect the junction of the first capacitor and resistor (j5) to the junction of the second resistor and capacitor (j11) using a green wire.

4. - Connect the first resistor to the negative power rail using a black wire from a5.
   - Connect the second capacitor to the negative power rail using a black wire from a12.
   - Connect the first capacitor’s free terminal to the positive power rail using a red wire from j4.

#### **Step 2:

   - Configure it to generate a sine wave with an initial frequency of 1 kHz, an amplitude of 5V, and a DC offset of 0.
   - Connect the function generator’s positive terminal to the positive power rail and its negative terminal to the negative power rail.

   - Connect an oscilloscope to observe the input:
     - Positive terminal to the function generator’s positive terminal.
     - Negative terminal to the function generator’s negative terminal.
   - Set the oscilloscope’s time division to 200 µs and run the simulation to confirm the input waveform.

#### **Step 3:

   - Connect the oscilloscope’s positive terminal to the junction of the second resistor and capacitor (f11).
   - Connect the oscilloscope’s negative terminal to the negative power rail.

   - Observe the output waveform on the oscilloscope at various input frequencies.

### Observations

#### **Low Frequencies (132 Hz):**

- The first RC stage (high-pass filter) attenuates the signal slightly due to the low frequency.
- The second RC stage (low-pass filter) allows the signal to pass with minimal attenuation.
- The output resembles the input waveform with minor phase shifts.

#### **Mid Frequencies (1–3 kHz):**

- Both stages work together, creating a passband where frequencies around 1 kHz pass through with minimal attenuation.
- The output waveform closely resembles the input with slight amplitude reduction and phase shift.

#### **High Frequencies (9 kHz and Above):**

- The first RC stage allows high frequencies to pass, but the second RC stage attenuates them significantly.
- At very high frequencies (e.g., 9 kHz), the output amplitude is greatly reduced, appearing as a flattened waveform.

#### Behavior of the Band-Pass Filter

1. **Low-Frequency Attenuation:**

   - The high-pass filter attenuates low frequencies, allowing only higher frequencies to proceed to the second stage.

2. **Passband:**

   - Frequencies within the passband (around 1–3 kHz) pass through both stages with minimal attenuation, producing a clear output waveform.

3. **High-Frequency Attenuation:**

   - The low-pass filter attenuates high frequencies, ensuring they do not appear in the output.

4. **Phase Shifts:**

   - Both RC stages introduce phase shifts, which increase as the frequency approaches the filter’s cutoff limits.

The band-pass filter demonstrates how combining high-pass and low-pass filters creates a circuit that selectively passes frequencies within a specific range.

1. **Frequency Selectivity:**

The circuit allows mid-range frequencies to pass while attenuating both lower and higher frequencies.

2. **Two-Stage Design:**

The combination of RC filters enhances the overall filtering effect, providing sharper transitions between the passband and attenuation regions.

3. **Applications:**

Band-pass filters are used in audio processing, communication systems, and signal conditioning to isolate specific frequency components.

By understanding the frequency-dependent behavior of RC circuits, we can design filters for a wide range of signal processing tasks. This experiment demonstrates the band-pass filter and its role in shaping signal behavior.
