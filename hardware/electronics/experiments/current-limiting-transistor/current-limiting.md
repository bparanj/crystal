Steps

Step 1

Take a breadboard.

Image 2

Step 2

Take a LED. Connect it to g4 and g5 in the breadboard.

Image 3

Step 3

Take a NPN transistor. Connect it to g8, g9 and g10 in the breadboard.

Step 4

Cathode of LED:

Collector of transistor:

a6

Connect the cathode of LED to the collector of the transistor. This is the green line from f4 to f8.

Image 8

Step 5

Connect 1 k ohm resistor to the base of the transistor. Resistor is connected to f9 and d9 in the breadboard.

PENDING

Base of the transistor image is missing.

Step 6

Take a potentiometer. Change its value to 1 M ohm in the settings. Connect it to g16, g17 and g18 in the breadboard.

Step 7

Terminal 1 of the potentiometer:

Image 11

Connect the terminal 1 of the potentiometer to the postive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Step 8

Wiper of the potentiometer:

image 13

Connect the wiper of the potentiometer to the other end of the resistor. This is the green line from f17 to c9 in the breadboard.

Step 9

Emitter of the transistor:

image 16

Connect the emitter to the ground. This is the black line from f10 to the ground.

Image 17

Step 10

Connect the anode of the LED to the postive terminal of the power rails in the breadboard.

Image 18

This is the red line from j5 to the postive terminal.

Step 11

Take a power supply. Change the settings to 5 volts.

Image 20

Step 12

Connect the power supply to the breadboard.

Step 13

Run the simulation. You can see the current through the circuit is 473 mA. This exceeds the maximum ratings for a LED. So the LED gets damaged. THe potentiometer setting is at its lowest resistance. This allows too much current to flow through the circuit.

Step 14

Rotate the potentiometer control clockwise. This reduces the current to a safe level: 7.88 mA. The red LED is now on and operating normally.

Image 23

Step 15

Rotate the control even further. The current decreases, as the resistance provided by the potentiometer increases. The current is reduced by almost half.

Image 24

Step 16

You can keep increasing the resistance of the potentiometer and observe the effect on the LED.
