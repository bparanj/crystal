This is a high value for inductor. We are using it to make it easy to observe the use of inductor in a basic circuit.

Step 14

Turn off slideswitch. You can see the LED is still on but the brightness is lower when the switch was on. The circuit was closed when the switch was on. When we turn off the switch, we have a open circuit. It might be a surprise to see the LED is on when the circuit is open.

Within a few seconds the LED slowly fades and turns off.

This experiment demonstrates inductor behavior in a DC circuit. We saw how an inductor responds to a sudden disconnection of current.

When the circuit is closed, current flows through the inductor, LED, and resistor. The inductor builds up a magnetic field and stores energy as long as current flows through it.

When the switch is turned off, the circuit is opened. The inductor resists this sudden change and tries to maintain the current flow by releasing its stored energy. This causes the LED to remain on for a short time, even though the switch is open, demonstrating that the inductor is providing current. As the inductor releases its stored energy, the current gradually decreases, causing the LED to dim over time until it fully turns off. The 6 Henry inductor, high inductance, allows the effects to be observed, with a slower current decay and a visible dimming effect in the LED.

This experiment demonstrates how an inductor stores energy in a magnetic field and releases it when current flow is interrupted, providing current that keeps the LED on briefly. This is a basic principle of inductors in DC circuits and shows their role in maintaining current flow temporarily even when power source is not present. Surprising thing is that the circuit is open when the switch is turned off, but current flow due to inductor still flows through the open circuit.

Current doesn't simply stop when we open a circuit. This reveals that inductors resist changes in current flow. As current flows through the circuit, the inductor builds its magnetic field. Energy accumulates.

The inductor - faced with a sudden change - demonstrates its core nature. It maintains current flow despite the open circuit. It shows us how energy storage manifests in magnetic fields.

The LED's behavior tells us more. Its gradual dimming reveals the inductor's energy release. This isn't random flickering - it's a systematic decay. The 6 Henry inductance gives us time to observe the underlying principle at work.

The inductor doesn't merely resist change - it transforms our understanding of circuit behavior. It challenges our notion that current stops when switches open. It reveals circuits as energy systems, not just paths for electron flow.

This principle is applied in switching power supplies, voltage regulators, and other applications. The inductor's behavior becomes a basic tool for circuit design.

### Context and Problem

This experiment demonstrates the behavior of an inductor in a DC circuit, particularly its response to the sudden interruption of current. Inductors have a unique ability to resist changes in current.

### Terminology

**Inductor:**

A passive electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when current flows through it.

**Magnetic Field:**

The field generated around the inductor due to current, where energy is stored.

**Inductance (6 Henry):**

A measure of an inductor's ability to store magnetic energy, with higher values leading to more pronounced effects.

When the circuit is closed, current flows through the inductor, LED, and resistor. During this phase, the inductor begins storing energy in its magnetic field. The system appears stable: the LED is illuminated as expected, and the inductor’s role remains latent.

The switch introduces a disruption. Turning off the switch opens the circuit, ostensibly cutting off the current. However, the inductor resists this sudden change. It acts to maintain continuity by releasing the energy stored in its magnetic field, temporarily sustaining the current. This behavior results in the LED staying lit momentarily despite the open circuit. Over time, as the energy depletes, the current diminishes, causing the LED to dim and eventually turn off.

**Energy Storage:**

The inductor captures and holds energy in its magnetic field while the circuit remains closed. This is akin to a spring being compressed, primed to release stored energy when external forces change.

**Energy Release:**

Upon opening the circuit, the inductor opposes the abrupt cessation of current by transforming its magnetic field back into electrical energy, pushing current through the LED and resistor.

**Observable Effect:**

The 6 Henry inductor’s high inductance allows a slower release of energy, resulting in a visible, gradual dimming of the LED. This delay emphasizes the inductor’s function as a temporary energy source.

In DC circuits inductors maintain current flow even when the power source is removed. This experiment demonstrates a fundamental principle: inductors store energy in a magnetic field and release it when needed, exception to the regular behavior of circuits where current cannot flow in an open circuit. The LED’s illumination after the switch is opened underscores the inductor's ability to momentarily act as a current source, revealing its utility in maintaining circuit stability during transitions.

Inductors maintain current flow in DC circuits even when the power source is removed. This experiment demonstrates how inductors store energy in a magnetic field and release it when needed. It is an exception to the normal behavior of a circuit where current cannot flow in an open circuit. The LED’s illumination after the switch is opened underscores the inductor's ability to momentarily act as a current source, revealing its utility in maintaining circuit stability during transitions.

This behavior is useful for applications such as surge protection, energy storage, and current smoothing, where managing interruptions or changes in current is crucial.
