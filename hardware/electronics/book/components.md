- **Resistor**: Opposes the flow of current (\( V = IR \)).
- **Capacitor**: Opposes changes in voltage by storing energy in an electric field (\( I = C \frac{dV}{dt} \)).
- **Inductor**: Opposes changes in current by storing energy in a magnetic field (\( V = L \frac{dI}{dt} \)).

Yes, here are examples of discrete components that "oppose" something:

1. **Resistor**: Opposes the flow of current.
2. **Capacitor**: Opposes changes in voltage.
3. **Inductor**: Opposes changes in current.
4. **Diode**: Opposes current flow in one direction (allows in the other).
5. **Zener Diode**: Opposes voltage beyond a specific reverse breakdown value.
6. **Thermistor**: Opposes current based on temperature (NTC/PTC behavior).
7. **Varistor**: Opposes voltage surges (voltage-dependent resistor). 

Each of these components creates opposition based on its specific physical or electrical properties.
