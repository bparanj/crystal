What does the experiment demonstrate?

The experiment demonstrates the current divider rule, which states that in a parallel circuit, the current through each resistor is inversely proportional to its resistance. This principle is used in analyzing and designing circuits with parallel components.

This experiment shows that in a parallel circuit, current divides between branches based on their resistance values. The lower the resistance, the higher the current flow in that branch.

The current is equal when the value of the resistors are equal. If they are different, the lower value resistor allows more current to flow through that part of the circuit. When resistors are connected in parallel, the total current supplied by the battery is divided between the resistors. The amount of current through each resistor depends on its resistance.

Lower resistance allows more current to flow through that branch of the circuit. In this setup, the 1 kΩ resistor allows more current than the 2 kΩ resistor when they are different.

When both resistors are equal (1 kΩ each), the current divides equally, with each resistor receiving half of the total current through the circuit.

To measure the current through each resistor, the multimeter is connected in series with each resistor in turn.

In a current divider, the total current \( I_{\text{total}} \) entering the parallel branches splits among the branches, with the amount of current in each branch inversely proportional to the resistance of that branch.

For two resistors \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) in parallel, the current through each resistor can be calculated as:

- Current through \( R_1 \):
  \[
  I_1 = I_{\text{total}} \cdot \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}
  \]

- Current through \( R_2 \):
  \[
  I_2 = I_{\text{total}} \cdot \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}
  \]

#### Components:

1. DC Power Source: e.g., 9V battery or DC supply.
2. Resistor \( R_1 \): e.g., 1 kΩ.
3. Resistor \( R_2 \): e.g., 2 kΩ.
4. Ammeter or Multimeter: To measure the current through each branch.

#### Setup:

Connect the positive terminal of the DC power source to one end of both \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) resistors.

Connect the other end of \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) to the negative terminal of the power supply (forming a parallel circuit).

Place an ammeter in each branch or use a multimeter to measure the current through \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \).
Alternatively, you could calculate the expected currents using the formulas above.

The current through each resistor depends on its resistance. For example, if \( R_1 = 1 \, \text{kΩ} \) and \( R_2 = 2 \, \text{kΩ} \) with a total current \( I_{\text{total}} \), more current will flow through \( R_1 \) (lower resistance) than through \( R_2 \).

This simple circuit shows how current divides between parallel branches based on resistance, following the principle of a current divider.
