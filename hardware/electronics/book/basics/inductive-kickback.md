### **Inductor to Demonstrate Inductive Kickback**

Demonstrate the concept of **inductive kickback**, which shows how an inductor resists changes in current and generates a voltage spike when the circuit is interrupted.

### **Components**

1. **Battery** (e.g., 9V)
2. **Inductor** (e.g., 100 mH)
3. **LED**
4. **Switch**

An inductor resists changes in current. When the current flowing through an inductor is suddenly interrupted, the collapsing magnetic field generates a voltage spike (inductive kickback) that can briefly light an LED.

### **Steps**

#### Step 1:

1. Connect the **negative terminal** of the battery to one terminal of the **inductor**.
2. Connect the other terminal of the inductor to the **anode** (longer leg) of the **LED**.
3. Connect the **cathode** (shorter leg) of the LED to a **switch** .
4. Connect the switch back to the **positive terminal** of the battery.

#### Step 2: Run the Experiment

QUESTION

The turn off switch dims the LED at the same rate if there was no inductor. How to make this more prominent?

To make inductive kickback more prominent, try these modifications:

1. Increase inductance (larger inductor or more turns)
2. Use higher current through the inductor before switching
3. Add a parallel capacitor to create an LC circuit
4. Reduce circuit resistance to minimize damping
5. Use a MOSFET for faster switching than a mechanical switch
6. Add a scope probe across the inductor to visualize the voltage spike

To make the **inductive kickback effect** more prominent in your experiment, consider the following adjustments:

1. **Increase the Inductance**:
   - Use an inductor with a higher inductance value. A larger inductance generates a stronger voltage spike when the current is interrupted, making the LED brighter for a brief moment.

2. **Add a Diode Across the Inductor**:
   - Place a flyback diode (e.g., 1N4007) across the inductor, with its cathode connected to the positive terminal. This protects the circuit and directs the kickback energy to the LED instead of dissipating it elsewhere.

3. **Decrease the Series Resistance**:
   - Minimize any resistance in the circuit (other than the LED and necessary components). Lower resistance allows more current to flow through the inductor, increasing the stored energy.

4. **Adjust the LED Placement**:
   - Place the LED in parallel with the inductor. When the switch turns off, the kickback current flows through the LED, making it momentarily brighter before dimming.

5. **Switch Off Faster**:
   - Use a faster switch or a transistor to interrupt the current more abruptly. A quicker turn-off increases the rate of current change (\(di/dt\)), resulting in a stronger inductive voltage spike.

6. **Increase the Power Supply Voltage**:
   - Use a higher voltage power source, within the LED's limits, to increase the current flowing through the inductor. This results in more energy stored in the inductor and a larger kickback effect.

These adjustments will make the inductive kickback effect more visually prominent by amplifying the LED’s brightness momentarily after the switch is turned off.

1. **Close the switch:** Allow current to flow through the circuit, building a magnetic field in the inductor.
2. **Open the switch quickly:** Interrupt the current flow. Observe the LED flashing briefly due to the voltage spike generated by the collapsing magnetic field in the inductor.

### **Observation**

- The LED briefly flashes when the circuit is opened, even though the battery is disconnected from the LED at that moment.
- The brightness and duration of the flash depend on the inductance value and the rate of current interruption.

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **Inductive Kickback:**
   - When the circuit is interrupted, the inductor generates a high-voltage spike due to the collapsing magnetic field, briefly lighting the LED.

2. **Energy Storage in Magnetic Fields:**
   - The inductor stores energy in its magnetic field while the current flows.

3. **Current Continuity:**
   - Inductors resist sudden changes in current, generating a voltage spike to maintain current flow when the circuit is disrupted.

### **Applications**

- This principle is used in flyback diodes to protect circuits from voltage spikes.
- Inductive kickback is harnessed in systems like ignition coils and boost converters.

This experiment introduces the essential behavior of inductors and their role in resisting changes in current flow.

## Inductive Kickback vs Back EMF

**inductive kickback** and **back EMF** are related concepts, but they are not the same. They describe different phenomena related to inductors and their interaction with current and voltage in a circuit.

### **Inductive Kickback**

A voltage spike generated when the current through an inductor is suddenly interrupted.

**Why it happens:**

When the current flowing through an inductor changes abruptly (e.g., when a switch is opened), the magnetic field around the inductor collapses rapidly. According to Faraday's Law, this rapid change in magnetic flux induces a high voltage in the opposite direction to the current flow.

- **Characteristics:**

  - Short-lived, high-voltage spike.
  - Can damage components if not managed (e.g., flyback diodes are used to protect circuits).
  - Typically occurs when switching inductive loads, like motors or solenoids.

**Example:**

When turning off a relay or motor, the collapsing magnetic field generates a high voltage, potentially damaging the circuit.

### **Back EMF**

A voltage generated by an inductor (or a motor, which acts as an inductor) in response to the changing magnetic field caused by its own current.

**Why it happens:**

As current flows through an inductor or motor, the changing magnetic field induces a voltage (back EMF) opposing the applied voltage, as per Lenz's Law.

**Characteristics:**

  - Continuous while the current or motion changes.
  - Opposes the applied voltage, reducing the net voltage across the inductor.
  - Not a sudden spike—it is a steady effect during normal operation.

In a DC motor, the back EMF increases with motor speed, reducing the current drawn from the power source.

|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **When it Occurs**       | Sudden interruption of current.                | Continuous during operation with current flow.  |
| **Duration**             | Short-lived voltage spike.                     | Continuous opposing voltage.                    |
| **Cause**                | Collapsing magnetic field (rapid change).      | Changing magnetic flux (steady operation).      |
| **Voltage Direction**    | Opposes the original current flow.             | Opposes the applied voltage.                    |
| **Example**              | Turning off a relay or motor.                  | Running motor generating voltage as it spins.   |


- **Inductive Kickback** is a transient effect caused by a rapid change in current.
- **Back EMF** is a continuous effect caused by normal operation of an inductor or motor.

Both are rooted in Faraday's Law of Induction but occur under different conditions.
