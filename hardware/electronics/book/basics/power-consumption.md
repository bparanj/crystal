**Power consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh)** is calculated by multiplying the power used by a device in kilowatts (kW) by the time it operates in hours (h). This is a common unit used by utility companies to measure energy usage.

### **Formula for Power Consumption**
\[
\text{Energy Consumption} (kWh) = \text{Power} (kW) \times \text{Time} (h)
\]

Where:
- **Power**: Power rating of the device in kilowatts (1 kilowatt = 1,000 watts).
- **Time**: Duration the device is in use, in hours.

### **Steps to Calculate Power Consumption**
1. **Convert Power to Kilowatts**:
   - If the power is given in watts (\(W\)):
     \[
     \text{Power} (kW) = \frac{\text{Power} (W)}{1,000}
     \]

2. **Multiply by Time**:
   - Determine how many hours (\(h\)) the device operates.
   - Multiply power in \(kW\) by time in hours to get energy consumption in \(kWh\).

### **Example 1: A 100-Watt Light Bulb**
- Power rating: \(100 \, W = \frac{100}{1,000} = 0.1 \, kW\).
- Operating time: \(5 \, \text{hours}\).

\[
\text{Energy Consumption} = 0.1 \, \text{kW} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 0.5 \, \text{kWh}.
\]

### **Example 2: A 2,000-Watt Air Conditioner**
- Power rating: \(2,000 \, W = \frac{2,000}{1,000} = 2 \, kW\).
- Operating time: \(8 \, \text{hours/day}\), for \(30 \, \text{days}\).

\[
\text{Energy Consumption per Day} = 2 \, \text{kW} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 16 \, \text{kWh}.
\]
\[
\text{Energy Consumption for 30 Days} = 16 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 480 \, \text{kWh}.
\]

### **Applications**
1. **Electricity Bills**:
   - Utility companies bill customers based on \(kWh\) usage.
   - Cost calculation:
     \[
     \text{Cost} = \text{Energy Consumption (kWh)} \times \text{Rate per kWh}.
     \]
     Example: If the rate is $0.12/kWh and the energy consumption is \(480 \, \text{kWh}\), the cost is:
     \[
     \text{Cost} = 480 \times 0.12 = \$57.60.
     \]

2. **Energy Management**:
   - Helps monitor and reduce power usage by identifying high-energy devices.

3. **Appliance Ratings**:
   - Energy-efficient devices are often rated in terms of their \(kWh\) consumption.

### **Points**
- **Kilowatt-hour (kWh)** measures energy, not power.
- Accurate calculations require knowing the device's power rating and usage duration.
- Lowering usage time or choosing lower-power devices reduces energy consumption and costs.
