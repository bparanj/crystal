Yes, both polarized and non-polarized capacitors can power an LED briefly when the switch is turned off, as long as they are connected correctly in the circuit and have stored enough charge. The capacitor's job here is to release its stored energy to maintain current flow for a short time, which can temporarily power the LED after the power source is disconnected.

### Differences in Behavior:

1. Polarized Capacitor:
   - Orientation matters: A polarized capacitor (like an electrolytic capacitor) has a positive and negative terminal, so it must be connected in the correct polarity in the circuit. Reversing it can damage the capacitor.
   - Typically higher capacitance: Polarized capacitors generally have higher capacitance values, making them better suited for applications where you want to power the LED for a slightly longer period after the switch is turned off.

2. Non-Polarized Capacitor:
   - Orientation doesn't matter: Non-polarized capacitors (such as ceramic or film capacitors) can be connected in any direction, as they do not have polarity.
   - Usually lower capacitance: Non-polarized capacitors typically have lower capacitance values, so they store less charge and thus may only keep the LED on for a very short time after the switch is turned off.

### How Each Type Powers the LED:

- When the switch is turned off, both types of capacitors will discharge their stored energy through the LED, causing it to remain on momentarily. However:
   - A polarized capacitor (with higher capacitance) will typically keep the LED on a bit longer.
   - A non-polarized capacitor (with lower capacitance) will power the LED for a shorter time, resulting in a quicker fade.

Both polarized and non-polarized capacitors can briefly power the LED when the main power is disconnected, but the duration will depend on the capacitance value. Polarized capacitors are generally preferred for this purpose because they can store more charge, sustaining the LED for a longer period.
