It is not clear how to identify the different things in the system

Law of System Completeness: In TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), the Law of System Completeness states that a functional system requires four key elements: engine, transmission, working unit, and control unit. For a system to function effectively, all these components must be present and interdependent.

In the context of a simple electronic circuit with a battery, resistor, and LED:

1. Engine (Battery):

The battery serves as the energy source, providing the electrical power needed to drive the circuit.

2. Transmission (Resistor):

The resistor controls and regulates the current flowing through the circuit. This element adjusts the energy to an optimal level, ensuring that the LED receives the correct amount of current.

3. Working Unit (LED):

The LED is the primary component that performs the intended function—emitting light when current flows through it.

4. Control Unit (Circuit Path):

The circuit path (wiring) and connections control the direction of current flow, ensuring the energy moves through each component in sequence.

How is the circuit path a control unit?

By having all these elements, the circuit completes a functional system as defined by TRIZ. The battery powers the LED, the resistor regulates the current to protect the LED, and the wiring controls the flow, allowing the LED to perform its task effectively.

Why is the wiring not the transmission?

Let's examine the electronic circuit consisting of a battery, resistor, and LED through the lens of the Law of System Completeness from TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving). This law states that a complete technical system should have four essential parts: an engine, a transmission, a working unit, and a control unit. Let's break down our circuit in this context:

Now, let's analyze each component of the circuit in terms of the Law of System Completeness:

1. Engine (Energy Source): The battery

Function:

Provides the electrical energy to power the system

In TRIZ terms:

This is the engine or energy source of the system

Is engine and energy source the same?

2. Transmission: The resistor

Function:

Controls the flow of current in the circuit

In TRIZ terms: This acts as the transmission, regulating the energy from the source

3. Working Unit: The LED (Light Emitting Diode)

Function:

Converts electrical energy into light

In TRIZ terms: This is the working unit, performing the main function of the system

4. Control Unit: Not explicitly present

   - In a simple circuit like this, there's no separate control unit
   - The resistor partly serves a control function by limiting current

If you use a switch. Does it become a control unit?

5. Interface: The wires connecting components

While not one of the four main parts in the Law of System Completeness, the wires serve as interfaces between components

Why is wire an interface. This seems wrong. It is more like transmission.

This circuit demonstrates most elements of a complete technical system according to TRIZ:

- It has a clear energy source (battery)
- It includes a transmission to regulate energy flow (resistor)
- It has a working unit that performs the main function (LED)

However, it lacks a dedicated control unit, which in more complex circuits might be represented by a switch or a microcontroller. This simplicity makes the circuit reliable and efficient for its purpose, but also limits its functionality.

Understanding this circuit through the Law of System Completeness can help in identifying potential areas for improvement or innovation, such as adding control elements or optimizing the interaction between components.

The Law of System Completeness in TRIZ states that for a technical system to function, it needs at least four essential components:

1. Engine (energy source),
2. Transmission (element that carries the energy),
3. Working Unit (where the action occurs),
4. Control (something that regulates the action).

Let’s map these to a simple circuit with a battery, resistor, push button, and LED.

### Circuit Components:

1. Battery (Engine):

The battery supplies energy to the circuit, fulfilling the role of the “Engine” in the TRIZ system.

2. Resistor (Transmission):

The resistor controls the current, ensuring it flows at a safe level for the LED. In TRIZ, this acts as the “Transmission” by adjusting the energy flow to avoid damaging the working unit (LED).

3. Push Button (Control):

The push button allows the user to control when the LED turns on. In TRIZ terms, this is the “Control” component, allowing regulation of the system's operation.

4. LED (Working Unit):

The LED is the “Working Unit,” where the intended action—light production—takes place when the system is activated.

### Application of the Law of System Completeness

According to the Law of System Completeness, each component plays a critical role, and the system wouldn’t function as intended if any one component was missing:

- Without the Battery, there’s no power source.
- Without the Resistor, the LED could burn out due to excessive current.
- Without the Push Button, the LED would stay on continuously (if directly connected) or wouldn’t turn on at all (if open).
- Without the LED, there’s no visible output of the system's function.

This basic circuit illustrates how a complete system requires all essential components to work cohesively for the system to perform its intended function.
