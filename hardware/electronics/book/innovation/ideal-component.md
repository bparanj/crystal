## Ideal Resistor

From the perspective of TRIZ , an ideal resistor would embody the concept of Ideality, where the system delivers the maximum useful function with minimal drawbacks or resources.

Useful function:

A resistor's primary function is to limit current in a circuit while ensuring proper voltage division.

Harmful effects:

Real resistors generate heat, consume power, and have limitations like tolerance variations, aging, and noise.

An ideal resistor in TRIZ terms would:
