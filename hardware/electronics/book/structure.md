Where does Zettel format fit in the book structure?

In a book on electronics, an explanation about reading specifications for electronic components is best placed early in the sequence, right after introducing basic concepts of components (like resistors, capacitors, transistors, etc.). Hereâ€™s a suggested sequence:

1. Introduction to Basic Components: Briefly explain what each main component does (resistor, capacitor, diode, transistor, etc.).
2. Reading Specifications (Specs): Introduce how to interpret datasheets and specs for these components. Explain terms like tolerance, power rating, voltage, and current handling.
3. Component Selection: Follow with guidance on choosing the right component for specific applications based on specs.
4. Basic Circuits and Applications: Begin practical applications, using the specs to explain why certain components are chosen in each circuit.

This order builds foundational knowledge, equipping readers to understand and make practical use of component specifications as they dive into circuit design.
