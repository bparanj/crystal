Resistance

Opposition to current flow by a resistor is called **resistance**, denoted as \( R \). It is independent of frequency and is governed by Ohmâ€™s Law:

\[
R = \frac{V}{I}
\]

Where:
- \( R \): Resistance (in ohms)
- \( V \): Voltage (in volts)
- \( I \): Current (in amperes)

Capacitive Reactance

Opposition to current flow by a capacitor is called **reactance**, specifically **capacitive reactance**, denoted as \( X_C \). It is frequency-dependent and calculated using the formula:

\[
X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}
\]

Where:
- \( X_C \): Capacitive reactance (in ohms)
- \( f \): Frequency of the AC signal (in hertz)
- \( C \): Capacitance (in farads)

Inductive Reactance

Opposition to current flow by an inductor is called **inductive reactance**, denoted as \( X_L \). It is frequency-dependent and calculated using the formula:

\[
X_L = 2\pi f L
\]

Where:
- \( X_L \): Inductive reactance (in ohms)
- \( f \): Frequency of the AC signal (in hertz)
- \( L \): Inductance (in henries)

The distinction arises because **resistance** and **capacitance** describe different phenomena:

1. **Resistor**:
   - Resistance is a constant property of a resistor that opposes current flow by converting electrical energy into heat.
   - This opposition is independent of the signal's frequency.

2. **Capacitor**:
   - Capacitance is a measure of a capacitor's ability to store charge, not directly its opposition to current flow.
   - The opposition to current flow by a capacitor is called **reactance** (specifically, **capacitive reactance**) because it varies with the frequency of the signal:
     \[
     X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}
     \]
   - Higher frequency signals encounter less opposition, making the opposition dynamic and dependent on both the capacitance and the signal's frequency.

- **Resistance** is fixed for resistors, so the term resistance captures its opposing behavior.
- **Capacitance** is not directly about opposition; instead, the frequency-dependent **reactance** describes the capacitor's dynamic opposition to current flow.

The distinction arises because **resistance** and **inductance** describe different properties and behaviors:

1. **Resistor**:

   - Resistance is a constant property of a resistor that opposes current flow, converting electrical energy into heat.
   - This opposition is frequency-independent.

2. **Inductor**:

   - Inductance is a measure of an inductor's ability to store energy in a magnetic field, not its direct opposition to current flow.
   - The opposition to current flow by an inductor is called **inductive reactance** because it varies with the frequency of the signal:
     \[
     X_L = 2\pi f L
     \]
   - Higher frequency signals encounter more opposition, making the opposition dynamic and dependent on both the inductance and the signal's frequency.

**Resistance** is a fixed property, so "resistance" directly represents a resistor's behavior.
**Inductance** measures the ability to create a magnetic field, while the opposition it causes is frequency-dependent and described by **reactance**. Hence, the term **inductive reactance** is used for this specific behavior.

Inductors act as a **short circuit** for DC.

1. **Capacitor and DC**:
   - Capacitors block DC because, after the initial charging phase, the voltage across the capacitor becomes constant, and no current flows through the circuit (\( I = C \cdot \frac{dV}{dt} \), and \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 0 \) for DC).

2. **Inductor and DC**:
   - Inductors allow DC to flow freely because their opposition to current (\( V = L \cdot \frac{dI}{dt} \)) depends on changes in current (\( \frac{dI}{dt} \)).
   - For steady DC, \( \frac{dI}{dt} = 0 \), so the inductor behaves like a simple conducting wire (short circuit) after the initial transient.
