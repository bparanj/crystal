conductor

A semiconductor is a type of material that has electrical conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator. This property can control the flow of electricity under specific conditions. Silicon is the most common semiconductor material used in electronics. 

This controllable conductivity makes semiconductors ideal for creating electronic components such as diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits, where precise on/off switching and amplification of electrical signals are required.

They can switch between conducting and non-conducting states, acting like tiny electrical switches. This is the foundation of modern electronics.
