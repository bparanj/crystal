5.  How do inductors store and release energy in a circuit?

Inductors store energy in their magnetic field when current flows through them and release this energy back into the circuit when the current decreases. This property allows inductors to act as energy storage elements in various applications.

An inductor's energy storage capability resembles a spring. When you stretch a spring, it stores potential energy. When you release the spring, it releases that energy back into the system.

Experiment to demonstrate energy storage in inductors:

1) Create a circuit with a power supply, a switch, an inductor (e.g., 1 mH), and an LED in series.
2) Include a resistor in parallel with the LED for protection.
3) Close the switch briefly (e.g., 1 second) and then open it.
4) Observe that the LED remains lit for a short time after opening the switch.
5) The energy equation for an inductor is $E = \frac{1}{2}LI^2$, where E is energy, L is inductance, and I is current.
6) If the inductor is 1 mH and the current is 100 mA, the stored energy would be $E = \frac{1}{2}  0.001  (0.1)^2 = 5  10^{-6}$ joules.

This energy maintains the LED's illumination briefly after the switch opens, demonstrating the inductor's energy storage and release capabilities.
