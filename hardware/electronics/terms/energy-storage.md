Energy storage devices include:

1. **Capacitors** - Store energy in an electric field.
2. **Inductors** - Store energy in a magnetic field.
3. **Batteries** - Store energy chemically.
4. **Flywheels** - Store energy mechanically in rotational motion.
5. **Supercapacitors** - Hybrid of capacitors and batteries.
6. **Fuel cells** - Store energy chemically for conversion to electricity.
7. **Compressed air systems** - Store energy in pressurized air.
8. **Thermal storage** - Store energy as heat.

Each device is suited to specific applications based on energy density, power output, and duration.

In electronics, the commonly used energy storage devices are:

1. **Capacitors** - For short-term energy storage, filtering, and smoothing signals.
2. **Inductors** - For energy storage in magnetic fields, often in power supplies and filters.
3. **Batteries** - For long-term energy storage, powering circuits and devices.
4. **Supercapacitors** - For quick charge/discharge cycles in backup power and memory retention.

These devices are chosen based on the application's requirements for energy density, discharge rate, and physical size.
