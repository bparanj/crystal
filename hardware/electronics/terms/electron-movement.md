Yes, the atom will lose the electron temporarily when it participates in conduction. 

In a conductor, atoms share their outermost (valence) electrons in a "sea of electrons." These electrons are not tightly bound to any specific atom and are free to move under the influence of an electric field. When a current flows, these free electrons drift through the conductor, moving from one atom to another.

Key points:
1. **Electron Detachment:** When an electron leaves an atom, that atom becomes a positively charged ion momentarily.
2. **Reattachment:** The electron does not stay permanently detached. It may attach to another atom as it moves through the conductor.
3. **Balance:** The overall structure of the conductor remains electrically neutral because the electrons are constantly moving and redistributing.

This phenomenon is the essence of electrical conductivity in metals and other conductive materials. The atoms themselves remain stationary, forming the solid structure of the conductor.

Exactly. In a closed circuit, the atom temporarily loses an electron when the free electrons flow under an electric field. However, this loss is quickly balanced because another free electron will replace it, maintaining the electrical neutrality of the atom over time.

### How It Happens:
1. **Free Electrons in a Conductor:** Conductive materials (like metals) have loosely bound outer electrons, forming a "sea of electrons" that can move freely between atoms.
2. **Electric Field Influence:** When an electric field is applied, these free electrons drift in a specific direction, causing current flow.
3. **Temporary Loss and Gain:** 
   - As an electron leaves an atom, that atom becomes a positive ion for a brief moment.
   - The flow of other free electrons ensures that another electron fills the "gap," restoring neutrality.

### Important Insights:
- Atoms themselves do not move; only electrons do.
- The overall number of electrons and positive charges in the conductor stays balanced during the process.
- This constant exchange is why the flow of electrons appears seamless in a circuit. 

This balance ensures that while electrons move, the conductor remains stable and electrically neutral.
