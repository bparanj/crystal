bias

Forward Bias:

Forward bias in a diode is when positive voltage is applied to the anode and negative voltage to the cathode.

When a diode is forward-biased, current flows from the anode to the cathode. This is the conducting state.

Reverse Bias 

Reverse bias in a diode is when positive voltage applied to the cathode and the negative voltage to the anode.

When a diode is reverse-biased, it prevents current from flowing. This is the non-conducting state.

Special Case:

Zener diodes where reverse breakdown occurs.
