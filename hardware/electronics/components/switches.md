A push button makes contact only when pressed and disconnects when released. This is used when momentary activation is needes such as resetting a device, doorbell or keyboards. This is useful for short actions.

A slide switch stays in either on or off position. This is used when you want to turn a device on or off, like a lamp switch. This is for long-term actions.

We use both push buttons and slide switches in electronic circuits because they serve different functions:

A push button is a momentary switch: it only makes contact when pressed and disconnects when released.
Ideal for applications where temporary activation is needed, such as resetting a device, turning on a temporary function (like a doorbell), or controlling input on devices (e.g., keyboards).

Slide Switch:

A slide switch is a maintained switch: it stays in the position it's moved to, either "on" or "off."
Useful for functions that need a lasting state, such as turning a device on/off or toggling between modes (like a lamp switch).

- Push buttons are ideal for short, temporary actions.
- Slide switches are suitable for long-term, persistent settings.
