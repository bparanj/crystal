It's possible to design a basic experiment with an ultrasonic distance sensor in Tinkercad without a microcontroller. However, the functionality will be quite limited. Here’s how you could set it up:

1. Power Source: 

Use a simple 5V power supply to power the sensor.

2. Trigger and Echo Signals: 

Without a microcontroller, generating and interpreting the trigger and echo signals becomes challenging, as these are typically controlled and timed by microcontrollers.

3. Using an Oscilloscope: 

You can connect the Echo pin of the ultrasonic sensor to an oscilloscope in Tinkercad to visualize the output signal. You can see when an object is detected by observing changes in the waveform.

4. LED Indicator: 

As a simpler alternative, you could connect the Echo pin to an LED through a resistor. The LED might briefly light up when an object is detected within a close range, although this would be crude and only useful for very close detection. It won’t give you an exact distance but can act as a basic proximity indicator.

While this setup is limited, it can help demonstrate the basics of how the sensor responds to objects without involving a microcontroller. For precise measurements, though, a microcontroller is necessary to handle the timing and processing.
