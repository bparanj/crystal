# Capacitor V-I Curve Experiment

## Components

- 9V Battery
- 100 µF Capacitor
- 1 kΩ Resistor
- 2 Multimeters
- Breadboard
- Switch (SPST)

## Steps

   - Drag a breadboard into the workspace
   - Add a 9V battery
   - Add a 100 µF capacitor
   - Add a 1 kΩ resistor
   - Add a switch
   - Add 2 multimeters

   - Set first multimeter to measure voltage (connect in parallel with capacitor)
   - Set second multimeter to measure current (connect in series with circuit)

   - Connect battery positive terminal to switch
   - Connect switch to one end of the resistor
   - Connect other end of resistor to capacitor positive lead
   - Connect capacitor negative lead to battery negative terminal
   - Place ammeter in series between resistor and capacitor
   - Place voltmeter in parallel across capacitor

## Measurement

1. Start simulation
2. Close switch to begin charging
3. Record voltage and current readings at these time intervals:
   - 0 ms (immediately after switching on)
   - 20 ms
   - 50 ms
   - 100 ms
   - 200 ms
   - 500 ms

4. Open switch to observe discharge
5. Record same measurements during discharge

## Expected Measurements

| Time (ms) | Voltage (V) | Current (mA) |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| 0         |             |              |
| 20        |             |              |
| 50        |             |              |
| 100       |             |              |
| 200       |             |              |
| 500       |             |              |
