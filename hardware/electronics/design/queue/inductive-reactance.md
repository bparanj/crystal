Objective:

To observe how an inductor affects the current in an AC circuit.

Materials:

- AC power supply (function generator)
- Inductor (e.g., 100 mH)
- Resistor (e.g., 100 ohms)
- Oscilloscope

Procedure:

1. Connect the inductor and resistor in series with the AC power supply.
2. Use the oscilloscope to measure the voltage across the resistor and the inductor.
3. Adjust the frequency of the AC power supply and observe the changes in voltage and current.
4. Note how the current decreases as the frequency increases, indicating the increasing inductive reactance.

Inductive reactance (\( X_L \)) increases with frequency (\( X_L = 2\pi f L \)), causing the current to decrease as the frequency increases.
