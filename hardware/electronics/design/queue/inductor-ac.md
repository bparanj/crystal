The paradox of a conducting wire connected across the leads of an inductor seemingly stopping AC current can be explained by the physics of inductors and how they interact with alternating current (AC) in the presence of a short circuit.

### How an Inductor Stops AC Current Despite a Conducting Wire

1. Inductor Opposes Current Changes:
   - An inductor resists changes in current through it due to its self-inductance. This property generates a back EMF (electromotive force) that opposes the change in current.
   - For AC, which involves continuously changing current, the inductor creates a back EMF proportional to the rate of change of the current (\( V_{ind} = L \frac{dI}{dt} \)).

2. Conducting Wire Creates a Short Circuit:
   - When a conducting wire is placed across the leads of the inductor, it provides a low-resistance path, effectively short-circuiting the inductor.
   - The majority of the current flows through the conducting wire, bypassing the inductor. This reduces the effective current flowing through the inductor and the rest of the circuit.

3. Impedance of the Wire vs. Inductor:
   - A conducting wire has near-zero resistance and no significant inductance. In contrast, the inductor has a significant impedance (\( Z = j\omega L \)), especially at higher frequencies.
   - AC current prefers the path of least impedance, which is the conducting wire. As a result, the inductor is effectively "shorted out," and no significant current flows through it.

- AC Current Path Selection:
   - The conducting wire diverts the AC current because it provides a much easier path (low impedance) compared to the inductor.
- Inductor Effectively Removed:
   - With the conducting wire in place, the inductor no longer influences the circuit because almost no current flows through it.

### Why This Happens:

The paradox arises because:
1. Inductors Resist AC Flow: By their nature, inductors generate opposing EMF to changing currents, creating impedance.
2. Wire’s Low Impedance Dominates: The conducting wire bypasses the inductor, providing a near-zero impedance path that "short-circuits" the inductor's influence on the circuit.

The conducting wire stops AC current from flowing through the inductor by creating a low-impedance path that bypasses the inductor. This behavior is not due to the inductor itself stopping AC but because the AC current follows the path of least impedance, rendering the inductor irrelevant in the circuit.

Here’s a simple experiment to demonstrate how a conducting wire across an inductor’s leads stops AC current by bypassing it with a low-impedance path.

### Experiment: Conducting Wire Shorting an Inductor with AC

To show that a conducting wire across an inductor prevents AC current from flowing through the inductor by creating a low-impedance path.

#### Components:

- 1 AC Power Source (e.g., 5V, 1 kHz signal generator or simulated AC source)
- 1 Inductor (e.g., 100 mH)
- 1 LED with Resistor (e.g., 220 Ω, to indicate current flow through the inductor)
- 1 Conducting Wire
- Breadboard and Wires

#### Steps:

1. Set Up the AC Circuit Without the Wire:
   - Connect the AC power source to one terminal of the inductor.
   - Connect the other terminal of the inductor to the LED in series with the resistor.
   - Complete the circuit by connecting the LED-resistor combination back to the AC source.
   - Observe that the LED lights up, indicating AC current flowing through the inductor.

2. Add the Conducting Wire:
   - Connect a conducting wire directly across the leads of the inductor, creating a low-impedance path.
   - Observe the LED. It should dim significantly or turn off, indicating that the current is now bypassing the inductor through the conducting wire.

- Without the wire, the AC current flows through the inductor, lighting up the LED.
- Adding the wire provides a path with near-zero impedance, diverting the current away from the inductor.
- The inductor is effectively bypassed, and little to no current flows through it, causing the LED to dim or turn off.

### Observations:

1. The LED lights up without the wire, as the AC current flows through the inductor.
2. The LED dims or turns off with the wire, as the current bypasses the inductor through the low-impedance path.

This experiment demonstrates that a conducting wire across an inductor stops AC current from flowing through it by creating a low-impedance alternative path, bypassing the inductor entirely.

Yes, modifications are needed for Tinkercad:

1. AC Power Source:
   - Use a 9V DC power source with a switch to simulate AC behavior manually (turning the switch on/off rapidly).

2. LED Behavior:
   - The LED may not respond dynamically to manual switching, so observe the circuit behavior with a multimeter across the inductor.

3. Simulate Inductor Shorting:
   - Connect a wire across the inductor to observe the current bypassing it, confirmed by measuring current or voltage across the inductor with a multimeter.
