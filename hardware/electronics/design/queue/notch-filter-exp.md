Here’s a simple notch filter experiment you can simulate on Tinkercad:

---

### Objective:
Design and simulate a notch filter circuit to suppress a specific frequency using passive components.

---

### Components Needed:
1. **Resistors** (e.g., 1 kΩ, 10 kΩ)
2. **Capacitors** (e.g., 0.1 µF)
3. **Inductor** (e.g., 10 mH)
4. **Function Generator** (available in Tinkercad)
5. **Oscilloscope** (available in Tinkercad)
6. Breadboard and wires (from Tinkercad’s components).

---

### Circuit Design:
1. **Topology**: Use an LC notch filter (parallel LC circuit in series with a resistor).
   - Connect an inductor (L) and a capacitor (C) in parallel to form a tank circuit.
   - Connect the tank circuit in series with a resistor.

2. **Connections**:
   - Connect the function generator output to one end of the resistor.
   - Connect the parallel LC circuit across the resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the LC circuit to the ground.
   - Use the oscilloscope to measure voltage across the LC circuit.

---

### Steps in Tinkercad:
1. Open **Tinkercad Circuits** and start a new project.
2. Place the resistor, inductor, and capacitor on the breadboard.
3. Connect the function generator to the input of the resistor.
4. Attach the oscilloscope probes across the LC circuit (to monitor the response).
5. Configure the function generator to output a sine wave, starting at a low frequency (e.g., 10 Hz) and sweep up to 10 kHz.
6. Set the oscilloscope to observe the output voltage.

---

### Experiment:
1. Adjust the frequency of the function generator.
2. Observe the oscilloscope’s reading. The notch frequency (\(f_0\)) is where the output voltage drops significantly.
   - Calculate the theoretical notch frequency using:
     \[
     f_0 = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{L C}}
     \]

---

### Analysis:
1. Identify the frequency where the voltage dips sharply on the oscilloscope.
2. Compare the measured notch frequency with the theoretical value.

---

This experiment allows you to visualize the frequency-suppressing behavior of a notch filter while using simple components and tools in Tinkercad.

### Simplest Experiment for a Notch Filter on Tinkercad: Complete Details

---

#### Objective:
To simulate and understand the behavior of a notch filter (frequency suppression circuit) using Tinkercad.

---

#### Components in Tinkercad:
1. **Resistor**: 1 kΩ
2. **Capacitor**: 0.1 µF
3. **Inductor**: 10 mH
4. **Function Generator**: Produces sine wave input.
5. **Oscilloscope**: Measures output voltage.
6. Breadboard and Wires.

---

#### Circuit Diagram:
- The LC tank circuit (inductor + capacitor) is connected in parallel.
- This parallel combination is connected in series with the resistor.

---

#### Connections:
1. Place the **resistor** on the breadboard.
2. Connect the **inductor (10 mH)** and **capacitor (0.1 µF)** in parallel on the breadboard.
   - The inductor and capacitor form the LC tank circuit.
3. Connect one end of the resistor to the **function generator**'s positive terminal.
4. Connect the other end of the resistor to the LC tank circuit.
5. Connect the **oscilloscope** across the LC tank circuit.
6. Connect the ground terminal of the LC circuit and function generator to the breadboard ground.

---

#### Configuration in Tinkercad:
1. **Function Generator**:
   - Set to generate a sine wave.
   - Start with a frequency of **10 Hz** and amplitude of **5 V peak-to-peak**.
   - Gradually increase the frequency up to **10 kHz**.
2. **Oscilloscope**:
   - Attach the probes across the LC circuit.
   - Set time and voltage divisions to clearly observe output voltage.

---

#### Experiment Steps:
1. Start the simulation in Tinkercad.
2. Gradually sweep the function generator’s frequency from **10 Hz to 10 kHz**.
3. Observe the oscilloscope:
   - Notice the voltage drop at a specific frequency. This is the **notch frequency** where the LC tank circuit resonates.
4. Measure the notch frequency using the oscilloscope’s frequency counter or manually from the sine wave pattern.

---

#### Theory:
- The **notch frequency (\(f_0\))** is given by:
  \[
  f_0 = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{L C}}
  \]
  - For \(L = 10 \, \text{mH}\) and \(C = 0.1 \, \mu\text{F}\):
    \[
    f_0 = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{10 \times 10^{-3} \times 0.1 \times 10^{-6}}} \approx 5.03 \, \text{kHz}
    \]

---

#### Expected Outcome:
1. At approximately 5 kHz, the output voltage across the LC circuit will drop significantly, showing the notch filter’s ability to suppress this frequency.
2. Above or below this frequency, the voltage will increase again, showing normal signal transmission.

---

This simple setup gives a clear understanding of how notch filters suppress a specific frequency, with hands-on visualization using Tinkercad’s tools.
