Here are the fundamental analog building blocks in electronics:

1. Basic Components:
   - Resistors: Current limiting, voltage division
   - Capacitors: Timing, filtering, coupling/decoupling
   - Inductors: Energy storage, filtering
   - Diodes: Rectification, protection
   - Transistors: Amplification, switching

2. Core Circuit Blocks:
   - Voltage Dividers
   - Current Mirrors
   - Differential Pairs
   - Common Source/Emitter Amplifiers
   - Common Drain/Collector (Buffers)
   - Common Gate/Base Amplifiers

3. Functional Blocks:
   - Operational Amplifiers
   - Filters (Low-pass, High-pass, Band-pass)
   - Oscillators
   - Voltage Regulators
   - Comparators
   - Rectifiers
   - PLL (Phase-Locked Loops)
   - ADC/DAC (Analog-Digital Converters)

4. Power Blocks:
   - Power Supplies
   - Voltage References
   - Current Sources/Sinks
   - Power Amplifiers

The primary analog building blocks in electronics are:

1. Resistors: Control current and create voltage drops in circuits.
2. Capacitors: Store and release energy, filter signals, and smooth power supplies.
3. Inductors: Store energy in a magnetic field, filter AC signals, and create resonance in circuits.
4. Diodes: Allow current to flow in one direction, used for rectification and protection.
5. Transistors: Act as amplifiers and switches, fundamental in analog signal processing.
6. Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps): Used for signal amplification, filtering, and other analog functions.
7. Transformers: Transfer and step up/down AC voltages while isolating sections of circuits.
8. Analog Multipliers: Perform multiplication of two analog signals, used in modulation and signal processing.
9. Voltage Regulators: Maintain a constant output voltage, stabilizing power supplies.
10. Analog Filters: Shape frequency response, including low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and notch filters.

These components form the basis for analog signal processing, filtering, amplification, and power management in electronic circuits.
