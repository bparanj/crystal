### Automatic Voltage Shifting of an AC Signal with Peak Value

Automatic voltage shifting of an AC signal involves modifying its DC offset based on its peak value, such that the signal is aligned with a new reference voltage or shifted to a desired level. This is often done in circuits like automatic gain controllers (AGC), signal conditioners, or precision rectifiers.

### Concept:

1. Voltage Shifting:
   - Adjusting the AC signal's reference level (DC offset) to align its peaks or troughs with a desired voltage.
   - Achieved by combining the AC signal with a dynamically derived DC voltage from the signal itself.

2. Automatic Behavior:
   - The circuit automatically adjusts the DC offset in real time, based on the peak value of the AC signal.
   - Uses a peak detector circuit to monitor the AC signal's amplitude.

### Components:

1. AC Signal Source: Provides the input signal to be shifted.
2. Peak Detector Circuit:
   - Diode: Rectifies the signal.
   - Capacitor: Holds the peak voltage.
   - Resistor (optional): Sets the discharge rate for dynamic signals.
3. Summing Amplifier:
   - Combines the AC signal with the derived DC offset voltage from the peak detector.
4. Output Load: Displays or utilizes the shifted signal.

### Circuit

#### Components:

1. AC Voltage Source: \( V_{AC}(t) = A \sin(\omega t) \).
2. Peak Detector:
   - Diode: 1N4148.
   - Capacitor: \( C = 10\mu F \).
   - Resistor: \( R = 10k\Omega \) (optional, for discharge rate).
3. Operational Amplifier (Summing Amplifier).
4. Resistors for Summing Amplifier: \( R_1 = R_2 = 10k\Omega \).

### Circuit Operation:

1. Peak Detection:
   - The diode rectifies the AC signal, and the capacitor holds the peak voltage.
   - This peak value represents the dynamic DC offset voltage derived from the signal.

2. Summing Amplifier:
   - The summing amplifier adds the AC signal to the peak voltage detected.
   - The output is the shifted AC signal:
     \[
     V_{out}(t) = V_{AC}(t) + V_{peak}
     \]

### Steps

1. Connect the Peak Detector:
   - Feed the AC signal into the diode.
   - Connect the diode's output to the capacitor and resistor to derive the peak voltage.

2. Feed the Signals to the Summing Amplifier:
   - Connect the AC signal and the peak voltage to the inputs of the summing amplifier.
   - Use resistors to ensure proper scaling of the signals.

3. Observe the Output:
   - The output signal will be the AC signal shifted automatically by its peak voltage.

### Results:

1. Dynamic Shifting:
   - The AC signal is automatically shifted upwards or downwards by a voltage equal to its peak value.

2. Stable Output:
   - For a steady AC signal, the output is consistent.
   - For a dynamic signal, the peak detector ensures continuous adjustment.

### Applications:

1. Automatic Gain Control:
   - Aligning signals dynamically for uniform processing.

2. Signal Conditioning:
   - Shifting voltage levels for interfacing with specific systems.

3. Power Systems:
   - Aligning AC waveforms for rectification or energy management.

### Insights:

- The peak detector is critical for dynamic offset calculation.
- The summing amplifier provides precise voltage adjustment.
- This circuit is suitable for both sinusoidal and arbitrary AC waveforms.

This design is used to observe the dynamic voltage shifting behavior.
