If the output waveform is a flat line in the middle of the oscilloscope display across the resistor, it suggests that the output voltage is near zero or the signal is being attenuated entirely. Here's why this might happen and how to fix it:

### Possible Causes

1. Frequency Too Low:
   - At low frequencies (below the cutoff frequency), a high-pass filter blocks most of the input signal. This would result in little to no voltage across the resistor, appearing as a flat line.

2. Capacitor Value Too High:
   - If the capacitor's value is too large, the cutoff frequency (\(f_c\)) becomes very low. This causes the filter to block frequencies close to or above the input frequency, leading to minimal output.

3. Incorrect Connections:
   - Ensure the resistor is connected properly across the correct output terminals, and the capacitor is in series with the resistor.

4. Oscilloscope Settings:
   - The oscilloscope's time per division or voltage scale may not be set correctly, making small signals appear as a flat line.

### Steps to Troubleshoot and Fix

1. Increase Input Frequency:
   - Gradually increase the frequency from 10 Hz upward toward and beyond the cutoff frequency (\(f_c\)).
   - For the given values (\(R = 10 \, \text{k}\Omega, C = 0.1 \, \mu\text{F}\)), \(f_c \approx 159 \, \text{Hz}\). Signals below this frequency will be attenuated significantly.

2. Check Oscilloscope Settings:
   - Adjust the voltage scale on the output oscilloscope to a smaller range (e.g., \(1 \, \text{mV/div}\)) to detect smaller signals.
   - Ensure the time per division is appropriate for the signal frequency (e.g., \(10 \, \text{ms/div}\) for \(f = 100 \, \text{Hz}\)).

3. Verify Component Connections:
   - Confirm the capacitor is in series with the resistor.
   - Ensure the resistor is connected across the oscilloscope probes.

4. Test Higher Frequencies:
   - If increasing the frequency results in a sine wave appearing on the output oscilloscope, the filter is working as expected.
