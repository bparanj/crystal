## Requires and Conflicts Relationships

Yes, it is possible to capture the "requires" and "conflicts" relationships between objects in a graph. This can be done using concepts from graph theory, particularly through the use of directed and undirected graphs.

### **Requires Relationship**
- **Directed Graphs**: A directed graph (or digraph) can represent "requires" relationships. In this type of graph, each edge has a direction, indicating dependency. For example, if object A requires object B, there would be a directed edge from A to B.

### **Conflicts Relationship**
- **Undirected Graphs**: An undirected graph can represent "conflicts" relationships. In this type of graph, edges have no direction, indicating mutual exclusivity or conflict. For example, if object A conflicts with object B, there would be an undirected edge between A and B.

### **Graph Coloring**
- **Adjacency and Conflicts**: In graph coloring, vertices represent objects, and edges represent conflicts. The goal is to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices (conflicting objects) share the same colorÂ¹. This concept can be extended to capture conflicts in various applications, such as scheduling and resource allocation.

### **Example**
Imagine you have a set of tasks where some tasks depend on others (requires relationship) and some tasks cannot be performed simultaneously (conflicts relationship). You can represent this scenario using a graph:
- **Vertices**: Represent tasks.
- **Directed Edges**: Represent dependencies (requires relationship).
- **Undirected Edges**: Represent conflicts.
