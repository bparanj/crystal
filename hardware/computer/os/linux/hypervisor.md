## Hypervisor

The term **hypervisor** comes from the word "supervisor," which refers to a component in computer systems that manages the execution of processes. A **hypervisor** is "supervisor of supervisors," since it controls multiple operating systems running simultaneously on the same hardware.

### Origin:
- **Supervisor**: In traditional computing, the **supervisor** refers to the part of the operating system that manages system resources, processes, and memory. It ensures the correct operation of the system and oversees individual programs or processes.
- **Hypervisor**: The **prefix "hyper-"** means "above" or "beyond." In this context, a **hypervisor** manages multiple **supervisors** (i.e., multiple operating systems). It allows multiple virtual machines (each with its own OS) to run on a single physical machine, overseeing how they share resources.

### Key Points:
- **Hypervisor** manages the virtual machines (VMs), allocating CPU, memory, and I/O resources.
- It allows **virtualization**, where multiple VMs can run independently on the same hardware.
  
The term highlights its role in managing and overseeing multiple "supervised" systems or virtualized environments.

It is not included by default in Linux distributions.
