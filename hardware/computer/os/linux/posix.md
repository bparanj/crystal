POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a set of standardized specifications that define how operating systems should behave to ensure compatibility and portability of software across different systems. It specifies interfaces, utilities, and command-line tools, allowing programs written for one compliant system to run on another with minimal modification.

### Problem it addresses:

Before POSIX, UNIX-like systems varied in how they implemented system calls, commands, and features. It was difficult to write portable software that could run on different UNIX systems without significant changes. POSIX creates a standard interface that all compliant systems follow, simplifying software development, reducing incompatibilities, and improving cross-platform portability.

Yes, **POSIX** is still used today. It remains an important standard, particularly for ensuring compatibility and portability between different UNIX-like systems (such as Linux, macOS, and various BSD systems) and other operating systems that aim to be compliant. Many modern operating systems and software development environments implement or follow POSIX standards to ensure that applications can run across different platforms with minimal modification. 

While not all systems are fully POSIX-compliant, many still adhere to its core principles, especially for essential system interfaces, utilities, and command behavior. This makes POSIX highly relevant in ensuring interoperability in the software world.
