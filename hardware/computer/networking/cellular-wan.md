Cellular WAN (Wide Area Network) refers to a network that provides internet connectivity over cellular networks (such as 4G, 5G, LTE, or 3G). It uses the same mobile infrastructure as your phone to transmit data over large distances, allowing devices to connect to the internet without relying on traditional wired connections (like fiber or DSL).

Key features of cellular WAN include:

- **Wide coverage**: Cellular WAN is designed to cover large geographical areas, making it ideal for mobile devices, IoT, or remote locations.
- **Cellular technology**: It uses cellular towers and networks for communication, just like phones, enabling connectivity for various devices (routers, modems, etc.).
- **Mobility**: Since it doesn't require physical cables, devices can remain connected to the internet while moving, which is critical for mobile use cases like vehicles or on-the-go internet access.

Cellular WAN is commonly used as a primary or backup internet connection in places where traditional wired connections are unavailable or unreliable.
