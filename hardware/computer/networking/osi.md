| Layer Name | Key Words | Essence |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| 7. Application | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, Telnet, SNMP | User interface |
| 6. Presentation | JPEG, MPEG, ASCII, Encryption, SSL/TLS | Data format and encryption |
| 5. Session | NetBIOS, PPTP, RPC, SIP | Connection management |

| 2. Data Link | Ethernet, PPP, HDLC, Frame Relay, MAC addresses | Reliable node-to-node delivery |
| 1. Physical | Cables, Signals, Binary transmission, Hub, Repeater | Physical transmission medium |


The essence of each layer is described in just a few words to capture its core function:

1. Physical: Focuses on the  physical medium of data transmission.
2. Data Link: Ensures reliable data transfer between directly connected nodes.
3. Network: Handles routing and addressing for data packets across different networks.
4. Transport: Manages end-to-end communication between source and destination.
5. Session: Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections between applications.
6. Presentation: Deals with data formatting, compression, and encryption.
7. Application: Provides the interface for user applications to access network services.


| Layer | Process on Server |
|-------|-------------------|
| 7. Application | Generate data to be sent |
| 6. Presentation | Encrypt data (e.g., using SSL/TLS) |
| 5. Session | Establish and maintain connection |
| 4. Transport | Segment data and add TCP/UDP header |
| 3. Network | Add IP header, determine routing |
| 2. Data Link | Frame data, add MAC addresses |
| 1. Physical | Convert to binary and transmit signals |


This table shows how data moves down the OSI layers on the server side, with encryption  occurring at the Presentation layer.

| Layer | Process on Client |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1. Physical | Receive signals and convert to binary |
| 2. Data Link | Check frame integrity, remove frame header |
| 3. Network | Check IP header, remove if destination matches |
| 4. Transport | Reassemble segments, check sequence |
| 5. Session | Verify connection is active |
| 6. Presentation | Decrypt data (e.g., using SSL/TLS) |
| 7. Application | Process and present data to user |


This table illustrates how the encrypted data moves up the OSI layers on the client side, with decryption  occurring at the Presentation layer.

Key Takeaways:

1. The process flows from top to bottom on the server side, and from bottom to top on the client side.
2. Encryption and decryption usually occur at layer 6 (Presentation) using protocols like SSL/TLS.
3. Each layer adds its own headers or processing on the server side, which are then checked and removed in reverse order on the client side.
4. The  transmission occurs at the Physical layer (layer 1).
5. The Session layer (layer 5) ensures the connection remains active throughout the process.
6. The Transport layer (layer 4) handles segmentation on the server side and reassembly on the client side.


SSH client side:

| OSI Layer | SSH Client Operations |
|-----------|------------------------|
| 7. Application | User initiates SSH connection, provides credentials |
| 6. Presentation | Encryption of data (e.g., AES), compression |
| 5. Session | SSH protocol negotiation, authentication |
| 4. Transport | TCP connection establishment ( to port 22) |
| 3. Network | IP packet routing |
| 2. Data Link | Framing of data for network interface |
| 1. Physical | Bits transmitted over physical medium |


Now, let's create a table for the SSH server side:

| OSI Layer | SSH Server Operations |
|-----------|------------------------|
| 1. Physical | Bits received from physical medium |
| 2. Data Link | Frame check and data extraction |
| 3. Network | IP packet processing |
| 4. Transport | TCP connection acceptance on port 22 |
| 5. Session | SSH protocol handling, user authentication |
| 6. Presentation | Decryption of data, decompression |
| 7. Application | Execution of user commands, shell provision |


Key points:

1. Application Layer (7):
   - Client: User initiates the connection, possibly using a command like `ssh user@host`.
   - Server: Provides a shell or executes commands after successful authentication.

2. Presentation Layer (6):
   - Both sides handle encryption/decryption (e.g., using AES) and potentially compression.

3. Session Layer (5):
   - Manages the SSH protocol,  version negotiation and authentication methods.

4. Transport Layer (4):
   - Uses TCP,  on port 22, for reliable, ordered data delivery.

5. Network Layer (3):
   - Handles IP routing between client and server.

6. Data Link Layer (2):
   - Manages the framing of data for the specific network interface.

7. Physical Layer (1):
   - Represents the  transmission medium (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

SSH, like many modern protocols, doesn't strictly adhere to the OSI model. It primarily operates at the Application layer but incorporates functions that span multiple layers, particularly in its handling of encryption and authentication.

Tables showing how HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) operates through the OSI layers on both the client and server sides.

| OSI Layer | HTTP Client Operations |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| 7. Application | User requests webpage, HTTP request formation (GET, POST, etc.) |
| 6. Presentation | Optional encryption (HTTPS), data formatting |
| 5. Session | Not explicitly used in HTTP (stateless), but may use cookies |
| 4. Transport | TCP connection establishment ( to port 80 or 443) |
| 3. Network | IP packet routing |
| 2. Data Link | Framing of data for network interface |
| 1. Physical | Bits transmitted over physical medium |


Table for the HTTP server side:


| OSI Layer | HTTP Server Operations |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| 1. Physical | Bits received from physical medium |
| 2. Data Link | Frame check and data extraction |
| 3. Network | IP packet processing |
| 4. Transport | TCP connection acceptance ( on port 80 or 443) |
| 5. Session | Not explicitly used in HTTP (stateless), but may use cookies |
| 6. Presentation | Optional decryption (HTTPS), data interpretation |
| 7. Application | HTTP request processing, response generation |


Key points about HTTP operation through the OSI layers:

1. Application Layer (7):
   - Client: Forms HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) based on user actions.
   - Server: Processes HTTP requests and generates appropriate responses.

2. Presentation Layer (6):
   - Handles data formatting and optional encryption/decryption if HTTPS is used.
   - For HTTPS, this layer would involve SSL/TLS protocols.

3. Session Layer (5):
   - HTTP itself is stateless and doesn't use this layer explicitly.
   - However, session management can be implemented using cookies or other methods at the application level.

4. Transport Layer (4):
   - Uses TCP,  on port 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS.
   - Ensures reliable, ordered data delivery.

5. Network Layer (3):
   - Handles IP routing between client and server.

6. Data Link Layer (2):
   - Manages the framing of data for the specific network interface.

7. Physical Layer (1):
   - Represents the  transmission medium (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

While HTTP primarily operates at the Application layer, the use of HTTPS (HTTP Secure) incorporates functions that span multiple layers, particularly in its handling of encryption.


| OSI Layer | Elements and Operations |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| 7. Application | - HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)<br>- HTTP headers (User-Agent, Accept, Content-Type, etc.)<br>- Status codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.)<br>- URLs and URIs<br>- Cookies for session management |
| 6. Presentation | - Character encoding (UTF-8, ASCII, etc.)<br>- Data compression/decompression (gzip, deflate)<br>- SSL/TLS for HTTPS (encryption, decryption, certificate handling) |
| 5. Session | - While HTTP is stateless, technologies used here include:<br>  - Cookies<br>  - Session tokens<br>  - Keep-alive connections |
| 4. Transport | - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)<br>- Port numbers (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS)<br>- Segmentation of data<br>- Flow control and error correction |
| 3. Network | - IP (Internet Protocol) addressing<br>- Routing between networks<br>- Packet forwarding<br>- Fragmentation and reassembly of packets |
| 2. Data Link | - MAC (Media Access Control) addressing<br>- Ethernet frames<br>- Error detection (CRC)<br>- Flow control between adjacent network nodes |
| 1. Physical | - Network Interface Cards (NICs)<br>- Cables (Ethernet, fiber optic)<br>- Wireless signals (Wi-Fi)<br>- Hubs and repeaters<br>- Bit-level data transmission |


This table provides a detailed look at the elements and operations involved in HTTP communication at each OSI layer. 

1. Application Layer: HTTP requests and responses are formed here. The client sends methods like GET or POST, while the server responds with status codes and requested data.

2. Presentation Layer: Data is formatted, compressed, or encrypted here. For HTTPS, SSL/TLS protocols handle encryption and decryption.

3. Session Layer: While HTTP is stateless, session management can be handled using cookies or tokens, which are passed in HTTP headers.

4. Transport Layer: TCP manages the connection, breaking data into segments, ensuring ordered delivery, and handling flow control.

5. Network Layer: IP handles addressing and routing of packets between different networks.

6. Data Link Layer: Ethernet frames are created, embedding the MAC addresses of the source and destination for local network transmission.

7. Physical Layer: The  transmission of bits occurs here, whether through electrical signals in cables or radio waves for Wi-Fi.
